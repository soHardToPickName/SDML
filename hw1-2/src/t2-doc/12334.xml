Yang-Mills Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss bosonic and supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models with compact
semi-simple gauge group. We begin by finding convergence conditions for the
partition and correlation functions. Moving on, we specialise to the SU(N)
models with large N. In both the Yang-Mills and cohomological formulations, we
find all quantities which are invariant under the supercharges. Finally, we
apply the deformation method of Moore, Nekrasov and Shatashvili directly to the
Yang-Mills model. We find a deformation of the action which generates mass
terms for all the matrix fields whilst preserving some supersymmetry. This
allows us to rigorously integrate over a BRST quartet and arrive at the well
known formula of MNS.
