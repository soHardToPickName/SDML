Brane Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of these lectures is to give a brief introduction to brane cosmology.
After introducing some basic geometrical notions, we discuss the cosmology of a
brane universe with matter localized on the brane. Then we introduce an
intrinsic curvature scalar term in the bulk action, and analyze the cosmology
of this induced gravity. Finally we present the cosmology of a moving brane in
the background of other branes, and as a particular example, we discuss the
cosmological evolution of a test brane moving in a background of a Type-0
string theory.
