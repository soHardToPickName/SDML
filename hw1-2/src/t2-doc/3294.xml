Supersymmetry and the Systematics of T-duality Rotations in Type-II
  Superstring Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a systematic method of studying the action of the T-duality group
O(d,d) on space-time fermions and R-R field strengths and potentials in type-II
string theories, based on space-time supersymmetry. The formalism is then used
to show that the couplings of non-Abelian D-brane charges to R-R potentials can
be described by an appropriate Clifford multiplication.
