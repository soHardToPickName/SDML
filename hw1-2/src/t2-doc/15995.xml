Conformal Field Theory Correlators from Classical Scalar Field Theory on
  $AdS_{d+1}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the correspondence between scalar field theory on $AdS_{d+1}$ and a
conformal field theory on $R^d$ to calculate the 3- and 4-point functions of
the latter. The classical scalar field theory action is evaluated at tree
level.
