A Comment on Non-Chiral Operators in SQCD and its Dual
</title>

<abstract>
  We match a few non chiral operators in the electric and magnetic descriptions
of SQCD, suggesting the first evidence of electric-magnetic duality outside the
chiral ring. Algebraically, these non chiral operators are a module of the
chiral ring. Physically, the suggested correspondence essentially transforms
certain electric gauge invariant composites containing the electric field
strength into magnetic matter composites.
