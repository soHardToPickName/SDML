Geometric Classification of Topological Quantum Phases
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of the principle that topological quantum phases arise from the
scattering around space-time defects in higher dimensional unification, a
geometric model is presented that associates with each quantum phase an element
of a transformation group.
