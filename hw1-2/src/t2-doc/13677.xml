Some properties of generalized connections in quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum completion of the space of connections in a manifold can be seen
as the set of all morphisms from the groupoid of the edges of the manifold to
the (compact) gauge group. This algebraic construction generalizes the
analogous description of the gauge-invariant quantum configuration space of
Ashtekar and Isham. We present a description of the groupoid approach which
brings the gauge-invariant degrees of freedom to the foreground, thus making
the action of the gauge group more transparent.
