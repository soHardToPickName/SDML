Renormalization Ambiguities in Casimir Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  Some questions were recently raised about the equivalence of two methods
commonly used to compute the Casimir energy: the mode summation approach and
the one-loop effective potential. In this respect, we argue that the scale
dependence induced by renormalization effects, displayed by the effective
potential approach, also appears in the MS method.
