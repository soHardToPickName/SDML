On particle production by classical backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  The theory of quantum fields in classical backgrounds is re-examined for the
cases in which the Lagrangian is quadratic in quantum fields. Various methods
that describe particle production are discussed. It is found that all methods
suffer from certain ambiguities, related to the choice of coordinates, gauge,
or counter-terms. They also seem to be inconsistent with the conservation of
energy. This suggests that such classical backgrounds may not cause particle
production.
