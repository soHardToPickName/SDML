The Construction of Pointlike Localized Charged Fields from Conformal
  Haag-Kastler Nets
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a chiral conformal Haag-Kastler net on 2 dimensional Minkowski
space we construct associated charged pointlike localized fields which
intertwine between arbitrary superselection sectors with finite statistics of
the theory. This amounts to a proof of the Spin-Statistics theorem, the PCT
theorem and the existence of operator product expansions. This paper
generalizes similar results of a recently published paper by Fredenhagen and
the author \cite{FrJ} from the neutral vacuum sector to the the full theory
with arbitrary charge and finite statistics.
