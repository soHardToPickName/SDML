Dualities in D=5, N=2 Supergravity, Black Hole Entropy, and AdS Central
  Charges

  The issue of microstate counting for general black holes in D=5, N=2
supergravity coupled to vector multiplets is discussed from various viewpoints.
The statistical entropy is computed for the near-extremal case by using the
central charge appearing in the asymptotic symmetry algebra of AdS_2.
Furthermore, we show that the considered supergravity theory enjoys a duality
invariance which connects electrically charged black holes and magnetically
charged black strings. The near-horizon geometry of the latter turns out to be
AdS_3 x S^2, which allows a microscopic calculation of their entropy using the
Brown-Henneaux central charges in Cardy's formula. In both approaches we find
perfect agreement between statistical and thermodynamical entropy.
