E_8 x E_8 Small Instantons in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A formulation of new six-dimensional theories with (1,0) supersymmetry and
E_8 global symmetry is proposed. The model is based on the large n theory
describing n D-strings interacting with parallel D-fivebranes in Type I string
theory.
