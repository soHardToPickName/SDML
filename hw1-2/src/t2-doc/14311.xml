Remarks on excited states of affine Toda solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  The identification in affine Toda field theory of the quantum particle with
the lowest breather allows us to re-interpret discrete modes of excitation of
solitons as breathers bound to solitons, and thus to investigate them through
the proposed soliton-breather S-matrices. There are implications for the
physical spectrum and for the semiclassical soliton mass corrections.
