A new exactly solvable Eckart-type potential
</title>

<abstract>
  A new exact analytically solvable Eckart-type potential is presented, a
generalisation of the Hulthen potential. The study through Supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics is presented together with the hierarchy of Hamiltonians and
the shape invariance property.
