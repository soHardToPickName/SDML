Black holes and thermodynamics of non-gravitational theories
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a thesis/review article that combines some of the results of
hep-th/9809061, hep-th/9810224 and hep-th/9901135 with a short discussion of
introductory background material; an attempt has been made to present the work
in a self-contained manner. The first chapter mostly targets readers who are
vaguely familiar with traditional and contemporary string theory. Chapter two
discusses in detail the thermodynamics of the 0+1 dimensional Super Yang-Mills
(SYM) theory as an illustrative example of the main ideas of the work. The
third chapter outlines the phase structures of p+1 dimensional SYM theories on
tori for 1<=p<=5, and that of the D1D5 system; we avoid presenting the
technical details of the construction of these phase diagrams, focusing instead
on the physics of the final results. The last chapter discusses the dynamics of
the formation of boosted black holes in strongly coupled SYM theory.
