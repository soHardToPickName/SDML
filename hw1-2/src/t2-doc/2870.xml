On the R-Matrix Formulation of Deformed Algebras and Generalized
  Jordan-Wigner Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  The deformed algebra $\cal{A(R)}$, depending upon a Yang-Baxter R- matrix, is
considered. The conditions under which the algebra is associative are discussed
for a general number of oscillators. Four types of solutions satisfying these
conditions are constructed and two of them can be represented by generalized
Jordan-Wigner transformations.Our analysis is in some sense an extension of the
boson realization of fermions from single-mode to multimode oscillators.
