5D $SU(3)_W$ unification at TeV and cancellation of local gauge
  anomalies with split multiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the 5D gauge unification of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ into $SU(3)_W$
at a TeV scale. Compactification of the extra dimension on an orbifold
$S^1/(Z_2\times Z'_2)$ allows fixed points where $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$
representations can be assigned. We explain the long proton lifetime and the
top-bottom mass hierarchy and etc. geometrically. We also show that local gauge
anomalies on the orbifold can be exactly cancelled by a 5D Chern-Simons term
with a jumping coefficient.
