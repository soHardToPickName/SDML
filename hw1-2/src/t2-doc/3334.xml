Lectures on open strings, and noncommutative gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The background independent formulation of the gauge theories on D-branes in
flat space-time is considered, some examples of the solutions of their
equations of motion are presented, the solutions of Dirac equation in these
backgrounds are analyzed, and the generalizations to the curved spaces, like
orbifolds, conifolds, and K3 surfaces, are discussed.
