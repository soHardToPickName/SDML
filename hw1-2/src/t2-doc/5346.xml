Boundary One-Point Functions, Scattering, and Background Vacuum
  Solutions in Toda Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The parametric families of integrable boundary affine Toda theories are
considered. We calculate boundary one-point functions and propose boundary
S-matrices in these theories. We use boundary one-point functions and S-matrix
amplitudes to derive boundary ground state energies and exact solutions
describing classical vacuum configurations.
