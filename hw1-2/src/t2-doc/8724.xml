Monopoles and Strings in Noncommutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some non-perturbative aspects of noncommutative gauge theories. We
find analytic solutions of the equations of motion, for noncommutative U(1)
gauge theory, that describe magnetic monopoles with a finite tension string
attached. These solutions are non-singular, finite and sourceless. We identify
the string with the projection of a D-string ending on a D3-brane in the
presence of a constant B-field.
