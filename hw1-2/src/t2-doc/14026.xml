A W-String Realization of the Bosonic String
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been shown that the ordinary bosonic string can be
represented by a special background of N=1 or N=2 strings. In this paper, it
will be shown that the bosonic string can also be represented by a special
background of $W$-strings.
