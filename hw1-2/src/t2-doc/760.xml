Truncation of functional relations in the XXZ model
</title>

<abstract>
  This is the abstract of the revised paper. The integrable XXZ model with a
special open boundary condition is considered. We study Sklyanin transfer
matrices after quantum group reduction in roots of unity. In this case Sklyanin
transfer matrices satisfy a closed system of truncated functional equations.
The algebraic reason for the truncation is found.The important role in proving
of the result is performed by Zamolodchikov algebra introduced in the paper.
