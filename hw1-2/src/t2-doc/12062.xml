Supersymmetric quantum mechanics, the variational method and a new shape
  invariant potential
</title>

<abstract>
  The association of the variational method with supersymmetric quantum
mechanics through an ansatz for the superpotential is reviewed and the
approximate energy spectra of non-exactly solvable potentials, such like the
Hulthen, the Morse and the screened Coulomb potentials, in 3 dimensions, are
presented. A sketch of a new exactly shape invariant potential is also
presented.
