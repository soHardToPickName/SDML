Algebraic characterization of the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions in
  gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A new way of solving the descent equations corresponding to the Wess-Zumino
consistency conditions is presented. The method relies on the introduction of
an operator $\delta$ which allows to decompose the exterior space-time
derivative $d$ as a $BRS$ commutator. The case of the Yang-Mills theories is
treated in detail.
