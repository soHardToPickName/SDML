Laughlin states on the Poincare half-plane and its quantum group
  symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the Laughlin states of the electrons on the Poincare half-plane in
different representations. In each case we show that there exist a quantum
group $su_q(2)$ symmetry such that the Laughlin states are a representation of
it. We calculate the corresponding filling factor by using the plasma analogy
of the FQHE.
