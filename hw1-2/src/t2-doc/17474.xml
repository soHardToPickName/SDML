Strong field limit of the Born-Infeld p-form electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the strong field limit of p-form Born-Infeld theory. It turns out
that this limiting theory is a unique theory displaying the full symmetry group
of the underlying canonical structure. Moreover, being a nonlinear theory, it
possesses an infinite hierarchy of conservation laws.
