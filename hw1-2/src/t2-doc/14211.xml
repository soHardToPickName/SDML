The torus and the Klein Bottle amplitude of permutation orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  The torus and the Klein bottle amplitude coefficients are computed in
permutation orbifolds of RCFT-s in terms of the same quantities in the original
theory and the twist group. An explicit expression is presented for the number
of self conjugate primaries in the orbifold as a polynomial of the total number
of primaries and the number of self conjugate ones in the parent theory. The
formulae in the $Z_2$ orbifold illustrate the general results.
