Wormholes on The World Volume
</title>

<abstract>
  I describe some recent work in which classical solutions of Dirac-Born-Infeld
theory may be used to throw light on some properties of M-theory. The sources
of Born-Infeld theory are the ends of strings ending on the world volume.
Equivalently the fundamental string may be regarded as merely a thin and
extended piece of the world volume.
