Gelfand-Dikii Brackets for Nonstandard Supersymmetric Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how a general nonstandard Lax equation (supersymmetric or otherwise)
can be expressed as a standard Lax equation. This enables us to define the
Gelfand-Dikii brackets for a nonstandard supersymmetric equation. We discuss
the Hamiltonian structures for the nonstandard super KP system and work out
explicitly the two Hamiltonian structures of the supersymmetric Two Boson
system from this point of view.
