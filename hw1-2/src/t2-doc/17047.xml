A de-Sitter thick domain wall solution by elliptic functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain and study an analytical solution of a de-Sitter thick domain wall
in five-dimensional Einstein gravity interacting with a scalar field. The
scalar field potential is axion-like, V(phi)=a+b cos(phi) with constants a,b
satisfying -3b<5a<3b, and the solution is expressed in terms of elliptic
functions.
