A uniform model of the massive spinning particle in any dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  The general model of an arbitrary spin massive particle in any dimensional
space-time is derived on the basis of Kirillov - Kostant - Souriau approach. It
is shown that the model allows consistent coupling to an arbitrary background
of electromagnetic and gravitational fields.
