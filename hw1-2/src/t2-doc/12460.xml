Mirror Fermions in Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper we pointed out the presence of extra fermionic degrees of
freedom in a chiral gauge theory based on Connes Noncommutative Geometry. Here
we propose a mechanism which provides a high mass to these mirror states, so
that they decouple from low energy physics.
