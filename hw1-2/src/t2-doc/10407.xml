On Flux Quantization In M-Theory And The Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization law for the antisymmetric tensor field of $M$-theory
contains a gravitational contribution not known previously. When it is
included, the low energy effective action of $M$-theory, including one-loop and
Chern-Simons contributions, is well-defined. The relation of $M$-theory to the
$E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string greatly facilitates the analysis.
