The Principle of the Fermionic Projector III, Normalization of the
  Fermionic States
</title>

<abstract>
  The normalization of the states of the fermionic projector is analyzed. By
considering the system in finite 4-volume and taking the infinite volume limit,
it is made precise what "idempotence" of the fermionic projector means. It is
shown that for each fermionic state, the probability integral has a
well-defined infinite volume limit.
