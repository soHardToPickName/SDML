Supersymmetric extension of Moyal algebra and its application to the
  matrix model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct operator representation of Moyal algebra in the presence of
fermionic fields. The result is used to describe the matrix model in Moyal
formalism, that treat gauge degrees of freedom and outer degrees of freedom
equally.
