(2,0)-Super-Yang-Mills Coupled to Non-Linear Sigma-Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Considering a class of (2,0)-super-Yang-Mills multiplets that accommodate a
pair of independent gauge potentials in connection with a single symmetry
group, we present here their coupling to ordinary matter and to non-linear
$\sigma$-models in (2,0)-superspace. The dynamics and the couplings of the
gauge potentials are discussed and the interesting feature that comes out is a
sort of ``chirality'' for one of the gauge potentials once light-cone
coordinates are chosen.
