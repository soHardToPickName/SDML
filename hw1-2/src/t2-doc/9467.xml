D-Brane Solutions from New Isometries of pp-Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We use recently proposed translations isometries of pp-waves to construct D4
and D3 brane solutions, using T-duality transformations, in exactly solvable
pp-wave background originating from $AdS_3\times S^3$ geometry. A unique
property of the new brane solutions is the breaking of SO(10-p-1) symmetry in
the transverse direction of the branes due to the presence of constant NS-NS
and R-R background fluxes. We verify that the our `localized' solutions satisfy
the field equations and explicitly present the corresponding Killing spinors.
We also show the connection of our results to certain M5-branes in pp-wave
geometry.
