S-Duality and Global Symmetries in N=2 Supersymmetric Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  S-dualities in scale invariant N=2 supersymmetric field theories are derived
by embedding those theories in asymptotically free N=2 theories with higher
rank gauge groups. S-duality transformations on the coupling of the scale
invariant theory follow from global symmetries acting on the Coulomb branch of
the higher rank theory. Since these global symmetries are exact in the
asymptotically free theory, this shows that S-duality is an exact equivalence
of N=2 theories and not just a property of their supersymmetric states.
