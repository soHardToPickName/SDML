Collapsing D-branes in one-parameter models and small/large radius
  duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We finalize the study of collapsing D-branes in one-parameter models by
completing the analysis of the associated hypergeometric hierarchy. This brings
further evidence that the phenomenon of collapsing 6-branes at the mirror of
the `conifold' point in IIA compactifications on one-parameter Calabi-Yau
manifolds is generic. It also completes the reduction of the study of higher
periods in one-parameter models to a few families which display characteristic
behaviour. One of the models we consider displays an exotic form of small-large
radius duality, which is a consequence of an ``accidental'' discrete symmetry
of its moduli space. We discuss the implementation of this symmetry at the
level of the associated type II string compactification and its action on
D-brane states. We also argue that this model admits two special Lagrangian
fibrations and that the symmetry can be understood as their exchange.
