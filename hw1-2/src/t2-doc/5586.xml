Gauge Theory of Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum gravity is formulated based on principle of local gauge
invariance. The model discussed in this paper has local gravitational gauge
symmetry and gravitational field appears as gauge field. The problems on
quantization and renormalization of the theory are also discussed in this
paper. In leading order approximation, the gravitational gauge field theory
gives out classical Newton's theory of gravity. In first order approximation
and for vacuum, the gravitational gauge field theory gives out Einstein's
general theory of relativity. This quantum gauge theory of gravity is a
renormalizable quantum theory.
