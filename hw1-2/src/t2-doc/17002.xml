Classical Implications of the Minimal Length Uncertainty Relation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the phenomenological implications of the classical limit of the
"stringy" commutation relations [x_i,p_j]=i hbar[(1+beta p^2) delta_{ij} +
beta' p_i p_j]. In particular, we investigate the "deformation" of Kepler's
third law and apply our result to the rotation curves of gas and stars in
spiral galaxies.
