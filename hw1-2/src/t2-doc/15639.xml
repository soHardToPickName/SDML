Affine Kac-Moody Algebras and the Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
</title>

<abstract>
  These lecture notes are a brief introduction to Wess-Zumino-Witten models,
and their current algebras, the affine Kac-Moody algebras. After reviewing the
general background, we focus on the application of representation theory to the
computation of 3-point functions and fusion rules.
