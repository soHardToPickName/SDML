Fractional Supersymmetry and Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetry and super-Lie algebras have been consistently generalized
previously. The so-called fractional supersymmetry and $F-$Lie algebras could
be constructed starting from any representation $\D$ of any Lie algebra $g$.
This involves taking the $F^{\mathrm th}$ root of $\D$ in some sense. We show,
after having constructed differential realization(s) of any Lie algebra, how
fractional supersymmetry can be explicitly realized in terms of appropriate
homogeneous monomials.
