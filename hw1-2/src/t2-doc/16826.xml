Differential Calculi on Quantum (Sub-) Groups and Their Classical Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  For the two-parameter matrix quantum group GLp,q(2) all bicovariant
differential calculi (with a four-dimensional space of 1-forms) are known. They
form a one-parameter family. Here, we give an improved presentation of previous
results by using a different parametrization. We also discuss different ways to
obtain bicovariant calculi on the quantum subgroup SLq(2). For those calculi,
we do not obtain the ordinary differential calculus on SL(2) in the classical
limit. The structure which emerges here can be generalized to a nonstandard
differential calculus on an arbitrary differentiable manifold and exhibits
relations with stochastic calculus and `proper time' relativistic quantum
theories.
