On the validity of ADM formulation in 2D quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate 2d gravity quantized in the ADM formulation, where only the
loop length $l(z)$ is retained as a dynamical variable of the gravitation, in
order to get an intuitive physical insight of the theory. The effective action
of $l(z)$ is calculated by adding scalar fields of conformal coupling, and the
problems of the critical dimension and the time development of $l$ are
addressed.
