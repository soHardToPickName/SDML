Unitary Continuous Representations of Compact Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing the notion of continuous Hilbert space representations of
compact topological groups we define unitary continuous correpresentations of
$C^*$-completions of compact quantum group Hopf algebras on arbitrary Hilbert
spaces. It is proved that the unitary continuous correpresentations decompose
in finite dimensional irreducible correpresentations.
