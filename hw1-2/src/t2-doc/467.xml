Brane-Intersection Dynamics from Branes in Brane Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the dynamics of M-brane intersections from the worldvolume action
of one brane in the background supergravity solution of another one. In this
way we obtain an effective action for the self-dual string boundary of an
M2-brane in an M5-brane, and show that the dynamics of the 3-brane intersection
of two M5-branes is described by a Dirac-Born-Infeld action.
