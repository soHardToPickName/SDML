Time Measurement in Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss time measurement in quantum gravity. Using general relativity for
large distances and the uncertainty principle we find a minimum time interval
of the order of the Planck time, therefore the uncertainty in time measurment
is bounded from below.
