Einstein spaces in five and seven dimensions and non-supersymmetric
  gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A one-parameter family of new solutions representing Einstein spaces in
$d=5,7$ is presented, and used to construct non-supersymmetric backgrounds in
type IIB and M-theory that asymptotically approach $AdS_5\times S^5$ and
$AdS_7\times S^4$ . Upon dimensional reduction, the latter gives a type IIA
solution representing a 4-brane with Ramond-Ramond charge, which interpolates
between the "near-horizon" non-extremal D4 brane and a geometry connected by
T-duality to a new constant dilaton solution in type IIB. We discuss the
possibility that M-theory on this space may be related to a (0,2)
six-dimensional field theory on $S^1\times S^1$, with fermions obeying
antiperiodic boundary conditions in both circles.
