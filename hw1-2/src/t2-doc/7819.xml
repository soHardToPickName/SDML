Embedding Second Class Systems via Symplectic Gauge-invariant Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we reformulate Abelian and non-Abelian noninvariant systems as
gauge invariant theories using a new constraint conversion scheme, developed on
the symplectic framework. This conversion method is not plagued by the
ambiguity problem that torments the BFFT and iterative methods and also it
seems more powerful since it does not require special modifications to handle
with non-Abelian systems.
