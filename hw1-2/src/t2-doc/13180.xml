Hermitian Jordan Triple Systems, the Standard Model plus Gravity, and
  Alpha = 1/137.03608
</title>

<abstract>
  A physical interpretation is given for some Hermitian Jordan triple systems
(HJTS) that were recently discussed by Gunaydin (hep-th/9301050). Quadratic
Jordan algebras derived from HJTS provide a formulation of quantum mechanics
that is a natural framework within which exceptional structures are identified
with physically realistic structures of a quantum field theory that includes
both the standard model and MacDowell-Mansouri gravity. The structures allow
the calculation of the relative strengths of the four forces, including the
fine structure constant ALPHA = 1/137.03608.
