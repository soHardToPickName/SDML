Tetrahedron equation and the algebraic geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The tetrahedron equation arises as a generalization of the famous
Yang---Baxter equation to the 2+1-dimensional quantum field theory and the
3-dimensional statistical mechanics. Very little is still known about its
solutions. Here a systematic method is described that does produce non-trivial
solutions to the tetrahedron equation with spin-like variables on the links.
The essence of the method is the use of the so-called tetrahedral Zamolodchikov
algebras.
