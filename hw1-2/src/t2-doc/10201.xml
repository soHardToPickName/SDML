Non-Perturbative Decoupling of Heavy Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that heavy fermions decouple from the low energy physics also in
non-perturbative instanton effects. Provided the heavy fermions are lighter
than the symmetry breaking scale, all the instanton effects should be expressed
as local operators in the effective Lagrangian. The effective theory itself
doesn't admit instantons. We present the mechanism which suppresses instantons
in the effective theory.
