Duality of massive gauge invariant theories in arbitrary space-time
  dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that dualization of Stueckelberg-like massive gauge theories and
$B\wedge F$ models, follows form a general p-dualization of interacting
theories in d spacetime dimensions. This is achieved by a particular choice of
the external current.
