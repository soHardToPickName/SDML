Noncommutative Supersymmetric Gauge Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the general method of hep-th/0009192 to compute the consistent
gauge anomaly for noncommutative 4d SSYM coupled to chiral matter. The choice
of the minimal homotopy path allows us to obtain a simple and compact result.
We perform the reduction to components in the WZ gauge proving that our result
contains, as lowest component, the bosonic chiral anomaly for noncommutative YM
theories recently obtained in literature.
