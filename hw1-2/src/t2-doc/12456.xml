Quantum parameter space and double scaling limits in N=1 super
  Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the physics of N=1 super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group U(Nc)
and one adjoint Higgs field, by using the recently derived exact effective
superpotentials. Interesting phenomena occur for some special values of the
Higgs potential couplings. We find critical points with massless glueballs
and/or massless monopoles, confinement without a mass gap, and tensionless
domain walls. We describe the transitions between regimes with different
patterns of gauge symmetry breaking, or, in the matrix model language, between
solutions with a different number of cuts. The standard large Nc expansion is
singular near the critical points, with domain walls tensions scaling as a
fractional power of Nc. We argue that the critical points are four dimensional
analogues of the Kazakov critical points that are commonly found in low
dimensional matrix integrals. We define a double scaling limit that yields the
exact tension of BPS two-branes in the resulting N=1, four dimensional
non-critical string theory. D-brane states can be deformed continuously into
closed string solitonic states and vice-versa along paths that go over regions
where the string coupling is strong.
