Quantization of the Lie Algebra SO(2N+1) and of the Lie Superalgebra
  Osp(1/2N) with Preoscillator Generators
</title>

<abstract>
  The Lie algebra $so(2n+1)$ and the Lie superalgebra $osp(1/2n)$ are quantized
in terms of $3n$ generators, called preoscillator generators. Apart from $n$
"Cartan" elements the preoscillator generators are deformed para-Fermi
operators in the case of $so(2n+1)$ and deformed para-Bose operators in the
case of $osp(1/2n)$. The corresponding deformed universal enveloping algebras
$U_q[so(2n+1)]$ and $U_q[osp(1/2n)]$ are the same as those defined in terms of
Chevalley operators. The name "preoscillator" is to indicate that in a certain
representation these operators reduce to the known deformed Fermi and Bose
operators.
