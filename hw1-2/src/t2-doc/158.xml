Algebraic characterization of gauge anomalies on a nontrivial bundle
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the algebraic way of solving the descent equations corresponding
to the BRST consistency condition for the gauge anomalies and the Chern--Simons
terms on a nontrivial bundle. The method of decomposing the exterior derivative
as a BRST commutator is extended to the present case.
