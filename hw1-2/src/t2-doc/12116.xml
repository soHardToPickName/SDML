Local symmetry in the Kazakov-Migdal gauge model
</title>

<abstract>
  The spectrum of observables in the induced lattice gauge model proposed
recently by V.A.Kazakov and A.A.Migdal obeys the local-confinement selection
rule. The underlying local continuous symmetry cannot be spontaneously broken
within the model.
