Nonpointlike Particles in Harmonic Oscillators
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum mechanics ordinarily describes particles as being pointlike, in the
sense that the uncertainty $\Delta x$ can, in principle, be made arbitrarily
small. It has been shown that suitable correction terms to the canonical
commutation relations induce a finite lower bound to spatial localisation.
Here, we perturbatively calculate the corrections to the energy levels of an in
this sense nonpointlike particle in isotropic harmonic oscillators. Apart from
a special case the degeneracy of the energy levels is removed.
