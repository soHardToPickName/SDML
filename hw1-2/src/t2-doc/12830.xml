A Quantum Analysis on Recombination Process and Dynamics of D-p-branes
  at one angle
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantum-mechanical technique is used within the framework of U(2)
super-Yang-Mills theory to describe recombination processes of two D-p-branes
at one angle; how tachyons condense starting from certain initial conditions,
and how (curved) shapes of the recombined branes develop. Two types of initial
conditions are considered: branes at one angle made put from parallel ones at
the initial moment, and the ones approaching each other slowly, which is
important as a candidate of inflation mechanism. An interesting behavior of the
branes' shapes is shown to appear, each of which comes to have multiple (three)
extremes due to localization of tachyon condensation but not the effect of
compact spaces. Blowing-up behavior of pair-creations of stings connecting the
recombined branes are also observed. The above two behaviors means that the
branes in the process have a relatively stronger tendency than naively
expected, to dissipate their energy into radiations of gravitational and (RR
and NSNS) gauge fields. This implies that the tachyonic preheating era might be
rather short if this set-up is applied to the braneworld scenarios.
