Linear Dilaton Background and Fully Localized Intersecting Five-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a near-horizon geometry of NS5-branes wrapping on a Riemann
surface, which asymptotically approaches to linear dilaton backgrounds. We
concretely find a fully localized solution of the near-horizon geometry of
intersecting NS5-branes. We also discuss a relation to a description of
Landau-Ginzburg theories.
