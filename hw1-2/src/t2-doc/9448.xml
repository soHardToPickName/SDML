Brane dynamics for treatment of cosmic strings and vortons
</title>

<abstract>
  This course provides a self contained introduction to the general theory of
relativistic brane models, of the category that includes point particle,
string, and membrane representations for phenomena that can be considered as
being confined to a worldsheet of the corresponding dimension (respectively
one, two, and three) in a thin limit approximation. The first part of the
course is concerned with purely kinematic aspects: it is shown how, to second
differential order, the geometry (and in particular the inner and outer
curvature) of a brane worldsheet of arbitrary dimension is describable in terms
of the first, second, and third fundamental tensor; the extension to a
foliation by a congruence of such worldsheets is also briefly discussed. In the
next part, it is shown how -- to lowest order in the thin limit -- the
evolution of such a brane worldsheet will always be governed by a simple
tensorial equation of motion whose left hand side is the contraction of the
second fundamental tensor with the relevant surface stress tensor, while the
right hand side will simply vanish in the case of free motion and will
otherwise be just the orthogonal projection of any external force density that
may happen to act on the brane. (Allowance for first order deviations from such
a thin limit treatment would require evolution equations of a more complicated
kind of which a prototype example is presented.) The last part of the course
concentrates on the case of a string, and particularly on the stationary
(centrifugally supported) configurations known as vortons, which, if they are
sufficiently stable, may be of considerable cosmological significance.
