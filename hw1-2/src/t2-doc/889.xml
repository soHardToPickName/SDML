Nonperturbative Solution of the Super-Virasoro Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the solution of the discrete super-Virasoro constraints to all
orders of the genus expansion. Integrating over the fermionic variables we get
a representation of the partition function in terms of the one-matrix model. We
also obtain the nonperturbative solution of the super-Virasoro constraints in
the double scaling limit but do not find agreement between our flows and the
known supersymmetric extensions of KdV.
