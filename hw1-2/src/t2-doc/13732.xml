String-Membrane Duality in Seven Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The conjectured equivalence of the heterotic string to a $K_3$ compactified
type IIA superstring is combined with the conjectured equivalence of the latter
to a compactified 11-dimensional supermembrane to derive a string membrane
duality in seven dimensions; the membrane is a soliton of the string theory and
vice versa. A prediction of this duality is that the heterotic string is a
$K_3$ compactification of the solitonic 11-dimensional fivebrane. It is
verified that the worldsheet action of the D=10 heterotic string is indeed
obtainable by $K_3$ compactification of the worldvolume action of the
11-dimensional fivebrane, and it is suggested how the worldvolume action of the
D=11 supermebrane may be similarly obtained by $T^3$ compactification of the
worldvolume action of a D=10 heterotic fivebrane. Generalizations to $D=8$
string-threebrane and membrane-membrane duality are also discussed.
