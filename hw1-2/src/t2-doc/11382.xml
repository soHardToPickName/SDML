Cosmological Particle Creation and Dynamical Casimir Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we have considered the particle creation in the spatially
closed Robertson-Walker space-time. We considered a real massive scalar field
which conformally coupled to the Robertson-Walker background. With the
dependence of the scale factor on time, the case under consideration is a
dynamical Casimir effect with moving boundaries.
