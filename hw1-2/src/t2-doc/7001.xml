Homologically Twisted Invariants Related to (2+1)- and (3+1)-Dimensional
  State-Sum Topological Quantum Field Theories

  Motivated by suggestions of Paolo Cotta-Ramusino's work at the physical level
of rigor relating BF theory to the Donaldson polynomials, we provide a
construction applicable to the Turaev/Viro and Crane/Yetter invariants of *a
priori* finer invariants dependent on a choice of (co)homology class on the
manifold
