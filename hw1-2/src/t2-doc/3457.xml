On symmetries of Chern-Simons and BF topological theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe constructing solutions of the field equations of Chern-Simons
and topological BF theories in terms of deformation theory of locally constant
(flat) bundles. Maps of flat connections into one another (dressing
transformations) are considered. A method of calculating (nonlocal) dressing
symmetries in Chern-Simons and topological BF theories is formulated.
