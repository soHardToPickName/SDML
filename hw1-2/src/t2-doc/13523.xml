Axion-Dilatonic Conformal Anomaly from Ads/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss general multidimensional axion-dilatonic AdS gravity which may
correspond to bosonic sector of Gibbons-Green-Perry (compactified) IIB
supergravity with RR-scalar (axion). Using AdS/CFT correspondence the 4d
conformal anomaly on axion-dilaton-gravitational background is found from SG
side. It is shown that for IIB SG with axion such conformal anomaly coincides
with the one obtained from QFT calculation in ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theory conformally coupled with ${\cal N}=4$ conformal SG. Brief discussion on
possibility to apply these results for gauged SGs is also presented.
