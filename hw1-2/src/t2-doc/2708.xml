On the possibility of spinorial quantization in the Skyrme model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the configuration space of the Skyrme model and give a simple
proof that loops generated by full spatial rotations are contractible in the
even-, and non-contractible in the odd-winding-number sectors.
