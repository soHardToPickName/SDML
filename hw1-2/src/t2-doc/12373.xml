Noncommutative relativistic particle
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncommutative version of D-dimensional relativistic particle is proposed. We
consider the particle interacting with the configuration space variable
$\theta^{\mu\nu}(\tau)$ instead of the numerical matrix. The corresponding
Poincare invariant action has a local symmetry, which allows one to impose the
gauge $\theta^{0i}=0, ~ \theta^{ij}=const$. The matrix $\theta^{ij}$ turns out
to be the noncommutativity parameter of the gauge fixed formulation. Poincare
transformations of the gauge fixed formulation are presented in the manifest
form.
