Monopole potential and confining strings in the (2+1)-dimensional
  Georgi-Glashow model
</title>

<abstract>
  Confining strings are investigated in the (2+1)D Georgi-Glashow model. This
is done in the limit when the electric coupling constant is much larger than
the square root of the mass of the Higgs field, but much smaller than the
vacuum expectation value of this field. The modification of the Debye mass of
the dual photon with respect to the case when it is considered to be negligibly
small compared to the Higgs mass, is found. Analogous modifications of the
potential of monopole densities and string coupling constants are found as
well.
