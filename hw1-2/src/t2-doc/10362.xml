A Closed Expression for the Universal R-Matrix in a Non-Standard Quantum
  Double
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent papers of the author, a method was developed for constructing
quasitriangular Hopf algebras (quantum groups) of the quantum-double type. As a
by-product, a novel non-standard example of the quantum double has been found.
In the present paper, a closed expression (in terms of elementary functions)
for the corresponding universal R-matrix is obtained. In reduced form, when the
number of generators becomes two instead of four, this quantum group can be
interpreted as a deformation of the Lie algebra
  [x,h]=2h in the context of Drinfeld's quantization program.
