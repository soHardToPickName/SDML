Nambu-Goto string with massive ends at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the critical (or deconfinement) temperature for the
Nambu-Goto string connecting the point-like masses (quarks) does not depend on
the value of these masses. This temperature turns out to be the same as that in
the case of string with fixed ends (infinitely heavy immobile quarks).
