Solution of Potts-3 and Potts-\infty Matrix Models with the Equations of
  Motion Method
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter, we show how one can solve easily the Potts-3 + branching
interactions and Potts-\infty matrix models, by the means of the equations of
motion (loop equations). We give an algebraic equation for the resolvents of
these models, and their scaling behaviour. This shows that the equations of
motion can be a useful tool for solving such models.
