The Phase of the Scattering Matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  Vacuum polarization in external fields is treated by way of calculating -
exactly and then perturbatively - the phase of the quantum scattering matrix in
the Shale-Stinespring approach to field theory. The link between the
Shale-Stinespring method and the Epstein-Glaser renormalization procedure is
highlighted.
