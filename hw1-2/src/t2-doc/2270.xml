Fermionic Operators from Bosonic Fields in 3+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a construction of fermionic operators in 3+1 dimensions in terms
of bosonic fields in the framework of $QED_4$. The basic bosonic variables are
the electric fields $E_i$ and their conjugate momenta $A_i$. Our construction
generalizes the analogous constuction of fermionic operators in 2+1 dimensions.
Loosely speaking, a fermionic operator is represented as a product of an
operator that creates a pointlike charge and an operator that creates an
infinitesimal t'Hooft loop of half integer strength. We also show how the axial
$U(1)$ transformations are realized in this construction.
