On Curvature-Squared Corrections for D-brane Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  Curvature-squared corrections for D-brane actions in type II string theory
were derived by Bachas, Bain and Green. Here we write down a generalisation of
these corrections to all orders in $F$, the field strength of the U(1) gauge
field on the brane. Some of these terms are needed to restore consistency with
T-duality.
