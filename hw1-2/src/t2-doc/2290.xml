1/4 Partial Breaking of Global Supersymmetry and New Superparticle
  Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the worldline superfield massive superparticle actions which
preserve 1/4 portion of the underlying higher-dimensional supersymmetry. The
rest of supersymmetry is spontaneously broken and realized by nonlinear
transformations. We consider the cases of N=4 to N=1 and N=8 to N=2 partial
breaking. In the first case we present the corresponding Green-Schwarz type
target superspace action with one $\kappa$-supersymmetry. It is related to the
superfield action via a field redefinition. In the second case we find out two
possible models, one of which is a direct generalization of the N=4 to N=1
case, while another is essentially different. For the first model we formulate
Green-Schwarz type action with two kappa supersymmetries. We elaborate on the
bosonic part of the superfield action for the second model and find that only
in two special limits it takes the standard Nambu-Goto form. In the general
case it is determined by a fourth-order algebraic equation. The characteristic
common feature of these new superparticle models is that the algebras of their
spontaneously broken supersymmetries are non-trivial truncations of the general
extensions of N=1 and N=2 Poincare D=4 superalgebras by tensorial central
charges.
