Null Strings and Membranes in Demianski-Newman Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times. Some exact
solutions of the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the
null string and the null membrane in Demianski-Newman background are found.
