Scattering in Anti-de Sitter Space and Operator Product Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a formalism to evaluate generic scalar exchange diagrams in
AdS_{d+1} relevant for the calculation of four-point functions in AdS/CFT
correspondence. The result may be written as an infinite power series of
functions of cross-ratios. Logarithmic singularities appear in all orders
whenever the dimensions of involved operators satisfy certain relations. We
show that the AdS_{d+1} amplitude can be written in a form recognisable as the
conformal partial wave expansion of a four-point function in CFT_{d} and
identify the spectrum of intermediate operators. We find that, in addition to
the contribution of the scalar operator associated with the exchanged field in
the AdS diagram, there are also contributions of some other operators which may
possibly be identified with two-particle bound states in AdS. The CFT
interpretation also provides a useful way to ``regularize'' the logarithms
appearing in AdS amplitude.
