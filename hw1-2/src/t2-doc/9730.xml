On the Classification of Spatially Homogeneous String Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
A classification of all possible spatially homogeneous 4D string backgrounds
(HSBs) has been obtained by appropriate ramification of the existing nine
Bianchi types of homogeneous 3D spaces. A total of $24^2=576$ HSBs which have
been classified as distinct contains a subclass of 192 which includes all
possible FRW models as well as those in which SO(3) isotropy is attained
asymptotically. A discussion of these results also aims to fascilitate the
identification of HSBs which have already appeared in the literature. The basic
physical perspective of the parameters of classification is outlined together
with certain features relating to deeper aspects of string theory.
