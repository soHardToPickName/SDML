Results in susy field theory from 3-brane probe in F-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Employing Sen's picture of BPS states on a 3-brane probe world volume field
theory in a F-theory background. we determine some selection rules for the
allowed spectrum in massless $N_{f}\leq 4$ SU(2) Seiberg-Witten theory. The
spectrum for any $N_f \leq 4$ is consistent with previous conjectures and
analysis.
