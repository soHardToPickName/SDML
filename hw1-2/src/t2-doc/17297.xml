Wrapped Supermembrane
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian of the wrapping and KK modes of the supermembrane is
identified with the SL(2, Z) symmetric axion-dilaton black hole mass formula.
It means that the supermembrane with KK modes wrapped $m$ times around the
space-time torus of compactified dimensions induces the superpotential breaking
spontaneously N=2 down to N=1 SUSY. The supersymmetry breaking parameter Lambda
is inversely proportional to the area A of the space-time torus around which
the supermembrane wraps. The restoration of supersymmetry as well as
decompactification of higher dimensions of space-time are forbidden by the
requirement of stability of the wrapped supermembrane. This may be an ultimate
reason why supersymmetry is broken in the real world.
