String loop corrections to gauge and Yukawa couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on the recent progress in computing the effective supergravity
action from superstring scattering amplitudes beyond the tree approximation. We
discuss the moduli-dependent string loop corrections to gauge, gravitational
and Yukawa couplings.
