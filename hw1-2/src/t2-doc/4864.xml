The World as a Hologram
</title>

<abstract>
  According to 't Hooft the combination of quantum mechanics and gravity
requires the three dimensional world to be an image of data that can be stored
on a two dimensional projection much like a holographic image. The two
dimensional description only requires one discrete degree of freedom per Planck
area and yet it is rich enough to describe all three dimensional phenomena.
After outlining 't Hooft's proposal I give a preliminary informal description
of how it may be implemented. One finds a basic requirement that particles must
grow in size as their momenta are increased far above the Planck scale. The
consequences for high energy particle collisions are described. The phenomena
of particle growth with momentum was previously discussed in the context of
string theory and was related to information spreading near black hole
horizons. The considerations of this paper indicate that the effect is much
more rapid at all but the earliest times. In fact the rate of spreading is
found to saturate the bound from causality. Finally we consider string theory
as a possible realization of 't Hooft's idea. The light front lattice string
model of Klebanov and Susskind is reviewed and its similarities with the
holographic theory are demonstrated. The agreement between the two requires
unproven but plausible assumptions about the nonperturbative behavior of string
theory. Very similar ideas to those in this paper have been long held by
Charles Thorn.
