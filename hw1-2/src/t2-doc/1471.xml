Reminiscences of Collaborations with Joel Scherk
</title>

<abstract>
  I had the privilege of collaborating with Joel Scherk on three separate
occasions: in 1970 at Princeton, in 1974 at Caltech, and in 1978-79 at the
Ecole Normale Superieure. In this talk I give some reminiscences of these
collaborations.
