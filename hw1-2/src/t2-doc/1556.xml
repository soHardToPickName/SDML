Comment on: ``Trace anomaly of dilaton coupled scalars in two
  dimensions''
</title>

<abstract>
  The trace anomaly for nonminimally coupled scalars in spherically reduced
gravity obtained by Bousso and Hawking (hep-th/9705236) is incorrect. We
explain the reasons for the deviations from our correct (published) result
which is supported by several other recent papers.
