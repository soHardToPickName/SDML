Exact Solutions for Cosmological Models with a Scalar Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the existence of a Noether symmetry in the scalar-tensor theory
of gravity in flat Friedman Robertson Walker (FRW) cosmology. The forms of
coupling function $\omega(\phi)$ and generic potential $V(\phi)$ are obtained
by requiring the existence of a Noether symmetry for such theory. We derive
exact cosmological solutions of the field equations from a point-like
Lagrangian.
