Splitting of an Extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om Throat via Quantum
  Tunneling
</title>

<abstract>
  The interior near the horizon of an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole
is taken as an initial state for quantum mechanical tunneling. An instanton is
presented that connects this state with a final state describing the presence
of several horizons. This is interpreted as a WKB description of fluctuations
due to the throat splitting into several components.
