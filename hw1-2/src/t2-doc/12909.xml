Linearized Gravity in the Karch-Randall Braneworld
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a linearized gravity investigation of the bent braneworld, where
an AdS_4 brane is embedded in AdS_5. While we focus on static spherically
symmetric mass distributions on the brane, much of the analysis continues to
hold for more general configurations. In addition to the identification of the
massive Karch-Randall graviton and a tower of Kaluza-Klein gravitons, we find a
radion mode that couples to the trace of the energy-momentum tensor on the
brane. The Karch-Randall radion arises as a property of the embedding of the
brane in the bulk space, even in the context of a single brane model.
