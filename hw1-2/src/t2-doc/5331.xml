Variational Approach to Quantum Field Theory: Gaussian Approximation and
  the Perturbative Expansion around It
</title>

<abstract>
  The functional Schrodinger picture formulation of quantum field theory and
the variational Gaussian approximation method based on the formulation are
briefly reviewed. After presenting recent attempts to improve the variational
approximation, we introduce a new systematic method based on the background
field method, which enables one to compute the order-by-order correction terms
to the Gaussian approximation of the effective action.
