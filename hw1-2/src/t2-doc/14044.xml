Noncommutative Dymanics

<abstract>
  We propose a new wiew on the structure of quantum mechanics and postulate a
q-deformed algebra of observables. We find equations of motion for this system,
which guarantee a unitary time developement. We solve this equations for simple
models. We write this formalism in terms of twisted deRham complex.
