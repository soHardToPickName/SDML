Dynkin Diagrams of ${CP}^1$ Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate $N=2$ supersymmetric sigma model orbifolds of the sphere in
the large radius limit. These correspond to $N=2$ superconformal field
theories. Using the equations of topological-anti-topological fusion for the
topological orbifold, we compute the generalized Dynkin diagrams of these
theories - i.e., the soliton spectrum - which was used in the classification of
massive superconformal theories. They correspond to the extended Dynkin
diagrams associated to finite subgroups of $SO(3).$
