Constraints on Higher Derivative Operators in Maximally Supersymmetric
  Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the work of Dine and Seiberg for SU(2), we study the leading
irrelevant operators on the moduli space of N=4 supersymmetric SU(N) gauge
theory. These operators are argued to be one-loop exact, and are explicitly
computed.
