Fermionic zero-modes in type II fivebrane backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  The explicit form of the fermionic zero-modes in the fivebrane backgrounds of
type IIA and IIB supergravity theories is investigated. In type IIA fivebrane
background there are four zero-modes of gravitinos and dilatinos. In type IIB
fivebrane background four zero-modes of dilatinos and no zero-modes of
gravitinos are found. These zero-modes indicate the four-fermion condensates
which have been suggested in a calculation of the tension of the D-brane in
fivebrane backgrounds.
