A c=-2 boundary changing operator for the Abelian sandpile
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the unoriented two-dimensional Abelian sandpile model on the
half-plane with open and closed boundary conditions. We show that the operator
effecting the change from closed to open, or from open to closed, is a boundary
primary field of weight -1/8, belonging to a c=-2 logarithmic conformal field
theory.
