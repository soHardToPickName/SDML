Minimum Uncertainty, Coherence and Squeezing in Diffusion Processes, and
  Stochastic Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that uncertainty relations, as well as minimum uncertainty coherent
and squeezed states, are structural properties for diffusion processes. Through
Nelson stochastic quantization we derive the stochastic image of the quantum
mechanical coherent and squeezed states.
