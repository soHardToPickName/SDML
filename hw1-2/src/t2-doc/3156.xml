Self-Dual Chern-Simons Solitons with Non-Compact Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to couple non-relativistic matter with a Chern--Simons gauge
field that belongs to a non-compact group. We treat in some details the
$SL(2,{\bf R})$ and the Poincar\'e $ISO(2,1)$ groups. For suitable
self-interactions, we are able to exhibit soliton solutions.
