Decoupling of Zero-Modes and Covariance in the Light-Front Formulation
  of Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show under suitable assumptions that zero-modes decouple from the dynamics
of non-zero modes in the light-front formulation of some supersymmetric field
theories. The implications for Lorentz invariance are discussed.
