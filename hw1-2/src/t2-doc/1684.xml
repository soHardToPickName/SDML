Supersymmetric gauge theories in the exact renormalization group
  approach
</title>

<abstract>
  In these notes the exact renormalization group formulation of the scalar
theory is briefly reviewed. This regularization scheme is then applied to
supersymmetric theories. In case of a supersymmetric gauge theory it is also
shown how to recover gauge invariance, broken by the introduction of the
infrared cutoff.
