Unravelling the On-shell Constraints of Self-dual Supergravity Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a construction, using the harmonic space method, of solutions to
the superfield equations of motion for N-extended self-dual supergravity
theories. A superspace gauge condition suitable for the performance of a
component analysis is discussed.
