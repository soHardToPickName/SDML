Self-dual Chern-Simons solitons in noncommutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct exact soliton solutions to the Chern-Simons-Higgs system in
noncommutative space, for non-relativistic and relativistic models. In both
cases we find regular vortex-like solutions to the BPS equations which approach
the ordinary selfdual non-topological and topological solitons when the
noncommutative parameter $\theta$ goes to zero.
