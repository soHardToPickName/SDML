Nonperturbative Model Of Liouville Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain nonperturbative results in the framework of continuous Liouville
theory. In particular, we express the specific heat ${\cal Z}$ of pure gravity
in terms of an expansion of integrals on moduli spaces of punctured Riemann
spheres. The integrands are written in terms of the Liouville action. We show
that ${\cal Z}$ satisfies the Painlev\'e I.
