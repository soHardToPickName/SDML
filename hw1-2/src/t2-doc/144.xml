Towards testing the Maldacena Conjecture with SDLCQ
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Maldacena conjecture applied to the near horizon geometry of
a D1-brane in the supergravity approximation and present numerical results of a
test of the conjecture against the boundary field theory calculation using
supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ). We present numerical
results with approximately 1000 times as many states as we previously
considered. These results support the Maldacena conjecture and are within
10-15% of the predicted numerical results in some regions. Our results are
still not sufficient to demonstrate convergence, and, therefore, cannot be
considered to a numerical proof of the conjecture. We present a method for
using a ``flavor'' symmetry to greatly reduce the size of the basis and discuss
a numerical method that we use which is particularly well suited for this type
of matrix element calculation.
