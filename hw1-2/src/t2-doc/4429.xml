Application of finite field-dependent BRS transformations to problems of
  the Coulomb gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Coulomb propagator in the formalism developed recently in
which we construct the Coulomb gauge path-integral by correlating it with the
well-defined Lorentz gauge path-integrals through a finite field-dependent BRS
transformation. We discover several features of the Coulomb gauge from it. We
find that the singular Coulomb gauge HAS to be treated as the gauge parameter
lambda --> 0 limit. We further find that the propagator so obtained has good
high energy behavior (k_0^{-2}) for lambda and epsilon nonzero. We further find
that the behavior of the propagator so obtained is sensitive to the order of
limits k_0 -->infinity, lambda -->0 and epsilon --> 0; so that these have to be
handled carefully in a higher loop calculation. We show that we can arrive at
the result of Cheng and Tsai for the ambiguous two loop Feynman integrals
without the need for an extra ad hoc regularization and within the path
integral formulation.
