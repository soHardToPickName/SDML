Black Holes and Quantum Predictability
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief review of the confrontation between black hole physics and
quantum-mechanical unitarity is presented. Possibile reconciliations are
modifying the laws of physics to allow fundamental loss of information, escape
of information during the Hawking process, or black hole remnants. Each of
these faces serious objections. A better understanding of the problem and its
possible solutions can be had by studying two-dimensional models of dilaton
gravity. Recent developments in these investigations are summarized. (Linear
superposition of talks presented at the 7th Nishinomiya Yukawa Memorial
Symposium and at the 1992 YITP Workshop on Quantum Gravity, November 1992.)
