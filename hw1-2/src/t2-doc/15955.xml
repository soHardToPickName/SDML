Conformal Field Theory Techniques in Random Matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  In these notes we explain how the CFT description of random matrix models can
be used to perform actual calculations. Our basic example is the hermitian
matrix model, reformulated as a conformal invariant theory of free fermions. We
give an explicit operator construction of the corresponding collective field
theory in terms of a bosonic field on a hyperelliptic Riemann surface, with
special operators associated with the branch points. The quasiclassical
expressions for the spectral kernel and the joint eigenvalue probabilities are
then easily obtained as correlation functions of current, fermionic and twist
operators. The result for the spectral kernel is valid both in macroscopic and
microscopic scales. At the end we briefly consider generalizations in different
directions.
