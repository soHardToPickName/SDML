Quantization of Gauge Field Theories on the Front-Form without Gauge
  Constraints I : The Abelian Case
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, we have proposed a new front-form quantization which treated both
the $x^{+}$ and the $x^{-}$ coordinates as front-form 'times.' This
quantization was found to preserve parity explicitly. In this paper we extend
this construction to local Abelian gauge fields . We quantize this theory using
a method proposed originally by Faddeev and Jackiw . We emphasize here the
feature that quantizing along both $x^+$ and $x^-$ , gauge theories does not
require extra constraints (also known as 'gauge conditions') to determine the
solution uniquely.
