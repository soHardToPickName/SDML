Supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that three-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons
theory is finite to all loops. This leaves open the possibility that different
regularization methods give different finite effective actions. We show that
for this model dimensional regularization and regularization by dimensional
reduction yield the same effective action.
