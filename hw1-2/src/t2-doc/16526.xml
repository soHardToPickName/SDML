Critical O(N) - vector nonlinear sigma - models: A resume of their field
  structure
</title>

<abstract>
  The classification of quasi - primary fields is outlined. It is proved that
the only conserved quasi - primary currents are the energy - momentum tensor
and the O(N) - Noether currents. Derivation of all quasi - primary fields and
the resolution of degeneracy is sketched. Finally the limits d=2 and d=4 of the
space dimension are discussed. Whereas the latter is trivial the former is only
almost so.
