Semiclassical Quantization of Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantization of the dilaton gravity in two dimensions is discussed by a
semiclassical approximation. We compute the fixed-area partition function to
one-loop order and obtain the string susceptibility on Riemann surfaces of
arbitrary genus. Our result is consistent with the approach using techniques of
conformal field theories.
