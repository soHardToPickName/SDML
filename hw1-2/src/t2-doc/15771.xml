The Low-level Spectrum of the $W_3$ String
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the spectrum of physical states in the $W_3$ string theory, up
to level 2 for a multi-scalar string, and up to level 4 for the two-scalar
string. The (open) $W_3$ string has a photon as its only massless state. By
using screening charges to study the null physical states in the two-scalar
$W_3$ string, we are able to learn about the gauge symmetries of the states in
the multi-scalar $W_3$ string.
