A Continuum Approach to 2D-Quantum Gravity for C>1
</title>

<abstract>
  A Lagrangian continuum model for a string theory with central charge $c>1$ is
formulated by incorporating Weyl and diffeomorphism gauge fixing. In particular
the tachyon scattering amplitudes are deduced generalizing the standard $c\le
1$ computation.
