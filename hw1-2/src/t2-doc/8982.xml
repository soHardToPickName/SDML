Three point functions of N=4 Super Yang Mills from light cone string
  field theory in pp-wave

  In this paper we calculate three-string interaction from light cone string
field theory in pp-wave. We find exact agreements with the free planar three
point functions of non-chiral BMN operators of ${\cal N} = 4$ super Yang Mills.
The three string interaction vertex involving the Neumann matrices was derived
in a recent paper hep-th/0204146. We explicitly calculate the bosonic Neumann
matrices in the limit of large $\mu p^{+} \alpha^{'}$ . Using the Neumann
matrices we are able to compute the cubic interactions of three string modes in
a pp-wave background.
