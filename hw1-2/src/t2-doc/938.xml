Perturbative Calculation of Multi-Loop Feynman Diagrams. New Type of
  Expansions for Critical Exponents
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the calculation of L-loop Feynman integrals in D dimensions can
be reduced to a series of matrix multiplications in D times L dimensions. This
gives rise to a new type of expansions for the critical exponents in three
dimensions in which all coefficients can be calculated exactly.
