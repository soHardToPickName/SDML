On the existence of minima in the Skyrme model
</title>

<abstract>
  Well-separated Skyrme solitons of arbitrary degree attract after a suitable
relative rotation in space and iso-space, provided the orders of the solitons'
leading multipoles do not differ by more than two. I summarise the derivation
of this result, obtained jointly with Manton and Singer, and discuss to what
extent its combination with earlier results of Esteban allows one to deduce the
existence of minima of the Skyrme energy functional.
