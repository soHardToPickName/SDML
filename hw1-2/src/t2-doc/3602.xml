Simple Brane World Scenario with Positive Five Dimensional Cosmological
  Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple brane-world model in five dimensions. In this model we do
not need any fine-tuning between the five dimensional cosmological constant and
the brane tension to obtain four dimensional flat Minkowski space. The
space-time of our solution has no naked singularities. Further the
compactification scale of the fifth direction is automatically determined.
