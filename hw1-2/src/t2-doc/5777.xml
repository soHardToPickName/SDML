Antibranes and crossing symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Crossing symmetry appears in Dbrane-anti-Dbrane dynamics in the form of an
analytic continuation from U(N) for N brane amplitudes to U(N-p,p) for the
interactions of N-p branes with p anti-branes. I consider the consequences for
supersymmetry and brane-anti-brane forces.
