  We discuss Coleman's theorem concerning the energy density of the ground
state of the sine-Gordon model proved in Phys. Rev. D 11, 2088 (1975).
According to this theorem the energy density of the ground state of the
sine-Gordon model should be unbounded from below for coupling constants beta^2
> 8 pi. The consequence of this theorem would be the non-existence of the
quantum ground state of the sine-Gordon model for beta^2 > 8 pi. We show that
the energy density of the ground state in the sine-Gordon model is bounded from
below even for beta^2 > 8 pi.
