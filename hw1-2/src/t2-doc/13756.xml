Physical Aspects of Differential Calculi on Commutative Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The central structure in various versions of noncommutative geometry is a
differential calculus on an associative algebra. This is an analogue of the
calculus of differential forms on a manifold. In this short review we collect
examples of differential calculi on commutative algebras (which can be regarded
as algebras of functions on some topological space). We explain how these are
related to relevant structures in physics.
