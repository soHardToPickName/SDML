Chiral fermion action with (8,0) worldsheet supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an action describing chiral fermions with an arbitrary gauge group
and with manifest $(8,0)$ worldsheet supersymmetry. The form of the action is
inspired by and adapted for completing the twistor-like formulation of the
$D=10$ heterotic superstring.
