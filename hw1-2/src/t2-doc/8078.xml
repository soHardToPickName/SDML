On a `universal' class of WZW-type conformal models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of sigma models that appears from a generalisation of the
gauged WZW model parametrised by a constant matrix $Q$. Particular values of
$Q$ correspond to the standard gauged WZW models, chiral gauged WZW models and
a bosonised version of the non-abelian Thirring model. The condition of
conformal invariance of the models (to one loop or $1/k$-order but exactly in
$Q$) is derived and is represented as an algebraic equation on $Q$. Solving
this equation we demonstrate explicitly the conformal invariance of the sigma
models associated with arbitrary $G/H$ gauged and chiral gauged WZW theories as
well as of the models that can be represented as WZW model perturbed by
integrably marginal operators (constructed from currents of the Cartan
subalgebra $H_c$ of $G$). The latter models can be also interpreted as $G x
H/H$ gauged WZW models and have the corresponding target space couplings
(metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton) depending on an arbitrary constant
matrix which parametrises an embedding of the abelian subgroup $H$ (isomorphic
to $H_c$) into $G x H$. We discuss the relation of our conformal invariance
equation to the large $k$ form of the master equation of the affine-Virasoro
construction. Our equation describes `reducible' versions of some `irreducible'
solutions (cosets) of the master equation. We suggest a classically
non-Lorentz-invariant sigma model that may correspond to other solutions of the
master equation.
