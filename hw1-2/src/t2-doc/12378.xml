Amalgamated Codazzi Raychaudhuri identity for foliation
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how a pure background tensor formalism provides a concise but
explicit and highly flexible machinery for the generalised curvature analysis
of individual embedded surfaces and foliations such as arise in the theory of
topological defects in cosmological and other physical contexts. The unified
treatment provided here shows how the relevant extension of the Raychaudhuri
identity is related to the correspondingly extended Codazzi identity.
