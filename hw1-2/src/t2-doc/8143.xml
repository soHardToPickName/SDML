Spectral asymmetry and supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Fractional charges, and in particular the spectral asymmetry eta of certain
Dirac operators, can appear in the central charge of supersymmetric field
theories. This yields unexpected analyticity constraints on eta from which
classic results can be recovered in an elegant way. The method could also be
applied in the context of string theory.
