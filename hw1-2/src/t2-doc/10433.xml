Half-String Approach to Closed String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we present an operator formalism for Closed String Field
Theory based on closed half-strings. Our results indicate that the restricted
polyhedra of the classical non-polynomial string field theory, can be
represented as traces of infinite matrices, with operator insertions that
reparametrise the half-strings.
