Nonlinear Sigma Models in (1+2)-Dimensions and An Infinite Number of
  Conserved Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  We treat in this paper non-linear sigma models such as $CP^1$-model,
$QP^1$-model and etc, in 1+2 dimensions. For submodels of such ones we
definitely construct an infinite number of nontrivial conserved currents. Our
result is a generalization of that of authors (Alvarez, Ferreira and Guillen).
