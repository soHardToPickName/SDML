<abstract>
  This is a brief introduction on the graduate level to mechanics of various
spin relativistic particles with oscillatorlike interaction. This mathematical
model proposed by M. Moshinsky could have considerable physical applications
for describing processes mediated by tensor fields and in bound state theory.
