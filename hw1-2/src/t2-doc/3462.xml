Duality and Topological Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a summary of the applications of duality to Donaldson-Witten
theory and its generalizations. Special emphasis is made on the computation of
Donaldson invariants in terms of Seiberg-Witten invariants using recent results
in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory. A brief account on the invariants obtained
in the theory of non-abelian monopoles is also presented.
