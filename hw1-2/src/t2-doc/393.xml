Black hole solutions with dilatonic hair in higher curvature gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A new numerical integration method for examining a black hole structure was
realized. Black hole solutions with dilatonic hair of 4D low energy effective
SuperString Theory action with Gauss-Bonnet quadratic curvature contribution
were studied, using this method, inside and outside the event horizon.
Thermodynamical properties of this solution were also studied.
