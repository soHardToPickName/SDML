Knot Theory from a Chern-Simons Gauge Theory Point of View
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief summary of the development of perturbative Chern-Simons gauge theory
related to the theory of knots and links is presented. Emphasis is made on the
progress achieved towards the determination of a general combinatorial
expression for Vassiliev invariants. Its form for all the invariants up to
order four is reviewed, and a table of their values for all prime knots with
ten crossings is presented.
