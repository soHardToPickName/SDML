Entropy Count for Extremal Three-Dimensional Black Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the entropy of extremal black strings in three dimensions, using
Strominger's approach to relate the Anti-de-Sitter near-horizon geometry and
the conformal field theory at the asymptotic infinity of this geometry. The
result is identical to the geometric Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We further
discuss an embedding of three-dimensional black strings in $N=1 D=10$
supergravity and demonstrate that the extremal strings preserve 1/4 of
supersymmetries.
