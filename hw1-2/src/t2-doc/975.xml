D-branes on Calabi-Yau Manifolds and Superpotentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to compute terms in an expansion of the world-volume
superpotential for fairly general D-branes on the quintic Calabi-Yau using
linear sigma model techniques, and show in examples that this superpotential
captures the geometry and obstruction theory of bundles and sheaves on this
Calabi-Yau.
