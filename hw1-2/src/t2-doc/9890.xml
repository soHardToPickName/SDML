An extended fuzzy supersphere and twisted chiral superfields
</title>

<abstract>
  A noncommutative associative algebra of N=2 fuzzy supersphere is introduced.
It turns out to possess a nontrivial automorphism which relates twisted chiral
to twisted anti-chiral superfields and hence makes possible to construct
noncommutative nonlinear $\si$-models with extended supersymmetry.
