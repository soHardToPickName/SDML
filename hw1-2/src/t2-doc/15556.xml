Symplectic embedding and Hamilton-Jacobi analysis of Proca model
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the symplectic approach we show how to embed the Abelian Proca
model into a first-class system by extending the configuration space to include
an additional pair of scalar fields, and compare it with the improved Dirac
scheme. We obtain in this way the desired Wess-Zumino and gauge fixing terms of
BRST invariant Lagrangian. Furthermore, the integrability properties of the
second-class system described by the Abelian Proca model are investigated using
the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, where we construct the closed Lie algebra by
introducing operators associated with the generalized Poisson brackets.
