The periodic table of static fermion bags in the Gross-Neveu Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectrum of stable static fermion bags in the 1+1 dimensional
Gross-Neveu model with $N$ flavors of Dirac fermions, in the large $N$ limit.
In the process, we discover a new kink, heavier than the
Callan-Coleman-Gross-Zee (CCGZ) kink, which is marginally stable (at least in
the large $N$ limit). The connection of this new kink and the conjectured $S$
matrix of the Gross-Neveu model is obscured at this point. After identifying
all stable static fermion bags, we arrange them into a periodic table,
according to their $O (2N)$ and topological quantum numbers.
