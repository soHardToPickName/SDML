(Super)conformal many-body quantum mechanics with extended supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study N=4 supersymmetric quantum-mechanical many-body systems with M
bosonic and 4M fermionic degrees of freedom. We also investigate the further
restrictions of conformal and superconformal invariance. In particular, we
construct conformal N=4 extensions of the A_{M-1} Calogero models, which for
generic values of the coupling constant are not SU(1,1|2) superconformal. This
class of models is also extended to arbitrary (even) N. We give both
hamiltonian and (classical) lagrangean formulations. In the latter case we use
both component and N=4 superfield formulations.
