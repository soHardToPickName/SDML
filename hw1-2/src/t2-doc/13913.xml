Nonperturbative Dynamics of Noncommutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a nonperturbative lattice formulation of noncommutative Yang-Mills
theories in arbitrary even dimension. We show that lattice regularization of a
noncommutative field theory requires finite lattice volume which automatically
provides both an ultraviolet and an infrared cutoff. We demonstrate explicitly
Morita equivalence of commutative U(p) gauge theory with (p*n_f) flavours of
fundamental matter fields on a lattice of size L with twisted boundary
conditions and noncommutative U(1) gauge theory with n_f species of matter on a
lattice of size (p*L) with single-valued fields. We discuss the relation with
twisted large N reduced models and construct observables in noncommutative
gauge theory with matter.
