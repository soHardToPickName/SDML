Photon splitting and photon-plasmon interaction in a dense medium
</title>

<abstract>
  Three-photon vertex in a dense degenerated plasma is calculated. It is
discovered the polarization tensor has the longitudinal part which makes
possible an interaction between transverse and longitudinal modes in the
medium. Using dispersion relations it is shown that the only kinematically
permitted type of the photon splitting is the decay of the transverse photon to
two plasmons.
