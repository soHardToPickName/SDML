A Mean Field Approximation to the Worldsheet Model of Planar phi^3 Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop an approximation scheme for our worldsheet model of the sum of
planar diagrams based on mean field theory. At finite coupling the mean field
equations show a weak coupling solution that resembles the perturbative
diagrams and a strong coupling solution that seems to represent a tensionless
soup of field quanta. With a certain amount of fine-tuning, we find a solution
of the mean field equations that seems to support string formation.
