Dirichlet Branes on Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  The D-brane spectrum of a class of $\Zop_2$ orbifolds of toroidally
compactified Type IIA and Type IIB string theory is analysed systematically.
The corresponding K-theory groups are determined and complete agreement is
found. The charge densities of the various branes are also calculated.
