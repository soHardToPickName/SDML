To see a world in a grain of sand
</title>

<abstract>
  Throughout John Wheeler's career, he wrestled with big issues like the
fundamental length, the black hole and the unification of quantum mechanics and
relativity. In this essay, I argue that solid state physics -- historically the
study of silicon, semiconductors and sand grains -- can give surprisingly deep
insights into the big questions of the world.
