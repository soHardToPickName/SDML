Four Lectures on M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Synopsis: (i) how superstring theories are unified by M-theory; (ii) how
superstring and supermembrane properties follow from the D=10 and D=11
supersymmetry algebras; (iii) how D=10 and D=11 supergravity theories determine
the strong coupling limit of superstring theories; (iv) how properties of Type
II p-branes follow from those of M-branes.
