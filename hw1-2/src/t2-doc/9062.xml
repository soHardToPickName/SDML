Superdiffeomorphisms of the Topological Yang-Mills and Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the superdiffeomorphisms transformations of the four-dimensional
topological Yang-Mills theory in curved manifold and we discuss the ultraviolet
renormalization of the model. The explicit expression of the most general
counterterm is given.
