Fuzzy Algebrae of the General Kaehler Coset Space G/H\otimesU(1)^k
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the fuzzy structure of the general Kaehler coset space
G/S\otimes{U(1)}^k deformed by the Fedosov formalism. It is shown that the
Killing potentials satisfy the fuzzy algebrae working in the Darboux
coordinates.
