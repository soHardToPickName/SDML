Comments on the Moduli Dynamics of 1/4 BPS Dyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We rederive the nonrelativistic Lagrangian for the low energy dynamics of 1/4
BPS dyons by considering the time dependent fluctuations around classical 1/4
BPS configurations. The relevant fluctuations are the zero modes of the
underlying 1/2 BPS monopoles.
