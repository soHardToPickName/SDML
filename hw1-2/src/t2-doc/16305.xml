Exact Multiplicities in the Three-Anyon Spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the symmetry properties of the three-anyon spectrum, we obtain exactly
the multiplicities of states with given energy and angular momentum. The
results are shown to be in agreement with the proper quantum mechanical and
semiclassical considerations, and the unexplained points are indicated.
