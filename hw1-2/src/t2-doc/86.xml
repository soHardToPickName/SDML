Renormalization in Quantum Statistics of Systems with Spontaneous
  Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  Renormalization in quantum statistics in the presence of a charge associated
to a spontaneously broken symmetry is discussed for the scalar field model. In
contrast to the case of non-broken symmetry, the renormalization mass
counterterm depends on the chemical potential. We argue that this is connected
to the ill-defined character of the charge operator.
