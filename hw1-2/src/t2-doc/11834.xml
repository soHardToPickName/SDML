Universality of the universal R-matrix and applications to quantum
  integrable systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Results obtained by us are overviewed from a general set up. The universal
$R$-matrix is exploited to obtain various important relations and structures
involved in quantum group algebra, which are used subsequently for generating
different classes of quantum integrable systems through a systematic scheme.
This recovers known models as well as discovers a series of new ones.
