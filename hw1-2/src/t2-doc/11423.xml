Leading Log Corrections to Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy associated with any black hole
undergoes logarithmic corrections when small thermodynamic fluctuations around
equilibrium are taken into account. Thus, the corrected expression for black
hole entropy is given by $S= A/4 - k \ln(A)$, where $A$ is the horizon area and
$k$ is a constant which depends on the specific black hole. We apply our result
to BTZ black hole, for which $k=3/2$, as found earlier, as well as to anti-de
Sitter-Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black hole in arbitrary spacetime
dimensions. Finally, we examine the role of conformal field theory in black
hole entropy and its corrections.
