Non-Supersymmetric SO(3)-Invariant Deformations of N=1* Vacua and their
  Dual String Theory Description
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the SO(3)-invariant relevant deformations of N=4 SU(N) gauge theory
using the methods of Polchinski and Strassler. We present the region of
parameter space where the non-supersymmetric vacuum is still described by
stable ``dielectric'' five branes within the supergravity approximation.
