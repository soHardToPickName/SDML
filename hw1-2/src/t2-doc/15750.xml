String representation of SU(3) gluodynamics in the abelian projection
</title>

<abstract>
  A dual Ginzburg-Landau model corresponding to SU(3) gluodynamics in abelian
projection is studied. A string theory describing QCD string dynamics is
obtained in this model. The interaction of static quarks in mesons and baryons
is investigated in an approximation to leading order.
