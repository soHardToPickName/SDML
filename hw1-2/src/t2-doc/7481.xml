Path Integral for the Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  A c-number path integral representation is constructed for the solution of
the Dirac equation. The integration is over the real trajectories in the
continuous three-space and other two canonical pairs of compact variables
controlling the spin and the chirality flips.
