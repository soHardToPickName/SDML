Unitary Matrix Models and Phase Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the unitary matrix model with a topological term. We call the
topological term the theta term. In the symmetric model there is the phase
transition between the strong and weak coupling regime at $\lambda_{c}=2$. If
the Wilson term is bigger than the theta term, there is the strong-weak
coupling phase transition at the same $\lambda_{c}$. On the other hand, if the
theta term is bigger than the Wilson term, there is only the strong coupling
regime. So the topological phase transition disappears in this case.
