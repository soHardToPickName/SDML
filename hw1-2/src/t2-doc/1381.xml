Brane Configurations for Three-dimensional Nonabelian Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study brane configurations corresponding to D-branes on complex
three-dimensional orbifolds ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma=\Delta(3n^2)$ and
$\Delta(6n^2)$, nonabelian finite subgroups of SU(3). We first construct a
brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$ by using
D3-branes and a web of (p,q) 5-branes of type IIB string theory. Brane
configurations for the nonabelian orbifolds are obtained by performing certain
quotients on the configuration for ${\bf C}^3/{\bf Z}_n \times {\bf Z}_n$.
Structure of the quiver diagrams of the groups $\Delta(3n^2)$ and
$\Delta(6n^2)$ can be reproduced from the brane configurations. We point out
that the brane configuration for ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ can be regarded as a
physical realization of the quiver diagram of $\Gamma$. Based on this
observation, we discuss that three-dimensional McKay correspondence may be
interpreted as T-duality.
