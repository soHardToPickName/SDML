Fate of the Born-Infeld solution in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the
 Born-Infeld solution on the D$9-$brane is unstable under inclusion of
derivative corrections to Born-Infeld theory coming from string theory. More
specifically, we find no electrostatic solutions to the first order corrected
Born-Infeld theory on the D$9-$brane which give a finite value for the
Lagrangian.
