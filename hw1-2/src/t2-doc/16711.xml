Odd Bihamiltonian Structure of New Supersymmetric N=2,4 KdV And Odd SUSY
  Virasoro - Like Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The general method of the supersymmetrization of the soliton equations with
the odd (bi) hamiltonian structure is established. New version of the
supersymmetric N=2,4 (Modified) Korteweg de Vries equation is given, as an
example. The second odd Hamiltonian operator of the SUSY KdV equation generates
the odd N=2,4 SUSY Virasoro - like algebra.
