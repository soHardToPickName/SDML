Loop dynamics and AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the strong coupling limit of conformal gauge theories in 4
dimensions. The action of the loop operator on the minimal area in the AdS
space is analyzed, and the Schwinger-Dyson equations of gauge theory are
checked. The general approach to the loop dynamics developed here goes beyond
the special case of conformal theories.
