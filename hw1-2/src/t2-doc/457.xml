Interactions in Abelian and Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a natural way to study the long distance interactions of gauge
theories in the electric (momentum) representation. Here, the main ideas are
presented for the Abelian and Yang-Mills gauge theories emphasizing on the
structure and the advantages of this approach.
