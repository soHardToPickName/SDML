Holographic Stress Tensor for Kerr-AdS Black Holes and Local Failure on
  IR-UV Connection
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in general holographic stress tensor may contain a new term of
divergence of a spacelike unit normal acceleration. Then, it is shown that in
contrast to previous descriptions, a new stress tensor for Kerr-AdS solutions
can be a traceless one. Interestingly, this prescription entails a local
failure on the IR-UV connection.
