Generalized Gaussian Effective Potential: Low Dimensional Scalar Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a generalization of the Gaussian effective potential for
self-interacting scalar fields in one and two spatial dimensions. We compute
the two-loop corrections and discuss the renormalization of the generalized
Gaussian effective potential.
