The Lax pair for C_2-type Ruijsenaars-Schneider model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the C_2 Ruijsenaars-Schneider(RS) model with interaction potential
of trigonometric type. The Lax pairs for the model with and without spectral
parameter are constructed. Also given are the involutive Hamiltonians for the
system. Taking nonrelativistic limit, we obtain the Lax pair of C_2
Calogero-Moser model.
