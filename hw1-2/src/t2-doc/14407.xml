Zero modes of the Dirac operator in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate zero modes of the Dirac operator coupled to an Abelian gauge
field in three dimensions. We find that the existence of a certain class of
zero modes is related to a specific topological property precisely when the
requirement of finite Chern--Simons action is imposed.
