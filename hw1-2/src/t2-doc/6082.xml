Exceptional SW Geometry from ALE Fibrations
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the genus 34 Seiberg-Witten curve underlying $N=2$ Yang-Mills
theory with gauge group $E_6$ yields physically equivalent results to the
manifold obtained by fibration of the $E_6$ ALE singularity. This reconciles a
puzzle raised by $N=2$ string duality.
