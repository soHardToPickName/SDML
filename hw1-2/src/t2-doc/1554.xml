Statistical Mechanics of Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the statistical mechanics of a two-dimensional gas of non-Abelian
Chern-Simons particles which obey the non-Abelian braid statistics. The second
virial coefficient is evaluated in the framework of the non-Abelian
Chern-Simons quantum mechanics.
