Interpretation of High Energy String Scattering in terms of String
  Configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  High energy string scattering at fixed momentum transfer, known to be
dominated by Regge trajectory exchange, is interpreted by identifying families
of string states which induce each type of trajectory exchange. These include
the usual leading trajectory $\alpha(t)=\alpha^\prime t+1$ and its daughters as
well as the ``sister'' trajectories $\alpha_m(t)=\alpha(t)/m-(m-1)/2$ and their
daughters. The contribution of the sister $\alpha_m$ to high energy scattering
is dominated by string excitations in the $m^{th}$ mode. Thus, at large $-t$,
string scattering is dominated by wee partons, consistently with a picture of
string as an infinitely composite system of ``constituents'' which carry zero
energy and momentum.
