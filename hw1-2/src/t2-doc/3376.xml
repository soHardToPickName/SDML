A Two Parameter Family of the Calabi-Yau d-Fold
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a two parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold by means of mirror
symmetry. We construct mirror maps and calculate correlation functions
associated with {\kae} moduli in the original manifold. We find there are more
complicated instanton corrections of these couplings than threefolds, which is
expected to reflect families of instantons with continous parameters.
