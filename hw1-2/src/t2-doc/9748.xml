Lorentz Covariance in Epstein-Glaser Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We give explicit and inductive formulas for the construction of a Lorentz
covariant renormalization in the EG approach. This automatically provides for a
covariant BPHZ subtraction at totally spacelike momentum useful for massless
theories.
