BF Theory On A Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  An alternative approach to introducing gravitational dynamics on a brane
embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime is presented. The brane is treated
as a boundary of a higher dimensional manifold in which the bulk action is
described by a metric independent topological quantum field theory. The example
of a five dimensional non-Abelian BF theory with a boundary brane is
considered. A natural boundary condition is adopted chosen for consistency of
the topological action despite the presence of a boundary. The resulting
effective action on the brane is the action of general relativity in first
order form plus terms involving the extrinsic curvature of the brane.
