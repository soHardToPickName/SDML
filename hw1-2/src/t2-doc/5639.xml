On the Bound States in a Non-linear Quantum Field Theory of a Spinor
  Field with Higher Derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model of quantum field theory with higher derivatives for a
spinor field with quartic selfinteraction. With the help of the Bethe-Salpeter
equation we study the problem of the two particle bound states in the "chain"
approximation. The existence of a scalar bound state is established.
