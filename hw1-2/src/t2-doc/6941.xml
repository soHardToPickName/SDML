Invariant Effective Actions and Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the correspondence between effective actions resulting from
non-invariant Lagrangian densities, for Goldstone bosons arising from
spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry group G to a subgroup H, and non-trivial
generators of the de Rham cohomology of G/H. We summarize the construction of
cohomology generators in terms of symmetric tensors with certain invariance and
vanishing properties with respect to G and H. The resulting actions in four
dimensions arise either from products of generators of lower degree such as the
Goldstone-Wilczek current, or are of the Wess-Zumino-Witten type. Actions in
three dimensions arise as Chern-Simons terms evaluated on composite gauge
fields and may induce fractional spin on solitons. {Contribution to the
