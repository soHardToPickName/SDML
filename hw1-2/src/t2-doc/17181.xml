Analytical results for the confinement mechanism in QCD_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We present analytical methods for investigating the interaction of two heavy
quarks in QCD_3 using the effective action approach. Our findings result in
explicit expressions for the static potentials in QCD_3 for long and short
distances. With regard to confinement, our conclusion reflects many features
found in the more realistic world of QCD_4.
