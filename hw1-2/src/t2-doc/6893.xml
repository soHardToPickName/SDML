On T-Duality and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The interplay between T-duality and supersymmetry in string theory is
explored. It is shown that T-duality is always compatible with supersymmetry
and simply changes a local realization to a non-local one and vice versa.
Non-local realizations become natural using classical parafermions of the
underlying conformal field theory. Examples presented include hyper-kahler
metrics and the backgrounds for the SU(2) X U(1) and SU(2)/U(1) X U(1) X U(1)
exact conformal field theories.
