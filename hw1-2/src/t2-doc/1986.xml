The field theory limit of multiloop string amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on recent progress in the use of string techniques for the
computation of field theory amplitudes. We show how one-loop renormalization
constants in Yang-Mills theory can be computed using the open spinning string,
we review the calculation of two-loop scalar amplitudes with the bosonic
string, and we briefly indicate how the technique can be applied to the
two-loop vacuum bubbles of Yang-Mills theory.
