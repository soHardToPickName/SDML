A noncommutative-geometric interpretation of the resolution of
  equivariant instanton moduli spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the recently proposed noncommutative ADHM construction to the
case of $\Gamma$-equivariant instantons over $\R^4$, with $\Gamma$ a Kleinian
group. We show that a certain form of the inhomogeneous ADHM equations
describes instantons over a noncommutative deformation of the Kleinian orbifold
$\C^2/\Gamma$ and we discuss the relation of this with Nakajima's description
of instantons over ALE spaces. In particular, we obtain a noncommutative
interpretation of the minimal resolution of Kleinian singularities.
