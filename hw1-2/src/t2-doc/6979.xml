On Parasupersymmetries in Relativistic Coulomb Problem for the Modified
  Stueckelberg Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper presents a first example of parasupersymmetric relativistic
quantum-mechanical model with non-oscillator-like interaction: the Coulomb
problem for the modified Stueckelberg equation, describing a relativistic
massive spin-1 particle in the electromagnetic field of a point charge.
