Skyrmions on the Two-Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static solutions of the Skyrme model on the two-sphere of radius L,
for various choices of potential. The high-density Skyrmion phase corresponds
to the ratio beta=L/(size of Skyrmion) being small, whereas the low-density
phase corresponds to beta being large. The transition between these two phases,
and in particular the behaviour of a relevant order parameter, is examined.
