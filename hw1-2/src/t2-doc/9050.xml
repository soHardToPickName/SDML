Covariant Harmonic Supergraphity for N = 2 Super Yang--Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the background field method for general N = 2 super Yang-Mills
theories formulated in the N = 2 harmonic superspace. The covariant harmonic
supergraph technique is then applied to rigorously prove the N=2
non-renormalization theorem as well as to compute the holomorphic low-energy
action for the N = 2 SU(2) pure super Yang-Mills theory and the leading
non-holomorphic low-energy correction for N = 4 SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory.
