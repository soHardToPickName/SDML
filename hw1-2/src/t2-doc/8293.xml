Massive Gravity on a Non-extremal Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a brane world scenario which arises as the near-horizon region of
a non-extremal D5-brane. There is a quasi-localized massive graviton mode, as
well as harmonic modes of higher mass which are bound to the brane to a lesser
degree. Lorentz invariance is slightly broken, which may have observable
effects due to the leakage of the metastable graviton states into the bulk.
Unlike a brane world arising from an extremal D5-brane, there is no mass gap.
We also find that a brane world arising from a non-extremal M5/M5-brane
intersection has the same graviton dynamics as that of a non-extremal D5-brane.
This is evidence that a previously conjectured duality relation between the
dual quantum field theories of each p-brane background may hold away from
extremality.
