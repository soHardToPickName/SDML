Dirac theory from a field theoretic point of view
</title>

<abstract>
  Several complications arise in quantum field theory because of the infinite
many degrees of freedom. However, the distinction between one-particle and
many-particle effects -- mainly induced by the vacuum -- is not clear up to
now. A field theoretic picture of the one-particle Dirac theory is developed in
order to explore such questions. Main emphasis is laid on the injection of
Grassmann's algebra into the endomorphism Clifford algebra built over it. The
obtained ``field theoretic'' functional equation behaves in a very unusual way.
New methods to handle Dirac and QFT are given.
