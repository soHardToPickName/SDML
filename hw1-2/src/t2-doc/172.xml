Trivial Second-Order Lagrangians in Classial Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Trivial second-order Lagrangians are studied and a complete description of
the dependence on the second-order derivatives is given. This extends previous
work of Olver and others. In particular, this description involves some
polynomial expressions called hyper-Jacobians. There exists some linear
dependencies between these polynomials which are elucidated for the
(second-order) hyper-Jacobians.
