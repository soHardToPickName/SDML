Toward the Universal Theory of Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the $N=2$ superstrings may be viewed as a special class of the
$N=4$ superstrings and demonstrate their equivalence. This allows us to realize
all known string theories based on linear algebras and with $N<4$
supersymmetries as special choices of the vacua in the $N=4$ superstring.
