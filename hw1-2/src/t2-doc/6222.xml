Local Casimir Energy For Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Direct calculation of the one-loop contributions to the energy density of
bosonic and supersymmetric phi-to-the-fourth kinks exhibits: (1) Local mode
regularization. Requiring the mode density in the soliton and trivial sector to
be equal at each point in space yields the anomalous part of the energy
density. (2) Phase space factorization. A striking position-momentum
factorization for reflectionless potentials gives the non-anomalous energy
density a simple relation to that for the bound state. For the supersymmetric
kink, energy and central charge densities agree as expected.
