QCD Heat Kernel in Covariant Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We report the calculation of the fourth coefficient in an expansion of the
heat kernel of a non-minimal, non-abelian kinetic operator in an arbitrary
background gauge in arbitrary space-time dimension. The fourth coefficient is
shown to bring a nontrivial gauge dependence due to the contribution of the
lowest order off-shell gauge invariant structure.
