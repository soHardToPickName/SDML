  With the help of M-theory configuration of N=1 supersymmetric QCD, we analyze
the strong coupling moduli of N=1 theory and its relation with S-duality
transformation in N=2 supersymmetric QCD. As a result we confirm that two
type-IIA descriptions for N=1 supersymmetric QCD, one of them being strong
coupling description and another being weak, correspond to a single M-theory
description for N=1 supersymmetric QCD. The existence of singlet fields is also
discussed.
