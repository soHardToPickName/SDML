Hydrostatic Pressure of the O(N) $\phi^4$ Theory in the Large N Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a self-contained calculation of the hydrostatic pressure in
$\lambda \phi^{4}$ theory with O(N) internal symmetry. In the large N limit the
pressure can be expressed in a resummed form. Our calculations are based on
composite-operator renormalization. As a byproduct, the renormalized (or
improved) energy-momentum tensor is obtained. The Dyson-Schwinger equations are
used to discuss both the mass and coupling constant renormalization. We also
calculate the high-temperature expansion for the pressure in D=4. The latter is
done by means of the Mellin transform technique.
