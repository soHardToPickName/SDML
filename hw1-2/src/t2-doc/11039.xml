String loop correction and the condensation of tachyon in 2d gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum theory of 2d gravity is examined by including a special quantum
correction, which corresponds to the open string loop corrections and provides
a new conformal anomaly for the corresponding $\sigma$ model. This anomaly
leads to the condensation of the tachyon, and the resultant effective theory
implies a possibility of extending the 2d gravity to the case of $c>1$.
