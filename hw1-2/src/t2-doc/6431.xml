Conformal Quantum Mechanics in Two Black Hole Moduli Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss quantum mechanics in the moduli space consisting of two maximally
charged dilaton black holes. The quantum mechanics of the two black hole system
is similar to the one of DFF model, and this system has the $SL(2,R)$ conformal
symmetry. Also, we discuss the bound states in this system.
