(0,2) Target Space Duality, CICYs and Reflexive Sheaves
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the recently proposed target space duality for (0,2) models
is not limited to models admitting a Landau-Ginzburg description. By studying
some generic examples it is established for the broader class of vector bundles
over complete intersections in toric varieties. Instead of sharing a common
Landau-Ginzburg locus, a pair of dual models agrees in more general
non-geometric phases. The mathematical tools for treating reflexive sheaves are
provided, as well.
