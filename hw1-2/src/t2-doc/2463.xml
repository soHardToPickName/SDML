$h$-Deformation as a Contraction of $q$-Deformation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that $h$-deformation can be obtained, by a singular limit of a
similarity transformation, from $q$-deformation; to be specefic, we obtain
$\GL_h(2)$, its differential structure, its inhomogenous extension, and
$\Uh{\sl(2)}$ from their $q$-deformed counterparts.
