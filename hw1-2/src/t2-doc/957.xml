On Gauged Maximal Supergravity In Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The maximal SO(5) gauged D=7 supergravity is dimensionally reduced to six
dimensions yielding a new SO(5) gauged D=6 model. It is shown that, unlike in
D=7, the SO(5) gauge coupling constant can be taken to zero to yield the
maximally extended supergravity in six dimensions. It is also shown that the
limit of D=5 N=4 SU(2)xU(1) gauged supergravity in which the U(1) coupling
constant is turned off can be obtained.
