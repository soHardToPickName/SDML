All bicovariant differential calculi on Glq(3,C) and SLq(3,C)

<abstract>
  All bicovariant first order differential calculi on the quantum group
GLq(3,C) are determined. There are two distinct one-parameter families of
calculi. In terms of a suitable basis of 1-forms the commutation relations can
be expressed with the help of the R-matrix of GLq(3,C). Some calculi induce
bicovariant differential calculi on SLq(3,C) and on real forms of GLq(3,C). For
generic deformation parameter q there are six calculi on SLq(3,C), on SUq(3)
there are only two. The classical limit q-->1 of bicovariant calculi on
SLq(3,C) is not the ordinary calculus on SL(3,C). One obtains a deformation of
it which involves the Cartan-Killing metric.
