A conformal scalar dyon black hole solution
</title>

<abstract>
  An exact solution of Einstein - Maxwell - conformal scalar field equations is
given, which is a black hole solution and has three parameters: scalar charge,
electric charge, and magnetic charge. Switching off the magnetic charge
parameter yields the solution given by Bekenstein. In addition the energy of
the conformal scalar dyon black hole is obtained.
