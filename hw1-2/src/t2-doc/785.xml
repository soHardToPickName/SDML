Massless and spinning particles as dynamics in one dimensional
  (super)diffeomorphism groups
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that dynamics of D+2 elements of the (super)diffeomorphism group
in one (1+1 for the super) dimension describes the D - dimensional (spinning)
massless relativistic particles. The coordinates of this elements (D+2
einbeins, D+2 connections and 1 additional common coordinate of higher
dimensionality) play the role of coordinates, momenta and Lagrange multiplier,
needed for the manifestly conformal and reparametrization invariant description
of the D - dimensional (spinning) particle in terms of the D+2 - dimensional
spacetime.
