On the Classification of Bulk and Boundary Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The classification of rational conformal field theories is reconsidered from
the standpoint of boundary conditions. Solving Cardy's equation expressing the
consistency condition on a cylinder is equivalent to finding integer valued
representations of the fusion algebra. A complete solution not only yields the
admissible boundary conditions but also gives valuable information on the bulk
properties.
