Acceleration of the Universe in Type-0 Non-Critical Strings: a Review
</title>

<abstract>
  I review cosmology within the framework of type-0 non-critical strings,
proposed in collaboration with G. Diamandis, B. Georgalas, E. Papantonopoulos
and I. Pappa. The instabilities of the tachyonic backgrounds, due to the
absence of space-time supersymmetry, are treated in this framework as a
necessary ingredient to ensure cosmological flow. The model involves D3 brane
worlds, whose initial quantum fluctuations induce the non criticality. I argue
that this model is compatible with the current astrophysical observations
pointing towards acceleration of the Universe. A crucial r\^ole for the correct
``phenomenology'' of the model, in particular the order-one value of the
deceleration parameter, is played by the relative magnitude of the flux of the
five form of the type-0 string as compared to the size of the volume of five of
the extra dimensions, transverse to the direction of the flux-field.
