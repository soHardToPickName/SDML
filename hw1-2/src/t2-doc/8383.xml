Target Space Interpretation of New Moduli in 2D String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the new states that have recently been discovered in 2D string
theory by E. Witten and B. Zwiebach. Since the Liouville direction is
uncompactified, we show that the deformations by the new ghost number two
states generate equivalent classical solutions of the string fields. We argue
that the new ghost number one states are responsible for generating
transformations which relate such equivalent solutions. We also discuss the
possible interpretation of higher ghost number states of those kinds.
