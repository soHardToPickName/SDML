W-Algebras of Negative Rank
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it has been discovered that the W-algebras (orbifold of) WD_n can be
defined even for negative integers n by an analytic continuation of their
coupling constants. In this letter we shall argue that also the algebras
WA_{-n-1} can be defined and are finitely generated. In addition, we show that
a surprising connection exists between already known W-algebras, for example
between the CP(k)-models and the U(1)-cosets of the generalized
Polyakov-Bershadsky-algebras.
