New Approximations to the Fradkin representation for Green's functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A new variant of the exact Fradkin representation of the Green's function
$G_c(x,y|gU)$, defined for arbitrary external potential $U$, is presented.
Although this new approach is very similar in spirit to that previously derived
by Fried and Gabellini, for certain calculations this specific variant, with
its prescribed approximations, is more readily utilizable. Application of the
simplest of these forms is made to the $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory in four
dimensions.
  As an independent check of these approximate forms, an improved version of
the Schwinger-DeWitt asymptotic expansion of parametrix function is derived.
