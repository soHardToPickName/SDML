The Conformal Points Of The Generalized Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The conformal fixed points of the generalized Thirring model are investigated
with the help of bosonization, the large N limit and the operator product
expansion. Necessary conditions on the coupling constants for conformal
invariance are derived.
