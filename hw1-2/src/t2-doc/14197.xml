Free conical dynamics: charge-monopole as a particle with spin, anyon
  and nonlinear fermion-monopole supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the origin of the effectively free dynamics of the charge in the
magnetic monopole field to apply it for finding the alternative treatment of
the charge-monopole as a particle with spin, for tracing out the relation of
the charge-monopole to the free relativistic anyon and for clarifying the
nature of the non-standard nonlinear supersymmetry of the fermion-monopole
system.
