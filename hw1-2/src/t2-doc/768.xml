Vacuum polarization of supersymmetric D-brane in the constant
  electromagnetic field

<abstract>
  We study the vacuum polarization of supersymmetric toroidal D-brane placed in
the constant electromagnetic field. Explicit calculation of the one-loop
effective potential is performed for membrane with constant magnetic or
electric background. We find the one-loop potentials vanish as the effect of
supersymmetry,
