Kontsevich-Witten Model From 2+1 Gravity: New Exact Combinatorial
  Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  In previous publications (J.Geom.Phys.38 (2001) 81-139 and references
therein) the partition function for 2+1 gravity was constructed for the fixed
genus Riemann surface. With help of this function the dynamical transition from
pseudo-Anosov to periodic (Seifert-fibered) regime was studied.In this paper
the periodic regime is studied in some detail in order to recover major results
of Kontsevich (Comm.Math.Phys. 147 (1992) 1-23) ispired by earlier work by
Witten on topological two dimensional quantum gravity.To achieve this goal some
results from enumerative combinatorics have been used. The logical developments
are extensively illustrated using geometrically convincing figures. This
feature is helpful for development of some non traditional applications
(mentioned through the entire text) of obtained results to fields other than
theoretical particle physics
