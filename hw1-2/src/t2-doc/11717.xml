Quantum Einstein Gravity as a Topological Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  General covariance in quantum gravity is seen once one integrates over all
possible metrics. In recent years topological field theories have given us a
different route to general covariance without integrating over all possible
metrics. Here we argue that Einstein quantum gravity may be viewed as a
topological field theory provided a certain constrant from the path integral
measure is satisfied.
