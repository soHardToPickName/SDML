Invariant Indentities in the Heisenberg Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Polynomial relations between the generators of $q$--deformed
Heisenberg algebra  invariant under the quantization and $q$-deformation
are discovered.
One of the examples of such relations is the following:  if two elements
$a$ and $b$, obeying the relation
\[
ab - q ba  = p,
\]
where $p, q$ are any complex numbers, then for any $p,q$ and natural $n$
\[
(aba)^n = a^n b^n a^n
\]
