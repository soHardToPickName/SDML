Higher Spin Symmetries, Star-Product and Relativistic Equations in AdS
  Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss general properties of the theory of higher spin gauge fields in
$AdS_4$ focusing on the relationship between the star-product origin of the
higher spin symmetries, AdS geometry and the concept of space-time locality. A
full list of conserved higher spin currents in the flat space of arbitrary
dimension is presented.
