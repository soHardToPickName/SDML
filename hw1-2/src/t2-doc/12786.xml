Orbifolds as Melvin Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we explicitly show that the various noncompact abelian
orbifolds are realized as special limits of parameters in type II (NSNS) Melvin
background and its higher dimensional generalizations. As a result the
supersymmetric ALE spaces (A-type C^2/Z_N) and nonsupersymmetric orbifolds in
type II and type 0 theory are all connected with each other by the exactly
marginal deformation. Our results provide new examples of the duality between
type II and type 0 string theory. We also discuss the decay of unstable
backgrounds in this model which include closed string tachyons.
