Consistent perturbative light-front formulation of quantum
  electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  A new light-front formulation of Q.E.D. is developed, within the framework of
standard perturbation theory, in which $x^+$ plays the role of the evolution
parameter and the gauge choice is $A_+=0$ (light-front "temporal" gauge). It is
shown that this formulation leads to the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt causal
prescription for the non-covariant singularities in the photon propagator.
Furthermore, it is proved that the dimensionally regularized one loop off-shell
amplitudes exactly coincide with the correct ones, as computed within the
standard approach using ordinary space-time coordinates.
