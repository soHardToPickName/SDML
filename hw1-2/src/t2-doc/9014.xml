Reduced SL(2,R) WZNW Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The $SL(2,\R)$ WZNW $\rightarrow$ Liouville reduction leads to a nontrivial
phase space on the classical level both in $0+1$ and $1+1$ dimensions. To study
the consequences in the quantum theory, the quantum mechanics of the $0+1$
dimensional, point particle version of the constrained WZNW model is
investigated. The spectrum and the eigenfunctions of the obtained---rather
nontrivial---theory are given, and the physical connection between the pieces
of the reduced configuration space is discussed in all the possible cases of
the constraint parameters.
