Dimensionally Reduced Yang-Mills Theories in Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a class of noncommutative geometries that give rise to dimensionally
reduced Yang-Mills theories. The emerging geometries describe sets of copies of
an even dimensional manifold. Similarities to the D-branes in string theory are
discussed.
