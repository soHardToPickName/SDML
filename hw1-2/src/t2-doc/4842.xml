Entanglement Entropy of Nontrivial States
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the entanglement entropy arising from coherent states and
one--particle states. We show that it is possible to define a finite
entanglement entropy by subtracting the vacuum entropy from that of the
considered states, when the unobserved region is the same.
