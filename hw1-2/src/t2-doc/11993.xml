Determinants of Dirac operators with local boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study functional determinants for Dirac operators on manifolds with
boundary. We give, for local boundary conditions, an explicit formula relating
these determinants to the corresponding Green functions. We finally apply this
result to the case of a bidimensional disk under bag-like conditions.
