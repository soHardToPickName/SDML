Vacuum solutions for scalar fields confined in cavities
</title>

<abstract>
  We look at vacuum solutions for fields confined in cavities where the
boundary conditions can rule out constant field configurations, other than the
zero field. If the zero field is unstable, symmetry breaking can occur to a
field configuration of lower energy which is not constant. The stability of the
zero field is determined by the size of the length scales which characterize
the cavity and parameters that enter the scalar field potential. There can be a
critical length at which an instability of the zero field sets in. In addition
to looking at the rectangular and spherical cavity in detail, we describe a
general method which can be used to find approximate analytical solutions when
the length scales of the cavity are close to the critical value.
