Perturbative Bosonic End Anyon Spectra and Contact Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Bosonic end perturbative calculations for quantum mechanical anyon systems
require a regularization. I regularize by adding a specific $\delta$-function
potential to the Hamiltonian. The reliability of this regularization procedure
is verified by comparing its results for the 2-anyon in harmonic potential
system with the known exact solutions. I then use the $\delta$-function
regularized bosonic end perturbation theory to test some recent conjectures
concerning the unknown portion of the many-anyon spectra.
