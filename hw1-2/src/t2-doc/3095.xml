Coupling the Superstring to a D-Brane Ramond-Ramond Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new approach for coupling the type II superstring to the
Ramond-Ramond background of D-branes in the RNS formalism, alternative to
introducing RR vertex operators. It is based on the mixing between
Ramond-Ramond p-form excitations in the closed string spectrum and
transversally polarized excitations in the open string spectrum.
