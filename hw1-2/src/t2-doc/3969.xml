Generalized Fusion Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, DiFrancesco and Zuber have characterized the RCFTs which have a
description in terms of a fusion potential in one variable, and proposed a
generalized potential to describe other theories. In this note we give a simple
criterion to determine when such a generalized description is possible. We also
determine which RCFTs can be described by a fusion potential in more than one
variable, finding that in fact all RCFTs can be described in such a way, as
conjectured by Gepner.
