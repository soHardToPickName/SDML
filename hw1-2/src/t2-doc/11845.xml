Wave-function profile and SUSY breaking in 5D model with
  Fayet-Iliopoulos term
</title>

<abstract>
  We study systematically VEVs of a gauge scalar field $\Sigma$ in bulk U(1)
vector multiplet and scalar fields in brane/bulk hypermultiplets charged under
the U(1) in the 5D $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold model with generic FI terms. A
non-trivial VEV of $\Sigma$ generates bulk mass terms for U(1) charged fields
and their zero-modes have non-trivial profiles. In particular, in the SUSY
breaking case, bosonic and fermionic zero modes have Gaussian profiles. Such
non-trivial profiles are useful to explain hierarchical couplings. A toy model
for SUSY breaking is studied and that results in the sizable $D$-term
contributions to scalar masses. Because the overall magnitude of $D$-term
contributions are same everywhere in bulk and also on both branes, we have to
take into account these contributions and other SUSY breaking terms for a
realistic scenario to explain Yukawa hierarchy. We also give profiles and mass
eigenvalues of higher modes.
