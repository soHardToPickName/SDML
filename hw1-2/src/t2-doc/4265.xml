Wound String Scattering in NCOS Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the amplitude for a non-excited closed string with nonzero
winding number to scatter from a D-string with a near critical E field. We go
to the NCOS limit and observe that we get the same result if we adopt another
approach put forward by Gomis and Ooguri.
