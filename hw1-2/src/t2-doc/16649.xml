The Internal Geometry of an Evaporating Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a semi-classical model for the formation and evaporation of a four
dimensional black hole. We solve the equations numerically and obtain solutions
describing the entire the space-time geometry from the collapse to the end of
the evaporation. The solutions satisfy the evaporation law: $\dot M \propto
-M^{-2}$ which confirms dynamically that black holes do evaporate thermally. We
find that the evaporation process is in fact the shrinking of a throat that
connects a macroscopic interior ``universe" to the asymptotically flat
exterior. It ends either by pinching off the throat leaving a closed universe
and a Minkowskian exterior or by freezing up when the throat's radius
approaches a Planck size. In either case the macroscopic inner universe is the
region where the information lost during the evaporation process is hidden.
