A Modified Scheme of Triplectic Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  A modified version of triplectic quantization, first introduce by Batalin and
Martnelius, is proposed which makes use of two independent master equations,
one for the action and one for the gauge functional such that the initial
classical action also obeys that master equation.
