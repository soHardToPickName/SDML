Simple Quantum Systems in Spacetimes with Closed Timelike Curves
</title>

<abstract>
  Three simple examples illustrate properties of path integral amplitudes in
fixed background spacetimes with closed timelike curves: non-relativistic
potential scattering in the Born approximation is non-unitary, but both an
example with hard spheres and the exact solution of a totally discrete model
are unitary.
