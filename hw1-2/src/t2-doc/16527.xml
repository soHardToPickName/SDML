The problem of Initial Data in Cosmology and Conformal General
  Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of initial data in cosmology and general relativity is considered
by analogy with the Cauchy problem in Newton mechanics where initial data
reveal the Galilei symmetry of physical laws, i.e., equations of motion.
  We list a set of theoretical and observational arguments (including the
latest Supernova data, primordial nucleosynthesis, CMB-temperature, and baryon
asymmetry) in favour of conformal symmetry of physical laws in a unified field
theory of all interactions, where all dimensional parameters are hidden in
masses treated as a scalar (dilaton) field.
