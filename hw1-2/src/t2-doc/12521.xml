A Simple Derivation of the Hard Thermal Loop Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the background field method along with a special gauge condition, to
derive the hard thermal loop effective action in a simple manner. The new point
in the paper is to relate the effective action explicitly to the S-matrix from
the onset.
