On The Baxter's Q - Operator for the XXX Spin Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the construction of Baxter's Q-operator. The suggested approach
leads to the one-parametric family of Q-operators, satisfying to the
wronslian-type relations. Also we have found the generalization of Baxter
operators, with defines the nondiagonal part of the monodromy.
