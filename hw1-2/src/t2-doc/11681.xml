Sigma-model Solutions and Intersecting p-Branes Related to Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  A family of Majumdar-Papapetrou type solutions in sigma-model of p-brane
origin is obtained for all direct sums of finite-dimensional simple Lie
algebras. Several examples of p-brane dyonic configurations in D=10 (IIA) and
D=11 supergravities corresponding to the Lie algebra sl(3,C) are considered.
