A general non renormalization theorem in the extended antifield
  formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of algebraic renormalization, the extended antifield formalism
is used to derive the general forms of the anomaly consistency condition and of
the Callan-Symanzik equation for generic gauge theories. A local version of the
latter is used to derive sufficient conditions for the vanishing of beta
functions associated to terms whose integrands are invariant only up to a
divergence for an arbitrary non trivial non anomalous symmetry of the
Lagrangian. These conditions are independent of power counting restrictions and
of the form of the gauge fixation.
