D0-Branes As Confined Quarks
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of using the quantum mechanics of D0-branes for the
bound-states of quarks and QCD strings is investigated. Issues such as the
inter D0-branes potential, the whiteness of the D0-branes bound-states and the
large-N limit of D0-branes effective theory are studied. A possible role of the
non-commutativity of relative distances of D0-branes in a study of ordinary QCD
is discussed.
