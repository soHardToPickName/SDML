Pseudoclassical model for topologically massive gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A pseudoclassical model for P,T-invariant system of topologically massive
U(1) gauge fields is analyzed. The model demonstrates a nontrivial relationship
between continuous and discrete symmetries and reveals a phenomenon of
``classical quantization''. It allows one to identify SU(1,1) symmetry and
S(2,1) supersymmetry as hidden symmetries of the corresponding quantum system.
We show this P,T-invariant quantum system realizes an irreducible
representation of a non-standard super-extension of the (2+1)-dimensional
Poincare group.
