Interaction of electric charges in (2+1)D magnetic dipole gas
</title>

<abstract>
  The interaction of electrically charged particles in a dilute gas of
point--like magnetic dipoles is studied. We show that the interaction potential
at small distances has a linear piece due to overlap of the dipole clouds
gathered near electric sources. At large distances the potential becomes of the
Coulomb type with non-perturbatively renormalized charge of the test particle.
The physical applications of these results are discussed.
