Semiclassical description of D-branes in SL(2)/U(1) gauged WZW model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we examine some semiclassical features of D-branes in the
SL(2)/U(1) gauged WZW model and determine the small fluctuation spectra for one
class of branes. We compare our results with expectations from the CFT side.
