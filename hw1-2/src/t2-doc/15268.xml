Aspects of QCD Dynamics from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study dynamical aspects of large N QCD_4 via supergravity on Anti de
Sitter black hole geometry. We compute the mass spectrum, the topological
susceptibility and the gluon condensate and make a comparison to lattice
simulations. We present analogous results for QCD_3.
