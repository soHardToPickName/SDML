Fundamental S-matrix for vector perturbed WD_n minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  Kink-kink S-matrix for integrable vector perturbed
$WD_{n}^{(k)}$ minimal
models is constructed from the Boltzmann weights of $A_{2n-1}^{(2)}$
 RSOS model and checked in two limit cases  $k=1$ and $k\rightarrow
\infty$
