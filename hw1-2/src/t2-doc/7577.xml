Physical fields and Clifford algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The physical fields (electromagnetic and electron fields) considered in the
framework of Clifford algebras $\C_2$ and $\C_4$. The electron field described
by the algebra $\C_4$ which in spinor representation is realized by well-known
Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, and by force of isomorphism $\C_{4}\cong\C_{2}\otimes
\C_{2}$ is represented as a tensor product of two photon fields. By means of
this introduced a system of electron field equations, which in particular cases
is coincide with Dirac's and Maxwell's equations.
