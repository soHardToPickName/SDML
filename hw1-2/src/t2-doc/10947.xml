Absence of a VVDZ Discontinuity in AdS_AdS
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify the role of gauge invariance for the theory of an AdS4 brane
embedded in AdS5. The presence of a nonvanishing mass parameter even for the
lightest KK mode of the graviton indicates that all of the spin-2 modes
propagate five polarization states. Despite this fact, it was shown earlier
that the classical theory has a smooth limit as the mass parameter is taken to
zero. We argue that locality in the fifth dimension ensures that this property
survives at the quantum level.
