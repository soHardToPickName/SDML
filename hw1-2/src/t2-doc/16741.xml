Soft Supersymmetry Breaking in Deformed Moduli Spaces, Conformal
  Theories, and N = 2 Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a self-contained discussion of recent progress in computing the
non-perturbative effects of small non-holomorphic soft supersymmetry breaking,
including a simple new derivation of these results based on an anomaly-free
gauged U(1)_R background. We apply these results to N = 1 theories with
deformed moduli spaces and conformal fixed points. In an SU(2) theory with a
deformed moduli space, we completely determine the vacuum expectation values
and induced soft masses. We then consider the most general soft breaking of
supersymmetry in N = 2 SU(2) super-Yang-Mills theory. An N = 2 superfield
spurion analysis is used to give an elementary derivation of the relation
between the modulus and the prepotential in the effective theory. This analysis
also allows us to determine the non-perturbative effects of all soft terms
except a non-holomorphic scalar mass, away from the monopole points. We then
use an N = 1 spurion analysis to determine the effects of the most general soft
breaking, and also analyze the monopole points. We show that naive dimensional
analysis works perfectly. Also, a soft mass for the scalar in this theory
forces the theory into a free Coulomb phase.
