Punctures in W-string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the differential equation approach to W-algebras, we discuss the
inclusion of punctures in W-string theory. The key result is the existence of
different kinds of punctures in W-strings. This is similar to the NS and R
punctures occuring in superstring theories. We obtain the moduli associated
with these punctures and present evidence in existing W-string theories for
these punctures. The $W_3$ case is worked out in detail. It is conjectured that
the $(1,3)$ minimal model coupled to two dimensional gravity corresponds to
topological $W_3$-gravity.
