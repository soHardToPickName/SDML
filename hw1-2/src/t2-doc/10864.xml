A model for time-dependent cosmological constant and its consistency
  with the present Friedmann universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a model where the cosmological term can be related to the chiral gauge
anomaly of a possible quantum scenario of the initial evolution of the
universe. We show that this term is compatible with the Friedmann behavior of
the present universe.
