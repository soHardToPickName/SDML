Nonrenormalization of Mass of Some Nonsupersymmetric String States
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the quantum correction to the mass of some very massive,
nonsupersymmetric states vanishes in inverse proportion to their tree-level
mass to all orders in string loops. This approximate nonrenormalization can
explain the agreement between the perturbative degeneracy of these states and
the Sen entropy of the associated black holes.
