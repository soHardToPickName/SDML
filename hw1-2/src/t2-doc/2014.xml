One-loop effective multi-gluon Lagrangian in arbitrary dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit the one-loop multi-gluon effective Lagrangian in any dimension for
a field theory with a quasilocal background, using the background-field
formalism. Specific results, including counter terms (up to 12 spacetime
dimensions), have been derived, applied to the Yang-Mills theory and found to
be in agreement with other string-inspired approaches.
