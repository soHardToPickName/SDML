On the Question of Degeneracy of Topological Solitons in a Gauged O(3)
  Non-Linear Sigma Model with Chern-Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the degeneracy of topological solitons in the gauged O(3)
non-linear sigma model with Chern-Simons term may be removed by chosing a
self-interaction potential with symmetry - breaking minima. The topological
solitons in the model has energy,charge,flux and angular momentum quantised in
each topological sector.
