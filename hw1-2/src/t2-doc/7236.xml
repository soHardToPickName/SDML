BPS Saturated Vacua Interpolation along One Compact Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of generalized Wess-Zumino models with distinct vacua is
investigated. These models allow for BPS saturated vacua interpolation along
one compact spatial dimension. The properties of these interpolations are
studied.
