Euclidean Thermal Green Functions of Photons in Generalized Euclidean
  Rindler Spaces for any Feynman-like Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermal Euclidean Green functions for Photons propagating in the Rindler
wedge are computed employing an Euclidean approach within any covariant
Feynman-like gauge. This is done by generalizing a formula which holds in the
Minkowskian case. The coincidence of the found $(\be=2\pi)$-Green functions and
the corresponding Minkowskian vacuum Green functions is discussed in relation
to the remaining static gauge ambiguity already found in previous papers.
Further generalizations to more complicated manifolds are discussed. Ward
identities are verified in the general case.
