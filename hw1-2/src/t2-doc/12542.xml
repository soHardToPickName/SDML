Electron-positron pair creation in a vacuum by an electromagnetic field
  in 3+1 and lower dimensions

<abstract>
  We calculate the probability of electron-positron pair creation in vacuum in
3+1 dimensions by an external electromagnetic field composed of a constant
uniform electric field and a constant uniform magnetic field, both of arbitrary
magnitudes and directions. The same problem is also studied in 2+1 and 1+1
dimensions in appropriate external fields and similar results are obtained.
