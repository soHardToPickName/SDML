Anomaly mediation in supergravity theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the effects of anomalies on the supersymmetry-breaking parameters
in supergravity theories. We construct a supersymmetric expression for the
anomaly-induced terms in the 1PI effective action; we use this result to
compute the complete one-loop formula for the anomaly-induced gaugino mass. The
mass receives contributions from the super-Weyl, Kahler, and sigma-model
anomalies of the supergravity theory. We point out that the anomaly-mediated
gaugino mass can be affected by local counterterms that cancel the
super-Weyl-Kahler anomaly. This implies that the gaugino mass cannot be
predicted unless the full high-energy theory is known.
