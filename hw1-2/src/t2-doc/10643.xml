A Note on Closed Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Special kind of closed strings is considered. It is shown that these closed
strings behave as two (an even number of) open strings at the classical level
and almost one open string at the quantum level. They contain photons in their
spectrum and can lie on D branes. Some properties of closed string field
effective action are declared.
