Harmonic-Superspace Integrability of N=1, D=6 Supersymmetric Gauge
  Theory

<abstract>
  We consider the harmonic-superspace ($HS$) system of equations that contains
superfield $SYM^1_6$ constraints and equations of motion. A dynamical equation
in the special $A$-frame is equivalent to the zero-curvature equation
corresponding to a covariant conservation of $HS$-analyticity. Properties of a
general $SYM^1_6$ solution for the gauge group $SU(2)$ are studied in the
simplest harmonic gauge. An analogous approach to the integrability
interpretation of $SYM$-$SG$-matter systems in $HS$ is discussed briefly.
