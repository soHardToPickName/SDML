Anyonic behavior of quantum group gases
</title>

<abstract>
  We first introduce and discuss the formalism of $SU_q(N)$-bosons and fermions
and consider the simplest Hamiltonian involving these operators. We then
calculate the grand partition function for these models and study the high
temperature (low density) case of the corresponding gases for $N=2$. We show
that quantum group gases exhibit anyonic behavior in $D=2$ and $D=3$ spatial
dimensions. In particular, for a $SU_q(2)$ boson gas at $D=2$ the parameter $q$
interpolates within a wider range of attractive and repulsive systems than the
anyon statistical parameter.
