Curved BPS domain wall solutions in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct four-dimensional domain wall solutions of N=2 gauged
supergravity coupled to vector and to hypermultiplets. The gauged supergravity
theories that we consider are obtained by performing two types of Abelian
gauging. In both cases we find that the behaviour of the scalar fields
belonging to the vector multiplets is governed by the so-called attractor
equations known from the study of BPS black hole solutions in ungauged N=2
supergravity theories. The scalar fields belonging to the hypermultiplets, on
the other hand, are either constant or exhibit a run-away behaviour. These
domain wall solutions preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry and they are, in general,
curved. We briefly comment on the amount of supersymmetry preserved by domain
wall solutions in gauged supergravity theories obtained by more general
gaugings.
