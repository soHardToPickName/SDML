On the necessity to reconsider the role of "action-at-a-distance" in the
  problem of the electro-magnetic field radiation produced by a charge moving
  with an acceleration along an axis
</title>

<abstract>
  Some inadequacy in the traditional description of the phenomenon of
electro-magnetic field radiation created by a point charge moving along a
straight line with an acceleration is found and discussed in this paper in
detail. The possibility of simultaneous coexistence of Newton instantaneous
long-range interaction and Faraday-Maxwell short-rang interaction is pointed
out.
