Schwinger terms of the commutator of two interacting currents in the 1+1
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the equal-time commutator of two fermionic currents within the
framework of the 1+1 dimensional fully quantized theory, describing the
interaction of massive fermions with a massive vector boson. It is shown that
the interaction does not change the result obtained within the theory of free
fermions.
