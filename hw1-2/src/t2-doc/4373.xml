Casimir Force in Compact Noncommutative Extra Dimensions and Radius
  Stabilization
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the one loop Casimir energy of an interacting scalar field in a
compact noncommutative space of $R^{1,d}\times T^2_\theta$, where we have
ordinary flat $1+d$ dimensional Minkowski space and two dimensional
noncommuative torus. We find that next order correction due to the
noncommutativity still contributes an attractive force and thus will have a
quantum instability. However, the case of vector field in a periodic boundary
condition gives repulsive force for $d>5$ and we expect a stabilized radius.
This suggests a stabilization mechanism for a senario in Kaluza-Klein theory,
where some of the extra dimensions are noncommutative.
