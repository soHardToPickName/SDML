Graph Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a new mathematical structure ( graph quantum group) which combines
the tower of algebras associated with a graph ${\cal G}$ and the structure of a
Hopf algebra {\cal A}. In this structure Ocneanu's string operators become Hopf
algebra intertwiners. We present some examples of graph quantum groups.
