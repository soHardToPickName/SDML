Homological Algebra and Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The antifield-BRST formalism and the various cohomologies associated with it
are surveyed and illustrated in the context of Yang-Mills gauge theory. In
particular, the central role played by the Koszul-Tate resolution and its
relation to the characteristic cohomology are stressed.
