Bulk Supersymmetry and Brane Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a recent proposal to solve the cosmological constant problem
within the context of brane world scenarios with infinite volume extra
dimensions. In such theories bulk can be supersymmetric even if brane
supersymmetry is completely broken. We propose a setup where unbroken bulk
supersymmetry appears to protect the brane cosmological constant. This is due
to a non-trivial scalar potential in the bulk which implies a non-trivial
profile for a bulk scalar field. In the presence of the latter bulk
supersymmetry appears to be incompatible with non-vanishing brane cosmological
constant. Moreover, in this setup the corresponding domain wall interpolates
between an AdS and the Minkowski vacua, so that the weak energy condition is
not violated.
