The unmasking of thermal Goldstone bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of extracting the modes of Goldstone bosons from a thermal
background is reconsidered in the framework of relativistic quantum field
theory. It is shown that in the case of spontaneous breakdown of an internal
bosonic symmetry a recently established decomposition of thermal correlation
functions contains certain specific contributions which can be attributed to a
particle of zero mass.
