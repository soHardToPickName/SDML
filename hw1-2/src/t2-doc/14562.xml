Fusing the coordinates of quantum superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the notion of a fused quantum superplane by allowing for terms
$\theta\theta\sim x$ in the defining relations. We develop the differential
calculus for a large class of fused quantum superplanes related to particular
solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.
