Wrapped Branes and Confined Momentum
</title>

<abstract>
  We present string-like soliton solutions of three-dimensional gravity,
coupled to a compact scalar field $x^{11}$ and Kaluza-Klein reduced on a
circle. These solitons carry fractional magnetic flux with respect to the
Kaluza-Klein gauge field. Summing over such ``Kaluza-Klein flux tubes'' is
shown to imply summing over a subclass of three-dimensional topologies (Seifert
manifolds). It is also shown to imply an area law for the Wilson loop of the
Kaluza-Klein gauge field; the confined charge is nothing but Kaluza-Klein
momentum. Applied to the membrane of M-theory, this is interpreted as
``dynamical wrapping'' of the M-brane around its eleventh embedding dimension
$x^{11}$.
