Kaluza-Klein and H-Dyons in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Kaluza-Klein monopole and H-monopole solutions, which are T-dual to each
other, are the well-known solutions of string theory compactified on $T^6$.
Since string theory in this case has an S-duality symmetry, we explicitly
construct the corresponding dyonic solutions by expressing the $D = 4$ string
effective action in a manifestly $SL(2, R)$ invariant form with an $SL(2, R)$
invariant constraint. The Schwarz-Sen charge spectrum, the BPS saturated mass
formula as well as the stability of these states are discussed briefly.
