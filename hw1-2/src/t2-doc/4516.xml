Thermal Conditions for Scalar Bosons in a Curved Space Time
</title>

<abstract>
  The conditions that allow us to consider the vacuum expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor as a statistical average, at some particular
temperature, are given. When the mean value of created particles is stationary,
a planckian distribution for the field modes is obtained. In the massless
approximation, the temperature dependence is as that corresponding to a
radiation dominated Friedmann-like model.
