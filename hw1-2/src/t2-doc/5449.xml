Self-duality equations for spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A model of spherically symmetric SU(2) gauge theory is considered. The
self-duality equations are written and it is shown that they are compatible
with the Einstein-Yang-Mills equations. It is proven that this property is true
for any gauge theory with curved base space-time and having a compact Lie group
as structural group.
