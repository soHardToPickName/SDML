Intersections involving waves and monopoles in eleven dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider intersections in eleven dimensions involving Kaluza-Klein
monopoles and Brinkmann waves. Besides these purely gravitational
configurations we also construct solutions to the equations of motion that
involve additional M2- and M5-branes. The maximal number of independent objects
in these intersections is nine, and such maximal configurations, when reduced
to two dimensions, give rise to a 0-brane solution with dilaton coupling
a=-4/9.
