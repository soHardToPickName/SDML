Effect of Dynamical SU(2) Gluons to the Gap Equation of
  Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model in Constant Background Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to estimate the effect of dynamical gluons to chiral condensate, the
gap equation of SU(2) gauged Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model, under a constant
background magnetic field, is investigated up to the two-loop order in 2+1 and
3+1 dimensions. We set up a general formulation allowing both cases of electric
as well as magnetic background field. We rely on the proper time method to
maintain gauge invariance. In 3+1 dimensions chiral symmetry breaking
($\chi$SB) is enhanced by gluons even in zero background magnetic field and
becomes much striking as the background field grows larger. In 2+1 dimensions
gluons also enhance $\chi$SB but whose dependence on the background field is
not simple: dynamical mass is not a monotone function of background field for a
fixed four-fermi coupling.
