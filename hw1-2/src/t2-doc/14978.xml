Physical masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the Ward-Takahashi identities in the Landau gauge, we derive exact
relations between particle masses and the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs
field in the Abelian gauge field theory with a Higgs meson.
