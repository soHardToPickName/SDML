Supergravity Instantons for N=2 Hypermultiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  The dimensional reduction of eleven dimensional supergravity on a Calabi-Yau
manifold gives N=2 supergravity in five dimensions with $h_{1,1}$ vector and
$h_{2,1}+1$ hypermultiplets. In this paper instanton solutions are constructed
which are responsible for nonperturbtative corrections to the hypermultiplet
moduli spaces. These instantons are wrapped Euclidean membranes and fivebranes.
For vanishing fivebrane charge the BPS conditions for these solutions define a
flow in the hypermultiplet moduli space and are isomorphic to the attractor
equations for four dimensional black holes.
