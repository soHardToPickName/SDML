On (multi-)center branes and exact string vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  Multicenter supergravity solutions corresponding to Higgs phases of
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories are considered. For NS5 branes we identify
three cases where there is a description in terms of exact conformal field
theories. Other supergravity solutions, such as D3-branes with angular
momentum, are understood as special limits of multicenter ones. Within our
context we also consider 4-dim gravitational multi-instantons.
