Gravitational Couplings of D-branes and O-planes
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit calculation is performed to check all the tangent bundle
gravitational couplings of Dirichlet branes and Orientifold planes by
scattering $q$ gravitons with a $p+1$ form Ramond-Ramond potential in the
world-volume of a $D(p+2q)$-brane. The structure of the D-brane Wess-Zumino
term in the world-volume action is confirmed, while a different O-plane
Wess-Zumino action is obtained.
