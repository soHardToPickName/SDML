RS1, Higher Derivatives and Stability
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the classical stability of the weak/Planck hierarchy within
the Randall-Sundrum scenario, incorporating the Goldberger-Wise mechanism and
higher-derivative interactions in a systematic perturbative expansion. Such
higher-derivative interactions are expected if the RS model is the low-energy
description of some more fundamental theory. Generically, higher derivatives
lead to ill-defined singularities in the vicinity of effective field theory
branes. These are carefully treated by the methods of classical
renormalization.
