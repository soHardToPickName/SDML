Higher-order simple Lie algebras

<abstract>
  It is shown that the non-trivial cocycles on simple Lie algebras may be used
to introduce antisymmetric multibrackets which lead to higher-order Lie
algebras, the definition of which is given. Their generalised Jacobi identities
turn out to be satisfied by the antisymmetric tensors (or higher-order
`structure constants') which characterise the Lie algebra cocycles. This
analysis allows us to present a classification of the higher-order simple Lie
algebras as well as a constructive procedure for them. Our results are
synthesised by the introduction of a single, complete BRST operator associated
with each simple algebra.
