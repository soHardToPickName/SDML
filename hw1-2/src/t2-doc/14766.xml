The Heat Kernel Coefficients to the Matrix Schr\"odinger Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  The heat kernel coefficients $H_k$ to the Schr\"odinger operator with a
matrix potential are investigated. We present algorithms and explicit
expressions for the Taylor coefficients of the $H_k$. Special terms are
discussed, and for the one-dimensional case some improved algorithms are
derived.
