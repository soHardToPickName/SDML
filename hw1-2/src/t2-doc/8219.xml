Boundary states and finite size effects in sine-Gordon model with
  Neumann boundary condition
</title>

<abstract>
  The sine-Gordon model with Neumann boundary condition is investigated. Using
the bootstrap principle the spectrum of boundary bound states is established.
Somewhat surprisingly it is found that Coleman-Thun diagrams and bound state
creation may coexist. A framework to describe finite size effects in boundary
integrable theories is developed and used together with the truncated conformal
space approach to confirm the bound states and reflection factors derived by
bootstrap.
