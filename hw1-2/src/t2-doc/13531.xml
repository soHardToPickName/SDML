Master Equations for Master Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  The general lines of the derivation and the main properties of the master
equations for the master amplitudes associated to a given Feynman graph are
recalled. Some results for the 2-loop self-mass graph with 4 propagators are
then presented.
