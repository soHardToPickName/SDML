Supergravity Duals for N=2 Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions for Dp-branes at orbifold points. The
solutions are written in terms of a single function, which is the solution to a
nonlinear differential equation. The near horizon limits of these solutions are
dual, in the AdS/CFT sense, to super-Yang-Mills theories with 8 supercharges in
various dimensions. In particular, we present a dual to N=2 SU(N) SYM theory in
3+1 dimensions, and analyse some aspects of the duality.
