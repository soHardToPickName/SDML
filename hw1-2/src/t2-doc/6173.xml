Topological aspects of Abelian gauge theory in superfield formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some aspects of the topological features of a non-interacting two
(1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory in the framework of superfield
formalism. This theory is described by a BRST invariant Lagrangian density in
the Feynman gauge. We express the local and continuous symmetries, Lagrangian
density, topological invariants and symmetric energy momentum tensor of this
theory in the language of superfields by exploiting the nilpotent (anti-)BRST-
and (anti-)co-BRST symmetries. In particular, the Lagrangian density and
symmetric energy momentum tensor of this topological theory turn out to be the
sum of terms that geometrically correspond to the translations of some local
superfields along the Grassmannian directions of the four (2+2)-dimensional
supermanifold. In this interpretation, the (anti-)BRST- and (anti-)co-BRST
symmetries, that emerge after the imposition of the (dual) horizontality
conditions, play a very important role.
