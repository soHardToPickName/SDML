Fine-Tuning Renormalization and Two-particle States in Nonrelativistic
  Four-fermion Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Various exact solutions of two-particle eigenvalue problems for
nonrelativistic contact four-fermion current-current interaction are obtained.
Specifics of Goldstone mode is investigated. The connection between a
renormalization procedure and construction of self-adjoint extensions is
revealed.
