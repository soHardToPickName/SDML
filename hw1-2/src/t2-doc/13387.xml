Separation of Variables and Vacuum Structure of N=2 SUSY QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the method of separation of variables can be used to construct
integrable models corresponding to curves describing vacuum structure of
four-dimensional ${\cal N} = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theories. We use this technique
to construct models corresponding to $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory with $N_f<2N$
matter hypermultiplets by generalising the periodic Toda lattice. We also show
that some special cases of massive $SU(3)$ gauge theory can be equivalently
described by the generalisations of the Goryachev-Chaplygin top obtained via
separation of variables.
