N- and 1-time Classical Description of N-body Relativistic Kinematics
  and the Electromagnetic Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  The intrinsic covariant 1-time description (rest-frame instant form) for N
relativistic scalar particles is defined. The system of N charged scalar
particles plus the electromagnetic field is described in this way: the study of
its Dirac observables allows the extraction of the Coulomb potential from field
theory and the regularization of the classical self-energy by using
Grassmann-valued electric charges. The 1-time covariant relativistic
statistical mechanics is defined.
