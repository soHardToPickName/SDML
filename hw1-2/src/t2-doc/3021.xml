Note on thermodynamic fermion loop under constant magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective potential of a thermodynamic fermion loop under
constant magnetic field is studied. As expected, it can be interpreted
literally as a discretized sum of $(D-2)$-dimensional energy density above the
Dirac sea. Large/small mass expansions of the potential are also examined.
