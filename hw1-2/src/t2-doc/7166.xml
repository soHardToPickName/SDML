Higgs Mechanism with a Topological Term
</title>

<abstract>
  In cases of both abelian and nonabelian gauge groups, we consider the Higgs
mechanism in topologically massive gauge theories in an arbitrary space-time
dimension. It is shown that the presence of a topological term makes it
possible to shift mass of gauge fields in a nontrivial way compared to the
conventional value at the classical tree level. We correct the previous
misleading statement with respect to the counting of physical degrees of
freedom, where it is shown that gauge fields become massive by 'eating' the
Nambu-Goldstone boson and a higher-rank tensor field, but a new massless scalar
appears in the spectrum so the number of the physical degrees of freedom
remains unchanged before and after the spontaneous symmetry breakdown. Some
related phenomenological implications and applications to superstring theory
are briefly commented.
