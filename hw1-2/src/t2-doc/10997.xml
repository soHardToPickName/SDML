Spacetime locality of the antifield formalism : a "mise au point"
</title>

<abstract>
  Some general techniques and theorems on the spacetime locality of the
antifield formalism are illustrated in the familiar cases of the free scalar
field, electromagnetism and Yang-Mills theory. The analysis explicitly shows
that recent criticisms of the usual approach to dealing with locality are
ill-founded.
