Some Observations on Non-covariant Gauges and the epsilon-term
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Lagrangian path-integrals in Minkowski space for gauges with
a residual gauge-invariance. From rather elementary considerations, we
demonstrate the necessity of inclusion of an epsilon-term (even) in the formal
treatments, without which one may reach incorrect conclusions. We show,
further, that the epsilon-term can contribute to the BRST WT-identities in a
nontrivial way (even as epsilon-->0). We also show that the (expectation value
of the) correct epsilon-term satisfies an algebraic condition. We show by
considering (a commonly used) example of a simple local quadratic epsilon
-term, that they lead to additional constraints on Green's function that are
not normally taken into account in the BRST formalism that ignores the
epsilon-term, and that they are characteristic of the way the singularities in
propagators are handled. We argue that for a subclass of these gauges, the
Minkowski path-integral could not be obtained by a Wick rotation from a
Euclidean path-integral.
