Transition Amplitudes within the Stochastic Quantization Scheme
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum mechanical transition amplitudes are calculated within the stochastic
quantization scheme for the free nonrelativistic particle, the harmonic
oscillator and the nonrelativistic particle in a constant magnetic field; we
close with free Grassmann quantum mechanics.
