On Superpotential and BPS domain wall in SQCD and MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the decoupling properties of the N=2 SQCD vacua when the adjoint
mass term is turned on and then the N=1 limit is taken. The BPS domain wall
tension in N=1 MQCD and SQCD is also examined. The correspondence of the MQCD
integrals with the superpotential and the gaugino condensate is shown.
