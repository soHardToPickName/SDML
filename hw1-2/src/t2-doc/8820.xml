Gauge Theory Model -- quark dynamics and anti-ferromagnets
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional QED with N-flavor fermions serves as a model of quark
dynamics in QCD as well as an effective theory of an anti-ferromagnetic spin
chain. It is reduced to N-degree quantum mechanics in which a potential is
self-consistently determined by the Schr\"odinger equation itself.
