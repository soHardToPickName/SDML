Remarks on Topological SUSY in sixdimensional TQFTs
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish the existence of the topological vector supersymmetry in the six
dimensional topological field theory for two-form fields introduced by Baulieu
and West. We investigate the relation of these symmetries to the twist
operation for the (2,0) supersymmetry and comment on their resemblance to the
analogous symmetries in topological Yang-Mills theory.
