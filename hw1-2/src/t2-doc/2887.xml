Cellular Networks as Models for Planck-Scale Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the working hypothesis that both physics and the corresponding
mathematics have to be described by means of discrete concepts on the Planck
scale, one of the many problems one has to face in this enterprise is to find
the discrete protoforms of the building blocks of our ordinary continuum
physics and mathematics. We base our own approach on what we call `cellular
networks', consisting of cells (nodes) interacting with each other via bonds
(figuring as elementary interactions) according to a certain `local law'.
Geometrically our dynamical networks are living on graphs. Hence a substantial
amount of the investigation is devoted to the developement of various versions
of discrete (functional) analysis and geometry on such (almost random) webs.
Another important topic we address is a suitable concept of intrinsic (fractal)
dimension on erratic structures of this kind. In the course of the
investigation we make comments concerning both different and related approaches
to quantum gravity as, say, the spin network framework. It may perhaps be said
that certain parts of our programme seem to be a realisation of ideas sketched
by Smolin some time ago (see the introduction).
