Electric Black Holes in Type 0 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss AdS_{2+1} (BTZ) black holes arising in type 0 string theory
corresponding to D1-D5 and F1-NS5 bound states. In particular we describe a new
family of non-dilatonic solutions with only Dp_{+}, that is ``electric''
branes. These solutions are distinguished by the absence of fermions in the
world volume theory which is an interacting CFT. They can not be obtained as a
projection of a type II BPS-configuration. As for previous type 0 backgrounds
linear stability is guaranteed only if the curvature is of the order of the
string scale where alpha' corrections cannot be excluded. Some problems
concerning the counting of states are discussed.
