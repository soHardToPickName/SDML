On the Operator Product Expansion in Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the mixing of UV and IR effects, we test the OPE formula in
noncommutative field theory. First we look at the renormalization of local
composite operators, identifying some of their characteristic IR/UV
singularities. Then we find that the product of two fields in general cannot be
described by a series expansion of single local operator insertions.
