Complex Monopoles and Gribov Copies
</title>

<abstract>
  Complex monopole solutions exist in the three dimensional Georgi-Glashow
model with the Chern-Simons term. They dominate the path integral and disorder
the Higgs vacuum. Gribov copies of the vacuum and monopole configurations are
studied in detail.
