Intrinsic anyonic spin through deformed geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of the deformed bosonic oscillator, and the quantum groups
${\cal U}_q(SL(2))$ and $GL_q(2)$ in the limit as their deformation parameter
$q$ goes to a root of unity are investigated and interpreted physically. These
properties are seen to be related to fractional supersymmetry and intrinsic
anyonic spin. A simple deformation of the Klein-Gordon equation is introduced,
based on $GL_q(2)$. When $q$ is a root of unity this equation is a root of the
undeformed Klein-Gordon equation.
