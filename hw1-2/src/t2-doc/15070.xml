Illusory Quantum Hair
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the quantum hair model proposed recently by Coleman,
  Preskill and Wilczek. We give arguments suggesting that the potential hair is
expected to be destroyed by the instability of the black-hole. We also discuss
the general implications of such arguments on the prospects for formulating a
quantum extension of the classical ``no hair'' theorems.
