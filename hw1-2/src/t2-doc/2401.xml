The Paradox of Virtual Dipoles in the Einstein Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The functional integral of pure Einstein 4D quantum gravity admits abnormally
large and long-lasting "dipolar fluctuations", generated by virtual sources
with the property Int d^4x Sqrt{g(x)} Tr T(x) = 0. These fluctuations would
exist also at macroscopic scales, with paradoxical consequences. We set out
their general features and give numerical estimates of possible suppression
processes.
