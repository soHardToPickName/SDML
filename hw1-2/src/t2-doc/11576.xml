UV-IR coupling in higher derivative gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possible existence of new generic vacuum solutions of
Robertson-Walker form in higher derivative gravity theories in four dimensions.
These solutions illustrate how a dynamical coupling between very low and very
high frequency modes can occur when the cosmological constant is small.
