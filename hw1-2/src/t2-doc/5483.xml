Spacetime Quotients, Penrose Limits and Conformal Symmetry Restoration
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the Penrose limit of AdS_5 orbifolds. The orbifold can
be either in the pure spatial directions or space and time directions. For the
AdS_5/\Gamma\times S^5 spatial orbifold we observe that after the Penrose limit
we obtain the same result as the Penrose limit of AdS_5\times S^5/\Gamma. We
identify the corresponding BMN operators in terms of operators of the gauge
theory on R\times S^3/\Gamma. The semi-classical description of rotating
strings in these backgrounds have also been studied. For the spatial AdS
orbifold we show that in the quadratic order the obtained action for the
fluctuations is the same as that in S^5 orbifold, however, the higher loop
correction can distinguish between two cases.
