Toda lattice field theories, discrete W algebras, Toda lattice
  hierarchies and quantum groups

  In analogy with the Liouville case we study the $sl_3$ Toda theory on the
lattice and define the relevant quadratic algebra and out of it we recover the
discrete $W_3$ algebra. We define an integrable system with respect to the
latter and establish the relation with the Toda lattice hierarchy. We compute
the the relevant continuum limits. Finally we find the quantum version of the
quadratic algebra.
