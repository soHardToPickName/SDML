On Quantum Radiation in Curved Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of quantum field theories for fermions and bosons in curved
spacetime, we compute the effective action of the transition amplitude from
vacuum to vacuum in the presence of an external gravitational field. The
imaginary part of resulted effective action determines the probability of
vacuum decay via quantum tunneling process, giving the rate and spectrum of
particle creations. On the basis that gravitational field polarizes vacuum and
discretizes its spectrum, we discuss the quantum origin of such a tunneling
effect and spectrum of particle creations.
