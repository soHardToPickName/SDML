Kaluza-Klein theory, AdS/CFT correspondence and black hole entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  The asymptotic symmetries of the near-horizon geometry of a lifted
(near-extremal) Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, obtained by inverting the
Kaluza-Klein reduction, explain the deviation of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
from extremality. We point out the fact that the extra dimension allows us to
justify the use of a Virasoro mode decomposition along the time-like boundary
of the near-horizon geometry, AdS$_2\times$S$^n$, of the lower-dimensional
(Reissner-Nordstrom) spacetime.
