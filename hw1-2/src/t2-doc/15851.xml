Quantum Poisson-Lie T-duality and WZNW model
</title>

<abstract>
  A pair of conformal sigma models related by Poisson-Lie T-duality is
constructed by starting with the O(2,2) Drinfeld double. The duality relates
the standard SL(2,R) WZNW model to a constrained sigma model defined on SL(2,R)
group space. The quantum equivalence of the models is established by using a
path integral argument.
