A two point function in a cascading N=1 gauge theory from supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the two point correlation function of a dimension 4 operator in a
nonconformal cascading N=1 SUSY gauge theory using the supergravity dual found
by Klebanov and Strassler[hep-th/0007191]. The two point function has a
logarithmic correction to conformal behavior which is related to the scale
dependence of the effective number of colors. The nonsingular behavior of this
correlator suggests that the theory remains a local 4-dimensional quantum field
theory at all scales. We also compute the spectrum of low-lying glueball modes
corresponding to the above operator.
