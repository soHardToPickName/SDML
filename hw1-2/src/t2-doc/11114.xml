A class of two-dimensional Yang-Mills vacua and their relation to the
  non-linear sigma model
</title>

  Classical vacuum - pure gauge - solutions of Euclidean two-dimensional SU(2)
Yang-Mills theories are studied. Topologically non-trivial vacua are found in a
class of gauge group elements isomorphic to $S_2$. These solutions are
unexpectedly related to the solution of the non-linear O(3) model and to the
motion of a particle in a periodic potential.
