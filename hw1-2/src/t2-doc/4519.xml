A semi-classical limit of the gauge/string correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  A world-sheet sigma model approach is applied to string theories dual to
four-dimensional gauge theories, and semi-classical soliton solutions
representing highly excited string states are identified which correspond to
gauge theory operators with relatively small anomalous dimensions. The simplest
class of such states are strings on the leading Regge trajectory, with large
spin in AdS_5. These correspond to operators with many covariant derivatives,
whose anomalous dimension grows logarithmically with the space-time spin. In
the gauge theory, the logarithmic scaling violations are similar to those found
in perturbation theory. Other examples of highly excited string states are also
considered.
