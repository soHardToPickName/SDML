Anomalies from Immersions
</title>

<abstract>
  Two forms of anomalies for chiral spinors living on submanifolds of the
spacetime are obtained from the integrality theorem for immersions. The first
form of the chiral anomaly is the usual for chiral spinors living on D-brane
and O-plane intersections, the second form is exotic.
