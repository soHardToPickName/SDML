Description of Intersecting Branes via Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a model describing BPS brane-systems using low energy effective
theory of brane-antibrane system. Both parallel branes and intersecting branes
can be treated by this model. After tachyon condensation, the dynamics of
fluctuations around such brane-systems is supersymmetric if the degrees of
freedom are restricted on the branes. The form of the tachyon potential and the
application of this model to the black hole physics are discussed.
