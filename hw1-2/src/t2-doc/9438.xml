Null orbifolds in AdS, Time Dependence and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  We study M/D-branes in a null-brane background. By taking a near horizon
limit, one is left with cosmological models in the corresponding Poincar\'e
patches. To deal with their usual horizons, we either extend these models to
global AdS or remain in the Poincar\'e patch and apply a T-duality
transformation whenever the effective radius of the compact dimension
associated with the null-brane probes distances smaller than the string scale.
The first scenario gives rise to null orbifolds in AdS spaces, which are
described in detail. Their conformal boundaries are singular. The second has a
dual gauge theory description in terms of Super Yang-Mills in the null-brane
background. The latter is a good candidate for a non-perturbative definition of
string theory in a time-dependent background.
