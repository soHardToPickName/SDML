Massive current algebra in the many-flavor chiral Gross-Neveu model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the algebra of SU(n)-currents in the many-flavor chiral Gross-Neveu
model. The general structure of the current-current OPE leading to non-local
quantum conserved charges is reviewed. We calculate the OPE in the one-flavor
and the many-flavor models perturbatively and use renormalization group
invariance to prove that our results are not altered by higher-order
corrections. We conclude that in these models the non-local quantum charge
exists which is the first step towards the proof of the absence of particle
production and factorization.
