Super Virasoro Ghost Algebra using the Conformal Ghosts
</title>

<abstract>
  Superconformal ghost current generators of conformal dimension 3/2 are
constructed using the conformal ghosts and anticommuting infinite dimensional
gamma matrices of the Clifford algebra. The super-Virasoro algebra for the
ghosts in both the N.S. and R sectors are presented. The anomaly terms in both
cases are deduced using Jacobi identity.
