$M$-theory Compactification and Two-brane/Five-brane Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various dual {\it pairs} of $M$-theory compactifications. Each
pair consists of a compactification in which the two-brane plays the crucial
role in relation to a string theory and a compactification in which the
five-brane takes center stage. We show that in many examples such dual pairs
are interchanged by the {\it same} duality transformation in each case.
