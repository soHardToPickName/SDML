On the finiteness of a new topological model in D=3
</title>

<abstract>
  A new topological model is proposed in three dimensions as an extension of
the BF-model. It is a three-dimensional counterpart of the two-dimensional
model introduced by Chamseddine and Wyler ten years ago. The BFK-model, as we
shall call it, shows to be quantum scale invariant at all orders in
perturbation theory. The proof of its full finiteness is given in the framework
of algebraic renormalization.
