Type II Theories Compactified on Calabi-Yau Threefolds in the Presence
  of Background Fluxes
</title>

<abstract>
  Compactifications of type II theories on Calabi-Yau threefolds including
electric and magnetic background fluxes are discussed. We derive the bosonic
part of the four-dimensional low energy effective action and show that it is a
non-canonical N=2 supergravity which includes a massive two-form. The
symplectic invariance of the theory is maintained as long as the flux
parameters transform as a symplectic vector and a massive two-form which
couples to both electric and magnetic field strengths is present. The mirror
symmetry between type IIA and type IIB compactified on mirror manifolds is
shown to hold for R-R fluxes at the level of the effective action. We also
compactify type IIA in the presence of NS three-form flux but the mirror
symmetry in this case remains unclear.
