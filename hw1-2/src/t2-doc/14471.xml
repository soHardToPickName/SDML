The Nambu-Goto Theory of Closed Bosonic Strings Moving in
  1+3-Dimensional Minkowski Space: The Quantum Algebra of Observables
</title>

<abstract>
  A relevant part of the quantum algebra of observables for the closed bosonic
strings moving in 1+3-dimensional Minkowski space is presented in the form of
generating relations involving still one, as yet undetermined, real free
parameter.
