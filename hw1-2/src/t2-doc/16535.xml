Creation of Strings in D-particle Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  D-particle quantum mechanics in a type I' background is reviewed. It is also
discussed how a string is created when a D-particle is taken through a
D8-brane. The process is found to be dual to the creation of a D3-brane when a
NS5 and D5 brane are passed through each other.
