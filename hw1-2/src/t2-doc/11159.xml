Spontaneous Parity Violation in QCD At Finite Temperature: On the
  Inapplicability of the Vafa-Witten Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalization of the Vafa-Witten theorem ruling out parity violation to
QCD at finite temperature is considered. It is shown that this generalization
of the theorem rules out Lorentz-invariant parity violating operators from
spontaneously acquiring vacuum expectation values. However, it does not rule
out Lorentz-noninvariant parity-violating operators from acquiring expectation
values. Other situations where the theorem is inapplicable are also discussed.
