Non-critical type 0 string theories and their field theory duals
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we continue the study of the non-critical type 0 string and its
field theory duals. We begin by reviewing some facts and conjectures about
these theories. We move on to our proposal for the type 0 effective action in
any dimension, its RR fields and their Chern--Simons couplings. We then focus
on the case without compact dimensions and study its field theory duals. We
show that one can parameterize all dual physical quantities in terms of a
finite number of unknown parameters. By making some further assumptions on the
tachyon couplings, one can still make some ``model independent'' statements.
