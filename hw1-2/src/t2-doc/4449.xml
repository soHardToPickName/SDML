On the Three-dimensional Lattice Model
</title>

<abstract>
Using the restricted star-triangle relation, it is shown that the $N$-state
spin integrable model on a three-dimensional lattice with spins interacting
round each elementary cube of the lattice proposed by Mangazeev, Sergeev and
Stroganov is a particular case of the Bazhanov-Baxter model.
