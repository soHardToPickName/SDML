On Metric Perturbations in Brane-World Scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we reconsider linearised metric perturbations in the one-brane
Randall-Sundrum Model. We present a simple formalism to describe metric
perturbations caused by matter perturbations on the brane and remedy some
misconceptions concerning the constraints imposed on the metric and matter
perturbations by the presence of the brane.
