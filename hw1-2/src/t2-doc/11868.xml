The Mathematics of Fivebranes
</title>

<abstract>
  Fivebranes are non-perturbative objects in string theory that generalize
two-dimensional conformal field theory and relate such diverse subjects as
moduli spaces of vector bundles on surfaces, automorphic forms, elliptic
genera, the geometry of Calabi-Yau threefolds, and generalized Kac-Moody
algebras.
