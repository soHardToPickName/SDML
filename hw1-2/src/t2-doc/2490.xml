The chiral WZNW phase space as a quasi-Poisson space
</title>

<abstract>
  It is explained that the chiral WZNW phase space is a quasi-Poisson space
with respect to the `canonical' Lie quasi-bialgebra which is the classical
limit of Drinfeld's quasi-Hopf deformation of the universal enveloping algebra.
This exemplifies the notion of quasi-Poisson-Lie symmetry introduced recently
by Alekseev and Kosmann-Schwarzbach, and also permits us to generalize certain
dynamical twists considered previously in this example.
