Spacelike Singularities and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An interpretation of spacelike singularities in string theory uses target
space duality to relate the collapsing Schwarzschild geometry near the
singularity to an inflationary cosmology in dual variables. An appealing
picture thus results whereby gravitational collapse seeds the formation of a
new universe.
