Super W-Symmetries, Covariantly Constant Forms And Duality
  Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  On a supersymmetric sigma model the covariantly constant forms are related to
the conserved currents that are generators of a super W-algebra extending the
superconformal algebra. The existence of covariantly constant forms restricts
the holonomy group of the manifold. Via duality transformation we get new
covariantly constant forms, thus restricting the holonomy group of the new
manifold.
