Introducing Quarks in Confining Strings via the Fermionic Wilson Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  In the world line representation of the fermionic effective action for QCD
the interaction between Fermions and the gauge field is contained in the
fermionic Wilson loop, namely the Wilson loop for a spin-half particle. It is
argued that a string representation of the fermionic Wilson loop can provide a
link connecting QCD with a dual description of a meson as a quark and an
antiquark connected by a string. This is illustrated by obtaining such a
representation in compact U(1) gauge theories. The resulting description
contains information about the interaction of the spin of the quark with the
world sheet degrees of freedom. Such interactions may be of importance in the
realization of chiral symmetry in the string picture of QCD, and for
delineating the possible presence of a world sheet supersymmetry in QCD
strings.
