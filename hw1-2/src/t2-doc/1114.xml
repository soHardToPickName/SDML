Foundations of Rational Quantum Field Theory, I
</title>

<abstract>
  The connection between Rational Conformal Field Theory (RCFT), $N=2$ massive
supersymmetric field theory, and solvable Interaction Round the Face (IRF)
lattice models is explored here. Specifically, one identifies the fusion rings
with the chiral rings. The theories so obtained are conjectured, and largely
shown, to be integrable. A variety of examples and the structure of the metric
in moduli space are given. The kink scattering theory is given by the Boltzmann
weights of an IRF model, which is built entirely in terms of the conformal data
of the original RCFT. This procedure produces all solvable IRF models in terms
of projection operators of the RCFT. The soliton structure and their scattering
amplitudes are described. A host of new rational conformal field theories are
constructed generalizing most, if not all, of the known ones.
