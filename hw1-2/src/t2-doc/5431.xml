Super-Matrix KdV and Super-Generalized NS Equations from Self-Dual
  Yang-Mills Systems with Supergauge Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Super-matrix KdV and super-generalized non-linear Schrodinger equations are
shown to arise from a symmetry reduction of ordinary self-dual Yang-Mills
equations with supergauge groups
