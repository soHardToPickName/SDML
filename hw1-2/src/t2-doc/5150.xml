Reconstructing the Vacuum Functional of Yang-Mills from its Large
  Distance Behaviour
</title>

<abstract>
  For fields that vary slowly on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithm
of the vacuum functional can be expanded as a sum of local functionals. For
Yang-Mills theory the leading term in the expansion dominates large distance
effects and leads to an area law for the Wilson loop. However, this expansion
cannot be expected to converge for fields that vary more rapidly. By studying
the analyticity of the vacuum functional under scale transformations we show
how to re-sum this series so as to reconstruct the vacuum functional for
arbitrary fields.
