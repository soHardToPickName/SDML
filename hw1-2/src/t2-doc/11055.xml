The Energy-Momentum Tensor in Fulling-Rindler Vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  The energy density in Fulling-Rindler vacuum, which is known to be negative
"everywhere" is shown to be positive and singular on the horizons in such a
fashion as to guarantee the positivity of the total energy. The mechanism of
compensation is displayed in detail.
