Strings, Unification and dilaton/moduli-induced SUSY-breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss several issues concerning the use of string models as unified
theories of all interactions. After a short review of gauge coupling
unification in the string context, I discuss possible motivations for the
construction of $SU(5)$ and $SO(10)$ String-GUTs. I describe the construction
of such String-GUTs using different orbifold techniques and emphasize those
properties which could be general. Although $SO(10)$ and $SU(5)$ String-GUTs
are relatively easy to build, the spectrum bellow the GUT scale is in general
bigger than that of the MSSM and includes colour octets and $SU(2)$ triplets.
The phenomenological prospects of these theories are discussed. I then turn to
discuss soft SUSY-breaking terms obtained under the assumption of
dilaton/moduli dominance in SUSY-breaking string schemes. I underline the
unique finiteness pr of the soft terms induced by the dilaton sector. These
improved finiteness properties seem to be related to the underlying $SU(1,1)$
structure of the dilaton couplings. I conclude with an outlook and some
speculations regarding $N=1$ duality.
