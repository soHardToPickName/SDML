Factorization method and the supersymmetric monopole harmonics
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the general $N = 1$ supersymmetric formulation of one dimensional
sigma models on non trivial manifolds and its subsequent quantization to
formulate the classical and quantum dynamics of the $ N= 2 $ supersymmetric
charged particle moving on a sphere in the field of a monopole. The
factorization method accommodated with the general covariance and it is used to
integrate the corresponding system.
