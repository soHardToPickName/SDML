Singular Limits and String Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that new leading ($\al'$) as well as all-order solutions of
String theory can be obtained by taking appropriate singular limits of the
known solutions. We give several leading order solutions for the bosonic as
well as the heterotic string. We then present all-order forms of the previously
known two dimensional cosmological solutions. An all-order form for the
cosmological solution in three dimensions is also predicted. The physical
implications of our results are discussed.
