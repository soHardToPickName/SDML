(1 + p)-Dimensional Open D(p - 2) Brane Theories

<abstract>
  The dynamics of a Dp brane can be described either by an open string ending
on this brane or by an open D(p - 2) brane ending on the same Dp brane. The
ends of the open string couple to a Dp brane worldvolume gauge field while the
boundary of the open D(p - 2) brane couples to a (p - 2)-form worldvolume
potential whose field strength is Poincare dual to that of the gauge field on
the Dp-brane worldvolume. With this in mind, we find that the Poincare dual of
the fixed rank-2 magnetic field used in defining a (1 + p)-dimensional
noncommutative Yang-Mills (NCYM) gives precisely a near-critical electric field
for the open D(p - 2) brane. We therefore find (1 + p)-dimensional open D(p -
2) brane theories along the same line as for obtaining noncommutative open
string theories (NCOS), OM theory and open Dp brane theories (ODp) from NS5
brane. Similarly, the Poincare dual of the near-critical electric field used in
defining a (1 + p)-dimensional NCOS gives a fixed magnetic-like field. This
field along with the same bulk field scalings defines a (1 + p)-dimensional
noncommutative field theory. In the same spirit, we can have various (1 +
5)-dimensional noncommutative field theories resulting from the existence of
ODp if the description of open D(4 - p) brane ending on the NS5 brane is
insisted.
