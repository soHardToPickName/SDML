Coordinate-Free Quantization of Second-Class Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The conversion of second-class constraints into first-class constraints is
used to extend the coordinate-free path integral quantization, achieved by a
flat-space Brownian motion regularization of the coherent-state path integral
measure, to systems with second-class constraints.
