A Worldsheet Description of Planar Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend previous work by developing a worldsheet description of non-abelian
gauge theory (Yang-Mills). This task requires the introduction of Grassmann
variables on the world sheet analogous to those of the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond
formulation of string theory. A highlight of our construction is that once the
three gluon vertices of Yang-Mills Feynman diagrams are given a worldsheet
description, the worldsheet formalism automatically produces all of the quartic
vertices.
