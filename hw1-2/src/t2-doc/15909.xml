More on Four-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an embedding of the extremal four-dimensional
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole into type $IIB$ string theory. The equivalent
type $IIB$ configuration, in the D-brane weak-coupling picture, is a bound
state of D1- and D5-branes threaded by fundamental type $IIB$ strings. The
bound state involves also a NSNS solitonic 5-brane, mimicking the role of the
Kaluza-Klein magnetic monopole. The statistical entropy derived by counting the
degeneracy of the BPS-saturated excitations of this bound state agrees
perfectly with the (semiclassical) Bekenstein-Hawking formula.
