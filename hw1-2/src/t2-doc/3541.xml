Mirror Maps and Instanton Sums for Complete Intersections in Weighted
  Projective Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a class of Calabi-Yau compactifications which are constructed as
a complete intersection in weighted projective space. For manifolds with one
K\"ahler modulus we construct the mirror manifolds and calculate the instanton
sum.
