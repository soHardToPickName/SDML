Fusion of Dilute $A_L$ Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The fusion procedure is implemented for the dilute $A_L$ lattice models and a
fusion hierarchy of functional equations with an $su(3)$ structure is derived
for the fused transfer matrices. We also present the Bethe ansatz equations for
the dilute $A_L$ lattice models and discuss their connection with the fusion
hierarchy. The solution of the fusion hierarchy for the eigenvalue spectra of
the dilute $A_L$ lattice models will be presented in a subsequent paper.
