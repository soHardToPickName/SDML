Polyakov conjecture and 2+1 dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  After briefly reviewing the hamiltonian approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity
in absence of matter on closed universes, we consider 2+1 dimensional gravity
coupled to point particles in an open universe. We show that the hamiltonian
structure of the theory is the result of a conjecture put forward by Polyakov
in a different context. A proof is given of such a conjecture. Finally we give
the exact quantization of the two particle problem in open space.
