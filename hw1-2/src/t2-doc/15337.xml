Classical integrability of chiral $QCD_{2}$ and classical curves
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter, classical chiral $QCD_{2}$ is studied in the lightcone gauge
$A_{-}=0$. The once integrated equation of motion for the current is shown to
be of the Lax form, which demonstrates an infinite number of conserved
quantities. Specializing to gauge group SU(2), we show that solutions to the
classical equations of motion can be identified with a very large class of
curves. We demonstrate this correspondence explicitly for two solutions. The
classical fermionic fields associated with these currents are then obtained.
