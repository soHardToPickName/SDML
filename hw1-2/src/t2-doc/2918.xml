Non-Commutative Geometry and Chiral Perturbation Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral perturbation lagrangian in the framework of non-commutative geometry
is considered in full detail. It is found that the explicit symmetry breaking
terms appear and some relations between the coupling constants of the theory
come out naturally. The WZW term also turns up on the same footing as the other
terms of the chiral lagrangian.
