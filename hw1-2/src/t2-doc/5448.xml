Higher-derivative terms in one-loop effective action for general
  trajectories of D-particles in Matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective action for general trajectories of D-particles in
Matrix theory is calculated in the expansion with respect to the number of
derivatives up to six, which gives the equation of motion consistently. The
result shows that the terms with six derivatives vanish for straight-line
trajectories, however, they do not vanish in general. This provides a concrete
example that non-renormalization of twelve-fermion terms does not necessarily
imply that of six-derivative terms.
