The microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator with finite quark
  masses
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the microscopic spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator in the presence
of dynamical fermions in the framework of random-matrix theory for the chiral
Gaussian unitary ensemble. We obtain results for the microscopic spectral
correlators, the microscopic spectral density, and the distribution of the
smallest eigenvalue for an arbitrary number of flavors, arbitrary quark masses,
and arbitrary topological charge.
