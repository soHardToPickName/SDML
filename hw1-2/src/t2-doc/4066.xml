Branes at angles and calibrated geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper, Ohta and Townsend studied the conditions which must be
satisfied for a configuration of two intersecting M5-branes at angles to be
supersymmetric. In this paper we extend this result to any number of M5-branes
or any number of M2-branes. This is accomplished by interpreting their results
in terms of calibrated geometry, which is of independent interest.
