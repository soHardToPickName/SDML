Light-Cone Quantization of the Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider constructing a canonical quantum theory of the light-cone gauge
($A_-$=0) Schwinger model in the light-cone representation. Quantization
conditions are obtained by requiring that translational generators $P_+$ and
$P_-$ give rise to Heisenberg equations which, in a physical subspace, are
consistant with the field equations. A consistent operator solution with
residual gauge degrees of freedom is obtained by solving initial value problems
on the light-cones. The construction allows a parton picture although we have a
physical vacuum with nontrivial degeneracies in the theory.
