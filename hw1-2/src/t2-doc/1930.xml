Black Holes in brane worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  In a Randall-Sundrum theory (RS1) 3+1 dimensional black holes and higher
dimensional black holes are not the natural continuations of each other. 3+1
dimensional black holes decay into a large number of 4+1 dimensional black
holes at a critical mass, $M_{\rm crit}\sim 10^{32}$ TeV. Those black holes
themselves may become unstable above another, albeit much smaller critical
mass, $M_0\sim 10^3$TeV.
