A Regularization Scheme for the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  The prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence is refined by using a
regularization procedure, which makes is possible to calculate the divergent
local terms in the CFT two-point function. We present the procedure for the
example of the scalar field.
