Jacobians of chiral transformations and two-dimensional bosonization
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a complete path integral bosonization procedure for any
fermionic theory in two dimensions. The method works equally well for massive
and massless fermions, and is a generalization of an approach suggested earlier
by Andrianov. The classical action of the bosons in the bosonized theory is
identified with -i times the logarithm of the Jacobian of a local chiral
transformation, with the boson fields as transformation parameters. Three
examples, the Schwinger model, the massive Thirring model and massive
non-Abelian bosonization, are worked out.
