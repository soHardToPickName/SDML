On Branes Ending on Branes in Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the eleven-dimensional supergravity and the classical solutions
corresponding to M2-branes ending on M5-branes. We obtain the generic BPS
configuration representing two sets of parallel M5-branes with (1+1) commonly
longitudinal directions and M2-branes stretching between them. We also discuss
how the brane creation is described in supergravity.
