A truly marginal deformation of SL(2,R) in a null direction
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a marginal deformation of the SL(2,R) WZW model in a null
direction. If we send the deformation parameter to infinity we obtain a linear
dilaton background plus two free bosons. We show in addition that such a
background can be obtained by a duality transformation of the undeformed WZW
model. In the end we indicate how to generalize the given procedure.
