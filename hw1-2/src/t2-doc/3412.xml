On Brane World Cosmological Perturbations
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the scalar cosmological perturbations in a 3-brane world with a 5D
bulk. We first show explicitly how the effective perturbed Einstein's equations
on the brane (involving the Weyl fluid) are encoded into Mukohyama's master
equation. We give the relation between Mukohyama's master variable and the
perturbations of the Weyl fluid, we also discuss the relation between the
former and the perturbations of matter and induced metric on the brane. We show
that one can obtain a boundary condition on the brane for the master equation
solely expressible in term of the master variable, in the case of a perfect
fluid with adiabatic perturbations on a Randall-Sundrum (RS) or
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) brane. This provides an easy way to solve
numerically for the evolution of the perturbations as well as should shed light
on the various approximations done in the literature to deal with the Weyl
degrees of freedom.
