The Reeh-Schlieder property for thermal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Reeh-Schlieder property w.r.t. the KMS-vector is a direct
consequence of locality, additivity and the relativistic KMS-condition. The
latter characterises the thermal equilibrium states of a relativistic quantum
field theory. The statement remains vaild even if the given equilibrium state
breaks spatial translation invariance.
