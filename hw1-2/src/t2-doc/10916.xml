Nonpolynomial gauge invariant interactions of 1-form and 2-form gauge
  potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  A four dimensional gauge theory with nonpolynomial but local interactions of
1-form and 2-form gauge potentials is constructed. The model is a nontrivial
deformation of a free gauge theory with nonpolynomial dependence on the
deformation parameter (= gauge coupling constant).
