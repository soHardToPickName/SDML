Dirac Quantization Gravity-Yang-Mills Systems in 1+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In two dimensions a large class of gravitational systems including, e.g.,
$R^2$-gravity can be quantized exactly also when coupled dynamically to a
Yang-Mills theory. Some previous considerations on the quantization of pure
gravity theories are improved and generalized.
