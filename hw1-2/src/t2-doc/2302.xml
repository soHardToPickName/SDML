Supersymmetric webs of D3/D5-branes in supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study webs of D3- and D5-branes in type IIB supergravity. These webs
preserve at least 8 supercharges. By solving the Killing spinor equations we
determine the form of supergravity solutions for the system. We then turn to
the sub-class of the intersecting D3/D5 brane system and elucidate some of its
features.
