Towards the low energy effective degrees of freedom in N=2 SUSY
  theories: branes and integrability
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the brane interpretation of the integrable dynamics behind the
exact solution to the N=2 SUSY YM theory. Degrees of freedom in the first
integrable system responsible for the spectral Riemann surfaces comes from the
hidden Higgs branch of the moduli space. The second integrable system of the
Whitham type yields the dynamics on the Coulomb branch and can be considered as
the scattering of branes.
