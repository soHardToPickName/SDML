Bethe Ansatz Equations for the Broken $Z_{N}$-Symmetric Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the Bethe Ansatz equations for the broken ${\bf Z}_{N}$-symmetric
model by constructing a functional relation of the transfer matrix of
$L$-operators. This model is an elliptic off-critical extension of the
Fateev-Zamolodchikov model. We calculate the free energy of this model on the
basis of the string hypothesis.
