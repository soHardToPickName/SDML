Coupling Nonlinear Sigma-Models to Relaxed Yang- Mills Supermultiplets
  in (2,0)-Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  Following a previous work on Abelian (2,0)-gauge theories, one reassesses
here the task of coupling (2,0) relaxed Yang-Mills superpotentials to a (2,0)-
nonlinear $\sigma$-model, by gauging the isotropy or the isometry group of the
latter. One pays special attention to the extra ``chiral-like'' component-field
gauge potential that comes out from the relaxation of superspace constraints.
