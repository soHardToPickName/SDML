Semiclassical zero temperature black holes in spherically reduced
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We numerically integrate the semiclassical equations of motion for
spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell theory with a dilaton coupled scalar
field and look for zero temperature configurations. The solution we find is
studied in detail close to the horizon and comparison is made with the
corresponding one in the minimally coupled case.
