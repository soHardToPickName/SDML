Black Hole Evaporation. A Survey
</title>

<abstract>
  This thesis is a review of black hole evaporation with emphasis on recent
results obtained for two dimensional black holes. First, the geometry of the
most general stationary black hole in four dimensions is described and some
classical quantities are defined. Then, a derivation of the spectrum of the
radiation emitted during the evaporation is presented. In section four, a two
dimensional model which has black hole solutions is introduced, the so-called
CGHS model. These two dimensional black holes are found to evaporate. Unlike
the four dimensional case, the evaporation process can be studied analytically
as long as the mass of the black hole is well above the two dimensional analog
of the Planck mass. Finally, some proposals for resolving the so-called
information paradox are reviewed and it is concluded that none of them is fully
satisfactory.
