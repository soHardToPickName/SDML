Fusion and Analytical Bethe Ansatz for the $A_{\n-1}^{(1)}$ Open Spin
  Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalise the fusion procedure for the $A_{\n-1}^{(1)}$ open spin chain
($\n>2$) and we show that the transfer matrix satisfies a crossing property. We
use these results to solve the $A_{\n-1}^{(1)}$ open spin chain with $U_{q}
(SU(\n))$ symmetry by means of the analytical Bethe ansatz method. Our results
coincide with the known ones obtained by means of the nested Bethe ansatz.
