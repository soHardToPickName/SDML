Recent Progress in Irrational Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk, I will review the foundations of irrational conformal field
theory (ICFT), which includes rational conformal field theory as a small
subspace. Highlights of the review include the Virasoro master equation, the
Ward identities for the correlators of ICFT and solutions of the Ward
identities. In particular, I will discuss the solutions for the correlators of
the $g/h$ coset constructions and the correlators of the affine-Sugawara nests
on $g\supset h_1 \supset \ldots \supset h_n$. Finally, I will discuss the
recent global solution for the correlators of all the ICFT's in the master
equation.
