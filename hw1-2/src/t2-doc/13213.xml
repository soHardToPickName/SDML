The Mandelstam--Leibbrandt Prescription and the Discretized Light Front
  Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the quantization of the unphysical degrees of freedom, which
leads to the Mandelstam--Leibbrandt prescription for the infrared spurious
singularities in the continuum light cone gauge, does indeed suggest some quite
natural recipe to treat the zero modes in the Discretized Light Front
Quantization of gauge theories.
