Immersions and folds in string theories of gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A two-dimensional string model with dynamical cancellation of folds is
considered. The action of the model contains the self-intersection number which
is defined for surfaces immersed into 4D targets. The two additional variables
are not dynamical and live on a compact manifold. In this sense the model is a
compactification of a 4D theory. The cancellation forces the string $\th$ angle
to be equal $\pi$. Candidates for string states are constructed. Some
mathematical background is given.
