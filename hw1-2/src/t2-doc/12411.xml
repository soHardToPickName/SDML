New Superembeddings for Type II Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  Possible ways of generalization of the superembedding approach for the
supersurfaces with the number of Grassmann directions being less than the half
of that for the target superspace are considered on example of Type II
superstrings. Focus is on n=(1,1) superworldsheet embedded into D=10 Type II
superspace that is of the interest for establishing a relation with the NSR
string.
