Liouville Field Theory on a Unoriented Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  Liouville field theory on a unoriented surface is investigated, in
particular, the one point function on a RP^2 is calculated. The constraint of
the one point function is obtained by using the crossing symmetry of the two
point function. There are many solutions of the constraint and we can choose
one of them by considering the modular bootstrap.
