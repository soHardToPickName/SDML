Point-Like States for Type 2b Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper considers closed-string states of type 2b superstring theory in
which the whole string is localized at a single point in superspace.
Correlation functions of these (scalar and pseudoscalar) states possess an
infinite number of position-space singularities inside and on the light-cone as
well as a space-like singularity outside the light-cone.\foot{This paper was
previously produced as preprint QMW-91-02.}
