Multi-Instanton Calculus in Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I review some recent results concerning multi-instanton calculus
in supersymmetric field theories. More in detail, I will show how these
computations can be efficiently performed using the formalism of topological
field theories.
