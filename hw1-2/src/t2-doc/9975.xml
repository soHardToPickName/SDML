Infinite-dimensional algebras in dimensionally reduced string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine 4-dimensional string backgrounds compactified over a two torus.
There exist two alternative effective Lagrangians containing each two
$SL(2)/U(1)$ sigma-models. Two of these sigma-models are the complex and the
K\"ahler structures on the torus. The effective Lagrangians are invariant under
two different $O(2,2)$ groups and by the successive applications of these
groups the affine $\widehat{O}(2,2)$ Kac-Moody is emerged. The latter has also
a non-zero central term which generates constant Weyl rescalings of the reduced
2-dimensional background. In addition, there exists a number of discrete
symmetries relating the field content of the reduced effective Lagrangians.
