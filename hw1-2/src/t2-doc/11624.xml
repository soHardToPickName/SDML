Noncommutative radial waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We study radial waves in (2+1)-dimensional noncommutative scalar field
theory, using operatorial methods. The waves propagate along a discrete radial
coordinate and are described by finite series deformations of Bessel-type
functions. At radius much larger than the noncommutativity scale
$\sqrt{\theta}$, one recovers the usual commutative behaviour. At small
distances, classical divergences are smoothed out by noncommutativity.
