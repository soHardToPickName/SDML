D-branes on T^4/Z_2 and T-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we discuss D-branes on T^4/Z_2 using the boundary states
formalism. Explicit formulas for the untwisted boundary states inherited from
the underlying T^4 and twisted states corresponding to branes wrapping
collapsed 2-cycles at the orbifold singularities are given. The exact CFT
description of the orbifold makes it possible to study how the boundary states
transform under R_i -> 1/R_i transformation on all directions of the underlying
T^4. We compare their transformation law with results obtained from world
volume considerations.
