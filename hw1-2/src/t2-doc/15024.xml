Higgs Driven Geodetic Evolution/Nucleation of de-Sitter Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  Geodetic evolution of a de-Sitter brane is exclusively driven by a Higgs
potential, rather than by a plain cosmological constant. The deviation from
Einstein gravity, parameterized by the conserved bulk energy, is characterized
by a hairy horizon which serves as the locus of unbroken symmetry. The quartic
structure of the potential, singled out on finiteness grounds of the total
(including the dark component) energy density, chooses the no-boundary
proposal.
