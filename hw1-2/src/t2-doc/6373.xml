Convergent sequences of perturbative approximations for the anharmonic
  oscillator II. Compact time approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an alternative pathway in the application of the variation
improvement of ordinary perturbation theory exposed in [1] which can preserve
the internal symmetries of a model by means of a time compactification.
