On Bosonic and Supersymmetric Current Algebras for Non-Semi-Simple
  Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a systematic approach to constructing current algebras based on
non-semi-simple groups. The Virasoro central charges corresponding to these
current algebras are not, in general, given by integer numbers. The key point
in this construction is that the bilinear form appearing in the current algebra
can be different from the bilinear form used to raise and lower group indices.
The action which realises this current algebra as its symmetry is also found.
