Test of dilute gas approximation in quantum mechanical model
</title>

<abstract>
  The validity of dilute gas approximation is explored by making use of the
large-sized instanton in quantum mechanical model. It is shown that the
Euclidean probability amplitude derived through a dilute gas approximation not
only cannot explain the result of the linear combination of atomic orbitals
approximation, but also does not exhibit a proper limiting case when the size
of instanton is very large.
