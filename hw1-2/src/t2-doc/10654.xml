An SL(2,Z) Multiplet of Type IIB Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  An SL(2, Z) family of string solutions of type IIB supergravity in ten
dimensions is constructed. The solutions are labeled by a pair of relatively
prime integers, which characterize charges of the three-form field strengths.
The string tensions depend on these charges in an SL(2, Z) covariant way.
Compactifying on a circle and identifying with eleven-dimensional supergravity
compactified on a torus implies that the modulus of the IIB theory should be
equated to the modular parameter of the torus.
