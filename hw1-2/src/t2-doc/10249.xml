A Non-perturbative Description of the Gimon-Polchinski Orientifold
</title>

<abstract>
  A T-dual version of the Gimon-Polchinski orientifold can be described by a
configuration of intersecting Dirichlet seven branes and orientifold seven
planes in the classical limit. We study modification of this background due to
quantum corrections. It is shown that non-perturbative effects split each
orientifold plane into a pair of nearly parallel seven branes. Furthermore, a
pair of intersecting orientifold planes, instead of giving rise to two pairs of
intersecting seven branes, gives just one pair of seven branes, each
representing a pair of nearly orthogonal seven branes smoothly joined to each
other near the would be intersection point. Interpretation of these results
from the point of view of the dynamics on a three brane probe is also
discussed.
