String theory: an update
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview of some of the developments in string theory over the past two
years is given, focusing on four topics: realistic (standard model like) models
from string theory, geometric engineering and theories with fluxes, the gauge
theory-gravity correspondence, and time dependent backgrounds and string
theory. Plenary talk at ICHEP'02, Amsterdam, July 24-31, 2002.
