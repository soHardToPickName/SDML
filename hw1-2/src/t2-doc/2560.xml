Periodic Monopoles With Singularities And N=2 Super-QCD

<abstract>
  We study solutions of the Bogomolny equation on R^2\times S^1$ with
prescribed singularities. We show that Nahm transform establishes a one-to-one
correspondence between such solutions and solutions of the Hitchin equations on
a punctured cylinder with the eigenvalues of the Higgs field growing at
infinity in a particular manner. The moduli spaces of solutions have natural
hyperkahler metrics of a novel kind. We show that these metrics describe the
quantum Coulomb branch of certain N=2 d=4 supersymmetric gauge theories on
R^3\times S^1. The Coulomb branches of the corresponding uncompactified
theories have been previously determined by E. Witten using the M-theory
fivebrane. We show that the Seiberg-Witten curves of these theories are
identical to the spectral curves associated to solutions of the Bogomolny
equation on R^2\times S^1. In particular, this allows us to rederive Witten's
results without recourse to the M-theory fivebrane.
