Wilsonian Approximated Renormalization Group for Matrix and Vector
  Models in 2<d<4

<abstract>
  Wilson's approximation scheme of RG recursion formula dropping momentum
dependence of the propagators is applied to large-$N$ vector and matrix models
in dimensions $2<d<4$ by making use of their exact solutions in zero dimension.
In spite of apparent dependence of critical exponents upon the dilatational
parameter $\rho$ involved by the approximation, the exact exponents are
reproduced for vector models in the limit $\rho\rightarrow 0$. Application to
matrix models is then reexamined after the same fashion. It predicts critical
exponents $\nu=2/d$ and $\eta=2-d/2$ for the $\tr \Phi^4$ matrix model.
