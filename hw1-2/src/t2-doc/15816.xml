Effective interactions of a light gravitino
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some recent results on the effective interactions of a light
gravitino with ordinary particles. In particular, we discuss on a simple
example a novel aspect of the low-energy theorems for broken supersymmetry: in
the effective lagrangian describing the goldstino couplings to matter, there
are terms bilinear in the goldstino that, already at the lowest non-trivial
order, are not entirely controlled by the supersymmetry-breaking scale, and
introduce additional free parameters. We conclude by mentioning some
phenomenological implications, including a lower bound on the gravitino mass
from collider data.
