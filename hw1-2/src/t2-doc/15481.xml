R-matrices and Tensor Product Graph Method
</title>

<abstract>
  A systematic method for constructing trigonometric R-matrices corresponding
to the (multiplicity-free) tensor product of any two affinizable
representations of a quantum algebra or superalgebra has been developed by the
Brisbane group and its collaborators. This method has been referred to as the
Tensor Product Graph Method. Here we describe applications of this method to
untwisted and twisted quantum affine superalgebras.
