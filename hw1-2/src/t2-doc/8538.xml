Quantum Field Theory on Noncommutative Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  A pedagogical and self-contained introduction to noncommutative quantum field
theory is presented, with emphasis on those properties that are intimately tied
to string theory and gravity. Topics covered include the Weyl-Wigner
correspondence, noncommutative Feynman diagrams, UV/IR mixing, noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory on infinite space and on the torus, Morita equivalences of
noncommutative gauge theories, twisted reduced models, and an in-depth study of
the gauge group of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. Some of the more
mathematical ideas and techniques of noncommutative geometry are also briefly
explained.
