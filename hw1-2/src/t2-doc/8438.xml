Stability and the negative mode for Schwarzschild in a finite cavity
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been proposed that translationally-invariant black branes are
classically stable if and only if they are locally thermodynamically stable.
Reall has outlined a general argument to demonstrate this, and studied in
detail the case of charged black p-branes in type II supergravity. We consider
the application of his argument in the simplest non-trivial case, an uncharged
asymptotically flat brane enclosed in a finite cylindrical cavity. In this
simple context, it is possible to give a more complete argument than in the
cases considered earlier, and it is therefore a particularly attractive example
of the general approach.
