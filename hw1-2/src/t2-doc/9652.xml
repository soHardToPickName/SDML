Microcanonical statistics of black holes and bootstrap condition
</title>

<abstract>
  The microcanonical statistics of the Schwarzschild black holes as well as the
Reissner-Nordstr$\sf \ddot{o}$m black holes are analyzed. In both cases we set
up the inequalities in the microcanonical density of states.
  These are then used to show that the most probable configuration in the gases
of black holes is that one black hole acquires all of the mass and all of the
charge at high energy limit. Thus the black holes obey the statistical
bootstrap condition and, in contrast to the other investigation, we see that
U(1) charge does not break the bootstrap property.
