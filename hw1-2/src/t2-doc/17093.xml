Twisted N=2 Supersymmetry with Central Charge and Equivariant Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an equivariant extension of the Thom form with respect to a vector
field action, in the framework of the Mathai-Quillen formalism. The associated
Topological Quantum Field Theories correspond to twisted $N=2$ supersymmetric
theories with a central charge. We analyze in detail two different cases:
topological sigma models and non-abelian monopoles on four-manifolds.
