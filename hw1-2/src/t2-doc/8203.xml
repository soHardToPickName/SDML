The ground state energy of a spinor field in the background of a finite
  radius flux tube

  We develop a formalism for the calculation of the ground state energy of a
spinor field in the background of a cylindrically symmetric magnetic field. The
energy is expressed in terms of the Jost function of the associated scattering
problem. Uniform asymptotic expansions needed are obtained from the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The general results derived are applied to the
background of a finite radius flux tube with a homogeneous magnetic field
inside and the ground state energy is calculated numerically as a function of
the radius and the flux. It turns out to be negative, remaining smaller by a
factor of $\alpha$ than the classical energy of the background except for very
small values of the radius which are outside the range of applicability of QED.
