On M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This contribution gives a personal view on recent attempts to find a unified
framework for non-perturbative string theories, with special emphasis on the
hidden symmetries of supergravity and their possible role in this endeavor. A
reformulation of $d=11$ supergravity with enlarged tangent space symmetry
SO(1,2) $\times$ SO(16) is discussed from this perspective, as well as an
ansatz to construct yet further versions with SO(1,1) $\times$ SO(16)$^\infty$
and possibly even SO(1,1)$_+$ $\times$ ISO(16)$^\infty$ tangent space symmetry.
It is suggested that upon ``third quantization'', dimensionally reduced maximal
supergravity may have an equally important role to play in this unification as
the dimensionally reduced maximally supersymmetric $SU(\infty)$ Yang Mills
theory.
