6 + 1 Vacua in Supersymmetric QCD with G_2 Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=1 supersymmetric QCD based on the G_2 gauge group and including
3 chiral matter 7-plets. In that case, the gauge symmetry is broken completely
and the instanton-generated superpotential on the classical moduli space is
present. If the theory involves the Yukawa term, there are six chirally
asymmetric vacua. In the limit when the Yukawa coupling vanishes, two of the
vacua run away to infinity and only 4 asymmetric vacuum states are left.
Besides, a chirally symmetric state is always present. We consider also an O(7)
model with 4 chiral multiplets in spinor representation. In that case, there
are 4 extra "virtual vacua" dwelling at infinity of the moduli space. In a
non-renormalizable theory involving a quartic term in the superpotential, they
show up at finite moduli values.
