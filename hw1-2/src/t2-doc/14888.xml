The BRS invariance of noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory at the
  one-loop level
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that U(N) Yang-Mills theory on noncommutative Minkowski space-time
can be renormalized, in a BRS invariant way, at the one-loop level, by
multiplicative dimensional renormalization of its coupling constant, its gauge
parameter and its fields. It is shown that the Slavnov-Taylor equation, the
gauge-fixing equation and the ghost equation hold, up to order $\hbar$, for the
MS renormalized noncommutative U(N) Yang-Mills theory. We give the value of the
pole part of every 1PI diagram which is UV divergent.
