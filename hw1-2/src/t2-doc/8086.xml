A note on the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 Super Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the Seiberg-Witten treatment of N=2 super Yang-Mills theory, and
note that in the strong coupling region of moduli space, some massive particle
excitations appear to have negative norm. We discuss the significance of our
observation.
