BPS preons and tensionless super-p-brane in generalized superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  Tensionless super-p-branes in a generalized superspace with additional
tensorial central charge coordinates may provide an extended object model for
BPS preons, i.e. for the hypothetical constituents of M-theory preserving 31 of
32 supersymmetries [hep-th/0101113].
