A new holographic entropy bound from quantum geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  A new entropy bound, tighter than the standard holographic bound due to
Bekenstein, is derived for spacetimes with non-rotating isolated horizons, from
the quantum geometry approach in which the horizon is described by the boundary
degrees of freedom of a three dimensional Chern Simons theory.
