Burgers' equation in non-commutative space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  The Moyal *-deformed noncommutative version of Burgers' equation is
considered. Using the *-analog of the Cole-Hopf transformation, the
linearization of the model in terms of the linear heat equation is found.
Noncommutative q-deformations of shock soliton solutions and their interaction
are described
