On domain shapes and processes in supersymmetric theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A supersymmetric theory with several scalar superfields generically has
several domain wall type classical configurations which interpolate between
various supersymmetric vacua of the scalar fields. Depending on the couplings,
some of these configurations develop instability and decay into multiple domain
walls, others can form intersections in space. These phenomena are considered
here in a simplest, yet non-trivial, model with two scalar superfields.
