The non-abelian D-brane effective action through order $\alpha'{}^4$
</title>

<abstract>
  Requiring the existence of certain BPS solutions to the equations of motion,
we determine the bosonic part of the non-abelian D-brane effective action
through order $\alpha'{}^4$. We also propose an economic organizational
principle for the effective action.
