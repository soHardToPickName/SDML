Two-Loop Superstrings in Hyperelliptic Language III: the Four-Particle
  Amplitude
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute explicitly the four-particle amplitude in superstring theories by
using the hyperelliptic language and the newly obtained chiral measure of
D'Hoker and Phong. Although the algebra of the intermediate steps is a little
bit involved, we obtain a quite simple expression for the four-particle
amplitude. As expected, the integrand is independent of all the insertion
points. As an application of the obtained result, we show that the perturbative
correction to the $R^4$ term in type II superstring theories is vanishing
point-wise in (even) moduli space at two loops.
