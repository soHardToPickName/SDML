Finite Deformations of Conformal Field Theories Using Analytically
  Regularized Connections
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some natural connections on spaces of conformal field theories using
an analytical regularization method. The connections are based on marginal
conformal field theory deformations. We show that the analytical regularization
preserves conformal invariance and leads to integrability of the marginal
deformations. The connections are shown to be flat and to generate well-defined
finite parallel transport. These finite parallel transports yield formulations
of the deformed theories in the state space of an undeformed theory. The
restrictions of the connections to the tangent space are curved but free of
torsion.
