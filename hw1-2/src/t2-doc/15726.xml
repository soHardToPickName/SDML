Monopole Condensation and Dimensional Transmutation in SU(2) QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We resolve the controversy on the stability of the monopole condensation in
the one-loop effective action of SU(2) QCD by calculating the imaginary part of
the effective action with two different methods at one-loop order. Our result
confirms that the effective action for the magnetic background has no imaginary
part but the one for the electric background has a negative imaginary part.
This assures that the monopole condensation is indeed stable, but the electric
background becomes unstable due to the pair-annihilation of gluons.
