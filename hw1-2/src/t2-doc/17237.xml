Fluxbranes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A flux p-brane in D dimensions has (p+1)-dimensional Poincare invariance and
a nonzero rank (D-p-1) field strength tangent to the transverse dimensions. We
find a family of such solutions in string theory and M-theory and investigate
their properties.
