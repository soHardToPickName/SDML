Does Magnetic Charge Imply a Massive Photon ?
</title>

<abstract>
  In Abelian theories of monopoles the magnetic charge is required to be
enormous. Using the electric-magnetic duality of electromagnetism it is argued
that the existence of such a large, non-perturbative magnetic coupling should
lead to a phase transition where magnetic charge is permanently confined and
the photon becomes massive. The apparent masslessness of the photon could then
be used as an argument against the existence of such a large, non-perturbative
magnetic charge. Finally it is shown that even in the presence of this
dynamical mass generation the Cabbibo-Ferrari formulation of magnetic charge
gives a consistent theory.
