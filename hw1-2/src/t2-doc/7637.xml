Quantum N=2 super $W_3^{(2)}$ Algebra In Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the N=2 extension of Polyakov-Bershadsky $W_3^{(2)}$ algebra with
the generic central charge, $c$, at the quantum level in superspace. It
contains, in addition to the spin 1 N=2 stress tensor, the spins $1/2, 2$
bosonic and spins $1/2, 2$ fermionic supercurrents satisfying the first class
nonlinear chiral constraints. In the $c \to \infty $ limit, the ``classical''
N=2 $W_3^{(2)}$ algebra is recovered.
