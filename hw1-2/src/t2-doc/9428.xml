One-Loop Pauli-Villars Regularization of Supergravity I: Canonical Gauge
  Kinetic Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the one-loop coefficients of on-shell operators of standard
supergravity with canonical gauge kinetic energy can be regulated by the
introduction of Pauli-Villars chiral and abelian gauge multiplets, subject to a
condition on the matter representations of the gauge group. Aspects of the
anomaly structure of these theories under global nonlinear symmetries and an
anomalous gauge symmetry are discussed.
