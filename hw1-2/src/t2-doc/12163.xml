Non-Equilibrium Time Evolution in Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The time development of equal-time correlation functions in quantum mechanics
and quantum field theory is described by an exact evolution equation for
generating functionals. This permits a comparison between classical and quantum
evolution in non-equilibrium systems.
