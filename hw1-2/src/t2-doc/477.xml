The operator algebra of the discrete state operators in 2D gravity with
  non-vanishing cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Remarks are given to the structure of physical states in 2D gravity coupled
to $C\leq 1$ matter. The operator algebra of the discrete state operators is
calculated for the theory with non-vanishing cosmological constant.
