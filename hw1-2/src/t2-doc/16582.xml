Hirota equation as an example of integrable symplectic map
</title>

<abstract>
  The hamiltonian formalism is developed for the sine-Gordon model on the
space-time light-like lattice, first introduced by Hirota. The evolution
operator is explicitely constructed in the quantum variant of the model, the
integrability of the corresponding classical finite-dimensional system is
established.
