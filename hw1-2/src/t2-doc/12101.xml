On the One Loop Fayet-Iliopoulos Term in Chiral Four Dimensional Type I
  Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the generation of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms at one string loop in
some recently found N=1 open string orbifolds with anomalous U(1) factors with
nonvanishing trace of the charge. Low-energy field theory arguments lead one to
expect a one loop quadratically divergent Fayet-Iliopoulos term. We show that a
one loop Fayet-Iliopoulos term is not generated, due to a cancellation between
contributions of worldsheets of different topology. The vanishing of the one
loop Fayet-Iliopoulos term in open string compactifications is related to the
cancellation of twisted Ramond-Ramond tadpoles.
