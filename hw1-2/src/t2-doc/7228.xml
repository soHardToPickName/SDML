Twistors and Actions on Coset Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Particle and string actions on coset spaces typically lack a quadratic
kinetic term, making their quantization difficult. We define a notion of
twistors on these spaces, which are hypersurfaces in a vector space that
transform linearly under the isometry group of the coset. By associating the
points of the coset space with these hypersurfaces, and the internal
coordinates of these hypersurfaces with momenta, it is possible to construct
manifestly symmetric actions with leading quadratic terms. We give a general
algorithm and work out the case of a particle on AdS_p explicitly. In this
case, the resulting action is a world-line gauge theory with sources, (the
gauge group depending on p) which is equivalent to a nonlocal world-line
sigma-model.
