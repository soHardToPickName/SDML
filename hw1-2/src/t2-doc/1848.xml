Large Volume Perspective on Branes at Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider a somewhat unconventional approach for deriving
worldvolume theories for D3 branes probing Calabi-Yau singularities. The
strategy consists of extrapolating the calculation of F-terms to the large
volume limit. This method circumvents the inherent limitations of more
traditional approaches used for orbifold and toric singularities. We illustrate
its usefulness by deriving quiver theories for D3 branes probing singularities
where a Del Pezzo surface containing four, five or six exceptional curves
collapses to zero size. In the latter two cases the superpotential depends
explicitly on complex structure parameters. These are examples of probe
theories for singularities which can currently not be computed by other means.
