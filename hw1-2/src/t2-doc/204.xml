The Outer-Automorphic WZW Orbifolds on so(2n), including Five Triality
  Orbifolds on so(8)
</title>

<abstract>
  Following recent advances in the local theory of current-algebraic orbifolds
we present the basic dynamics - including the {\it twisted KZ equations} - of
each twisted sector of all outer-automorphic WZW orbifolds on so(2n). Physics-
friendly Cartesian bases are used throughout, and we are able in particular to
assemble two $Z_3$ triality orbifolds and three $S_3$ triality orbifolds on
so(8).
