Conserved Quantities in Kerr-anti-de Sitter Spacetimes in Various
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the conserved charges for Kerr anti-de Sitter spacetimes in
various dimensions using the conformal and the counterterm prescriptions. We
show that the conserved charge corresponding to the global timelike killing
vector computed by the two methods differ by a constant dependent on the
rotation parameter and cosmological constant in odd spacetime dimensions,
whereas the charge corresponding to the rotational killing vector is the same
in either approach. We comment on possible implications of our results to the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
