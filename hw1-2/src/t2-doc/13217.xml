Fuzzy Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a series of instanton-like solutions to a matrix model which
satisfy a self-duality condition and possess an action whose value is, to
within a fixed constant factor, an integer l^2. For small values of the
dimension n^2 of the matrix algebra the integer resembles the result of a
quantization condition but as n -> \infty the ratio l/n can tend to an
arbitrary real number between zero and one.
