Exercises in equivariant cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  Equivariant cohomology is a mathematical framework particularly well adapted
to a kinematical understanding of topological gauge theories of the
cohomological type. It also sheds some light on gauge fixing, a necessary field
theory operation connected with the non compactness of the gauge group. The
respective roles of fields and observables are emphasized throughout.
