Fermion Condensates of massless $QED_2$ at Finite Density in non-trivial
  Topological Sectors
</title>

<abstract>
  Vacuum expectation values of products of local bilinears $\bar\psi\psi$ are
computed in massless $QED_2$ at finite density. It is shown that chiral
condensates exhibit an oscillatory inhomogeneous behaviour depending on the
chemical potential. The use of a path-integral approach clarifies the
connection of this phenomenon with the topological structure of the theory.
