Effective Actions Near Singularities: The STU-Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the low energy effective action of the STU-model in four and five
dimensions near the line T=U, where SU(2) gauge symmetry enhancement occurs. By
`integrating in' the light W^{\pm} bosons together with their superpartners,
the quantum corrected effective action becomes non-singular at T=U and
manifestly SU(2) invariant. The four-dimensional theory is found to be
consistent with modular invariance and the five-dimensional decompactification
limit. This talk concisely summarizes results that have been obtained in
collaboration with J. Louis and T. Mohaupt.
