Multi-Domain Walls in Massive Supersymmetric Sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Massive maximally-supersymmetric sigma models are shown to exhibit multiple
static kink-domain wall solutions that preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry. The
kink moduli space admits a natural Kahler metric. We examine in some detail the
case when the target of the sigma model is given by the co-tangent bundle of
CP^n equipped with the Calabi metric, and we show that there exist BPS
solutions corresponding to n kinks at arbitrary separation. We also describe
how 1/4-BPS charged and intersecting domain walls are described in the
low-energy dynamics on the kink moduli space. We comment on the similarity of
these results to monopole dynamics.
