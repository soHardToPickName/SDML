Quadratic action for type IIB supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  The quadratic action for physical fields of type IIB supergravity model on
$AdS_5\times S^5$ is derived starting from the recently found covariant action.
All boundary terms that have to be added to the action to be used in the
AdS/CFT correspondence are determined.
