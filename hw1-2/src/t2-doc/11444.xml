Exact solutions to quantum field theories and integrable equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The exact solutions to quantum string and gauge field theories are discussed
and their formulation in the framework of integrable systems is presented. In
particular I consider in detail several examples of appearence of solutions to
the first-order integrable equations of hydrodynamical type and stress that all
known examples can be treated as partial solutions to the same problem in the
theory of integrable systems.
