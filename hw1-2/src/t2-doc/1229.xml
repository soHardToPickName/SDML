Anti-DeSitter Spaces and Nonextreme Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  At low energy the near horizon geometry of nonextreme black holes in four
dimensions exhibits an effective SL(2,R)_L x SL(2,R)_R symmetry. The parameters
of the corresponding induced conformal field theory gives the correct
expression for the black hole entropy. The resulting spectrum of the
Schwarzchild black hole is compared with another proposal.
