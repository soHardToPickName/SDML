Duality and $O(d,d)$ Symmetries in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The evolution of a closed bosonic string is envisaged in the time-dependent
background of its massless modes. A duality transformation is implemented on
the spatial component of string coordinates to obtain a dual string. It is
shown that the evolution equations are manifestly $O(d,d)$ invariant. The tree
level string effective actions for the original and the dual string theory are
shown to be equivalent.
