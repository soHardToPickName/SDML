Magnetic Confinement in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a strong evidence for the magnetic confinement in QCD by
demonstrating that the one loop effective action of SU(2) QCD induces a
dynamical symmetry breaking thorugh the monopole condensation, which could
induce the dual Meissner effect and guarantee the confinement of color in the
non-Abelian gauge theory. The result is obtained by separating the topological
degrees which describes the non-Abelian monopoles from the dynamical degrees of
the potential, and integrating out all the dynamical degrees of QCD.
