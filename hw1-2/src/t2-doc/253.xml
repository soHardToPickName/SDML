Scalar Curvature Factor in the Schroedinger Equation and Scattering on a
  Curved Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  The scattering of free particles constrained to move on a cylindrically
symmetric curved surface is studied. The nontrivial geometry of the space
contributes to the scattering cross section through the kinetic as well as a
possible scalar curvature term in the quantum Hamiltonian. The coefficient of
the latter term is known to be related to the factor ordering problem in curved
space quantization. Hence, in principle, the scattering data may be used to
provide an experimental resolution of the theoretical factor ordering
ambiguity. To demonstrate the sensitivity required of such an experimental
setup, the effect of a localized magnetic field in the scattering process is
also analyzed.
