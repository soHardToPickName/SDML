N=2 Current Algebras for Non-Semi-Simple Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the problem of constructing N=2 superconformal algebras out of N=1
non-semi-simple affine Lie algebras. These N=2 superconformal theories share
the property that the super Virasoro central charge depends only on the
dimension of the Lie algebra. We find, in particular, a construction having a
central charge c=9. This provides a possible internal space for string
compactification and where mirror symmetry might be explored.
