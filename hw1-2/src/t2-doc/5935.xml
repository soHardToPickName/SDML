Division Algebras, Extended Supersymmetries and Applications
</title>

<abstract>
  I present here some new results which make explicit the role of the division
algebras R,C,H,O in the construction and classification of, respectively,
N=1,2,4,8 global supersymmetric quantum mechanical and classical dynamical
systems. In particular an N=8 Malcev superaffine algebra is introduced and its
relation to the non-associative N=8 SCA is discussed. A list of present and
possible future applications is given.
