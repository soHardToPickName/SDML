Planar Two-particle Coulomb Interaction: Classical and Quantum Aspects
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical and quantum aspects of planar Coulomb interactions have been
studied in detail. In the classical scenario, Action Angle Variables are
introduced to handle relativistic corrections, in the scheme of
time-independent perturbation theory. Complications arising due to the
logarithmic nature of the potential are pointed out. In the quantum case,
harmonic oscillator approximations are considered and effects of the
perturbations on the excited (oscillator) states have been analysed. In both
the above cases, the known 3+1-dimensional analysis is carried through side by
side, for a comparison with the 2+1-dimensional (planar) results.
