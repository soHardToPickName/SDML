Noncommutative field theory description of quantum Hall skyrmions
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit the quantum Hall system with no Zeeman splitting energy using the
noncommutative field theory. We analyze the BPS condition for the
delta-function interaction near the filling factor $\nu=1$. Multi-skyrmions are
shown to saturate the BPS bounds. The dimension of the moduli space of $k$
skyrmions is $4k+2$. Advantage of the noncommutative field description is
demonstrated through the derivation of the effective nonlinear $\sigma$ model
Lagrangian.
