Off-shell structure of the string sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  The off-shell structure of the string sigma model is investigated. In the
open bosonic string, nonperturbative effects are shown to depend crucially on
the regularization scheme. A scheme retaining the notion of string width
reproduces the structure of Witten's string field theory and the associated
unconventional gauge transformations.
