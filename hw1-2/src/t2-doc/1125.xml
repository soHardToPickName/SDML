Cosmological Background torsion limits from Lorentz violation
</title>

<abstract>
  Cosmological limits on Lorentz invariance breaking in Chern-Simons
$(3+1)-dimensional$ electrodynamics are used to place limits on torsion.
Birefrigence phenomena is discussed by using extending the propagation equation
to Riemann-Cartan spacetimes instead of treating it in purely Riemannian
spaces. The parameter of Lorentz violation is shown to be proportional to the
axial torsion vector which allows us to place a limit on cosmological
background torsion from the Lorentz violation constraint which is given by $
10^{-33} eV <|S^{\mu}| < 10^{-32} eV$ where $|S^{\mu}|$ is the axial torsion
vector.
