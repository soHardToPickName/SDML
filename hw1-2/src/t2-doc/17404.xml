Perturbative diagrams in string field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A general algorithm is presented which gives a closed-form expression for an
arbitrary perturbative diagram of cubic string field theory at any loop order.
For any diagram, the resulting expression is given by an integral of a function
of several infinite matrices, each built from a finite number of blocks
containing the Neumann coefficients of Witten's 3-string vertex. The
closed-form expression for any diagram can be approximated by level truncation
on oscillator level, giving a computation involving finite size matrices. Some
simple tree and loop diagrams are worked out as examples of this approach.
