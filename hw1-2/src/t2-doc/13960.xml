Black Hole Radiance and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with free massless scalar and spinor fields described by a globally
N=1 supersymmetric action, infalling on a Schwarzschild black hole, the
outgoing Hawking radiation is shown to break supersymmetry spontaneously,
exactly as induced by a heat bath in Minkowski space, with no generation of
Nambu-Goldstone fermions.
