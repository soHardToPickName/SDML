Electron-positron pair production in the Aharonov-Bohm potential
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of QED we evaluate the cross section for electron-positron
pair production by a single photon in the presence of the external
Aharonov-Bohm potential in first order of perturbation theory. We analyse
energy, angular and polarization distributions at different energy regimes:
near the threshold and at high photon energies.
