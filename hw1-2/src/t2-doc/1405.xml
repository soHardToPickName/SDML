Power counting degree versus singular order in the Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  The importance of a rigorous definition of the singular degree of a
distribution is demonstrated on the case of two-dimensional QED (Schwinger
model). Correct mathematical treatment of second order vacuum polarization in
the perturbative approach is crucial in order to obtain the Schwinger mass of
the photon by resummation.
