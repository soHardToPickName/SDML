Casimir Effects in Renormalizable Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the framework we and our collaborators have developed for the study
of one-loop quantum corrections to extended field configurations in
renormalizable quantum field theories. We work in the continuum, transforming
the standard Casimir sum over modes into a sum over bound states and an
integral over scattering states weighted by the density of states. We express
the density of states in terms of phase shifts, allowing us to extract
divergences by identifying Born approximations to the phase shifts with low
order Feynman diagrams. Once isolated in Feynman diagrams, the divergences are
canceled against standard counterterms. Thus regulated, the Casimir sum is
highly convergent and amenable to numerical computation. Our methods have
numerous applications to the theory of solitons, membranes, and quantum field
theories in strong external fields or subject to boundary conditions.
