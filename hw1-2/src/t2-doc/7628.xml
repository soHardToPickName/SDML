On non-abelian generalisation of Born-Infeld action in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the part of the tree-level open string effective action for the
non-abelian vector field which depends on the field strength but not on its
covariant derivatives, is given by the symmetrised trace of the direct
non-abelian generalisation of the Born-Infeld invariant. We discuss
applications to D-brane dynamics.
