Temperature correlators in the one-dimensional Hubbard model in the
  strong coupling limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the one-dimensional Hubbard model with the infinitely strong
repulsion. The two-point dynamical temperature correlation functions are
calculated. They are represented as Fredholm determinants of linear integrable
integral operators.
