Ground State in Gluodynamics and Quark Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of the ground state wavefunctional in gluodynamics responsible
for confinement are considered. It is shown that confinement arises due to the
generation of a mass gap in the averaging over the gauge group which is
necessary to ensure the gauge invariance of the ground state. The string
tension is calculated in assumption of a particular infrared behavior of the
vacuum wavefunctional.
