Anyonic Realization of $SU_q(N)$ Quantum Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering a set of $N$ anyonic oscillators ( non-local, intrinsic
two-dimensional objects interpolating between fermionic and bosonic
oscillators) on a two-dimensional lattice, we realize the $SU_q(N)$ quantum
algebra by means of a generalized Schwinger construction. We find that the
deformation parameter $q$ of the algebra is related to the anyonic statistical
parameter $\nu$ by $q=exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$.
