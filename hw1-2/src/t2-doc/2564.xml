Poincar\'e Supersymmetry Representations Over Trace Class Noncommutative
  Graded Operator Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that rigid supersymmetry theories in four dimensions can be extended
to give supersymmetric trace (or generalized quantum) dynamics theories, in
which the supersymmetry algebra is represented by the generalized Poisson
bracket of trace supercharges, constructed from fields that form a trace class
noncommutative graded operator algebra. In particular, supersymmetry theories
can be turned into supersymmetric matrix models this way. We demonstrate our
results by detailed component field calculations for the Wess-Zumino and the
supersymmetric Yang-Mills models (the latter with axial gauge fixing), and then
show that they are also implied by a simple and general superspace argument.
