Propagators on the two-dimensional light-cone
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-cone quantization procedure recently presented is applied to the
two-dimensional light-cone theories. By introducing the two distinct null
planes it is shown that the modification term in the two-dimensional massless
light-cone propagators suggested about twenty years ago vanishs.
