Topological interpretation of Dirac equation and geometrization of
  physical interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Earlier we have shown that interacting electron-positron and electromagnetic
fields can be considered as a certain microscopic distortion of
pseudo-Euclidean properties of the Minkovsky 4-space-time. The known Dirac and
Maxwell equations prove to be group-theoretical relations describing this
distortion (nonmetrized closed 4-manifold). Here we apply the above geometrical
approach to obtain equations for a neutrino interacting with its weak field.
These equations contain some new terms and demonstrate geometrical mechanisms
of gauge-invariance and P-T violation. Equations are also proposed for
gravitational field and its microscopic quantum sources.
