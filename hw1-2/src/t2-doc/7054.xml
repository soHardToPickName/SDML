Membrane, Four-Brane and Dual Coordinates in the M(atrix) Theory
  Compactified on Tori
</title>

<abstract>
  In the M(atrix) theory by making the expansions of the matrices around the
membrane and four-brane solutions we derive the three- and five-dimensional
gauge theories on the dual tori. The explicit forms of solutions yield the dual
coordinates and each expansion is related to a toroidal compactification of the
M(atrix) theory. From the derived Lorentz and gauge invariant actions the gauge
coupling constants are shown to be characterized by the volume of the dual
tori.
