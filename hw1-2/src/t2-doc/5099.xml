Superfield approach to a novel symmetry for non-Abelian gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of superfield formalism, we demonstrate the existence of a
new local, covariant, continuous and nilpotent (dual-BRST) symmetry for the
BRST invariant Lagrangian density of a self-interacting two ($1 +
1$)-dimensional (2D) non-Abelian gauge theory (having no interaction with
matter fields). The local and nilpotent Noether conserved charges corresponding
to the above continuous symmetries find their geometrical interpretation as the
translation generators along the odd (Grassmannian) directions of the four ($2
+ 2)$-dimensional compact supermanifold.
