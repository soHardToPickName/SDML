A Note on Higher Dimensional Instantons and Supersymmetric Cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss instantons in dimensions higher than four. A generalized self-dual
or anti-self-dual instanton equation in n-dimensions can be defined in terms of
a closed (n-4) form $\Omega$ and it was recently employed as a topological
gauge fixing condition in higher dimensional generalizations of cohomological
Yang-Mills theory. When $\Omega$ is a calibration which is naturally introduced
on the manifold of special holomony, we argue that higher dimensional instanton
may be locally characterized as a family of four dimensional instantons over a
supersymmetric (n-4) cycle $\Sigma$ with respect to the calibration $\Omega$.
This is an instanton configuration on the total space of the normal bundle
$N(\Sigma)$ of the submanifold $\Sigma$ and regarded as a natural
generalization of point-like instanton in four dimensions that plays a
distinguished role in a compactification of instanton moduli space.
