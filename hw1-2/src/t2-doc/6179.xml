Thermal Instabilities and the "g"-Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify the recent proposal that the vacuum degeneracy "g" of a noncompact
worldsheet sigma model with a continuous spectrum of scaling dimensions is
lowered under renormalization group flow while preserving the central charge.
As an illustration we show that a relevant flow of the worldsheet RG induced by
a thermal perturbation of the unstable thermal vacuum of the type II string is
the noncompact supersymmetric vacuum with lower "g". Our analysis provides
nonperturbative confirmation of a conjecture due to Adams, Polchinski, and
Silverstein (APS) and its extension in the work of Harvey, Kutasov, Martinec,
and Moore (HKMM).
