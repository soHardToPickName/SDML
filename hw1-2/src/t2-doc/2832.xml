Area-preserving diffeomorphisms, W_{\infty} and $U_{q}(sl(2)) in
  Chern-Simons theory and Quantum Hall system
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a quantum \qa symmetry in Landau problem, which naturally arises
due to the relation between the \qa and the group of magnetic translations. The
last one is connected with the \w and area-preserving (symplectic)
diffeomorphisms which are the canonical transformations in the two-dimenssional
phase space. We shall discuss the hidden quantum symmetry in a $2+1$ gauge
theory with the Chern-Simons term and in aQuantum Hall system which are both
connected with the Landau problem.
