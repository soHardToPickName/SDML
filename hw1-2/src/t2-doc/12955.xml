Some Concepts of Modern Algebraic Geometry: Point, Ideal and
  Homomorphism
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from classical algebraic geometry over the complex numbers (as it
can be found for example in Griffiths and Harris it was the goal of these
lectures to introduce some concepts of the modern point of view in algebraic
geometry. Of course, it was quite impossible even to give an introduction to
the whole subject in such a limited time. For this reason the lectures and now
the write-up concentrate on the substitution of the concept of classical points
by the notion of ideals and homomorphisms of algebras.
