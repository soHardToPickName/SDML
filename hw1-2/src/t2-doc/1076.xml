Mapping between the Sinh-Gordon and Ising Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The $S$-matrix of the Ising Model can be obtained as particular limit of the
roaming trajectories associated to of the $S$-matrix of the Sinh-Gordon model.
Using the form factors of the Sinh-Gordon, we analyse the correspondence
between the operators of the two theories.
