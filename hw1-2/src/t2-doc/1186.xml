Algebraic Structures Related to Reflection Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Quadratic algebras related to the reflection equations are introduced. They
are quantum group comodule algebras. The quantum group $F_q(GL(2))$ is taken as
the example. The properties of the algebras (center, representations,
realizations, real forms, fusion procedure etc) as well as the generalizations
are discussed.
