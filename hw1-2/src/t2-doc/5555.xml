Randall-Sundrum Scenario at Nonzero Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The effect of temperature is investigated in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world
scenario. It is shown that for a spacetime ansatz motivated by similarity with
AdS/CFT correspondence several features of the model, such as its $Z_2$
symmetry, are not maintained at nonzero temperatures.
