Physical fields and Clifford algebras II. Neutrino field
</title>

<abstract>
  The neutrino field is considered in the framework of a complex Clifford
algebra $\C_3\cong\C_2\oplus\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$. The factor-algebras
${}^{\epsilon}\C_2$ and ${}^{\epsilon}\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, which are
obtained by means of homomorphic mappings $\C_3\to\C_2$ and
$\C_3\to\stackrel{\ast}{\C}_2$, are identified with the neutrino and
antineutrino fields, respectively. In this framework we have natural
explanation for absence of right-handed neutrino and left-handed antineutrino.
