Seiberg-Witten maps and noncommutative Yang-Mills theories for arbitrary
  gauge groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Seiberg-Witten maps and a recently proposed construction of noncommutative
Yang-Mills theories (with matter fields) for arbitrary gauge groups are
reformulated so that their existence to all orders is manifest. The ambiguities
of the construction which originate from the freedom in the Seiberg-Witten map
are discussed with regard to the question whether they can lead to inequivalent
models, i.e., models not related by field redefinitions.
