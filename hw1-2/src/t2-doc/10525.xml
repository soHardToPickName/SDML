Ground State Structure of a Coupled 2-Fermion System in Supersymmetric
  Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the uniqueness of the ground state for a supersymmetric quantum
mechanical system of two fermions and two bosons, which is closely related to
the N=1 WZ-model. The proof is constructive and gives detailed information on
what the ground state looks like.
