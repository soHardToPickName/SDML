Hamilton's Formalism for Systems with Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The main goal of these lectures is to introduce and review the Hamiltonian
formalism for classical constrained systems and in particular gauge theories.
Emphasis is put on the relation between local symmetries and constraints and on
the relation between Lagrangean and Hamiltonian symmetries.
