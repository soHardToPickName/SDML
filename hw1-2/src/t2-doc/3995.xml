AdS_5 and the 4D Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  The hypothesis is discussed that our universe is really 5--dimensional with a
nonzero cosmological constant that produces a large negative curvature. In this
scenario, the observable flat 4--dimensional universe is identified with the
holographic projection of the 5--dimensional world onto its own boundary.
