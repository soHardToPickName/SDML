High energy scattering amplitudes in matrix string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  High energy fixed angle scattering is studied in matrix string theory. The
saddle point world sheet configurations, which give the dominant contributions
to the string theory amplitude, are taken as classical backgrounds in matrix
string theory. A one loop fluctuation analysis about the classical background
is performed. An exact treatment of the fermionic and bosonic zero modes is
shown to lead to all of the expected structure of the scattering amplitude. The
ten dimensional Lorentz invariant kinematical structure is obtained from the
fermion zero modes, and the correct factor of the string coupling constant is
obtained from the abelian gauge field zero modes. Up to a numerical factor we
reproduce, from matrix string theory, the high energy limit of the tree level,
four graviton scattering amplitude.
