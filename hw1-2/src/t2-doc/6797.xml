(Supersymmetric) Kac-Moody Gauge Fields in 3+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Lagrangians for gauge fields and matter fields can be constructed from the
infinite dimensional Kac-Moody algebra and group. A continuum regularization is
used to obtain such generic lagrangians, which contain new nonlinear and
asymmetric interactions not present in gauge theories based on compact Lie
groups. This technique is applied to deriving the Yang-Mills and Chern-Simons
lagrangians for the Kac-Moody case. The extension of this method to D=4,
N=(1/2,0) supersymmetric Kac-Moody gauge fields is also made.
