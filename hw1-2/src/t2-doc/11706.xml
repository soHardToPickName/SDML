Large N Limit on Langevin Equation: Two-Dimensional Nonlinear Sigma
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the stochastic quantization of two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model
in the large $N$ limit. Our main tool is the {\it effective} Langevin equation
with which we investigate nonperturbative phenomena and derive the results
which are same as the path integral approach gives.
