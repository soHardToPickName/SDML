Light cone formalism in AdS spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Light cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime is described.
We also present light cone reformulation of the boundary conformal field theory
representations. AdS/CFT correspondence between the bulk fields and the
boundary operators is discussed.
