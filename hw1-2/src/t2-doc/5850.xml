Induced Topology on the Hoop Group
</title>

<abstract>
  A new topology is proposed on the space of holonomy equivalence classes of
loops, induced by the topology of the space $\Sigma$ in which the loops are
embedded. The possible role for the new topology in the context of the work by
Ashtekar et al. is discussed.
