Quantization of the Gravitational Constant in Odd-Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  It is pointed out that the action recently proposed by Ba\~nados et al. for
gravitation in odd dimensions higher (and lower) than four, provides a natural
quantization for the gravitational constant. These theories possess no
dimensionful parameters and hence they may be power counting renormalizable.
