The metron model. Towards a unified deterministic theory of fields and
  particles
</title>

<abstract>
  A conceptual summary is given of a deterministic unified field and particle
theory (the metron model) developed in more mathematical detail in a four-part
paper published in Physics Essays (1996/97). The model is developed from
Einsteins vacuum gravitational equations, Ricci tensor $R_{LM}=0$, in a higher
dimensional space. It is postulated that the equations support soliton-type
solutions (metrons) which reproduce all the basic field equations of quantum
field theory, including not only the Maxwell-Dirac-Einstein system, but also
all fields and symmetries of the Standard Model. Bell's theorem on the
non-existence of hidden-variable models of quantum phenomena is circumvented
through the time-reversal symmetry of all interactions on microphysical scales.
The model, when completed, should yield all particle properties and universal
physical constants from first principles.
