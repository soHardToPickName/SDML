Supersymmetries and BPS Configurations on Anti-de Sitter Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetry breaking due to the presence of branes on anti-de
Sitter space and obtain conditions for brane orientations not to break too many
supersymmetries. Using the conditions, we construct a brane configuration
corresponding to a baryon in large N gauge theory, and it is shown that the
baryon is a marginal bound state of quarks as is expected from supersymmetry.
