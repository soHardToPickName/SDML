Relating Friedmann equation to Cardy formula in universes with
  cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  A relation between the Friedmann equation and the Cardy formula has been
found for de Sitter closed and Anti de Sitter flat universes. For the remaining
(Anti) de Sitter universes the arguments fail, and we speculate whether the
general philosophy of holography can be satisfied in such contents.
