Fractional spin through quantum affine algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we study the fractional decomposition of the quantum
enveloping affine algebras $U_Q(\hat A(n))$ and $U_Q(\hat{C}(n))$ in the $Q\to
q=e\frac{2i\pi}k$ limit. This decomposition is based on the bosonic
representation and can be related to the fractional supersymmetry and
$k$-fermionic spin. The equivalence between the quantum affine algebras and the
classical ones in the fermionic realization is also established.
