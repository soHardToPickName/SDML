The statistics of string/M theory vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss systematic approaches to the classification of string/M theory
vacua, and physical questions this might help us resolve. To this end, we
initiate the study of ensembles of effective Lagrangians, which can be used to
precisely study the predictive power of string theory, and in simple examples
can lead to universality results. Using these ideas, we outline an approach to
estimating the number of vacua of string/M theory which can realize the
Standard Model.
