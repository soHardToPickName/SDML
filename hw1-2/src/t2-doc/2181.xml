Type IIB Theory on Half-flat Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we derive the low-energy effective action of type IIB theory
compactified on half-flat manifolds and we show that this precisely coincides
with the low-energy effective action of type IIA theory compactified on a
Calabi-Yau manifold in the presence of NS three-form fluxes. We provide in this
way a further check of the recently formulated conjecture that half-flat
manifolds appear as mirror partners of Calabi-Yau manifolds when NS fluxes are
turned on.
