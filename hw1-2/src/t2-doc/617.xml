Comments on Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory on a Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  D0-brane theory on a torus with a nonvanishing B field is embedded into a
string theory in the weak coupling limit. It is shown that the usual
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on a noncommutative torus can not be the whole
story. The Born-Infeld action survives the noncommutative torus limit.
