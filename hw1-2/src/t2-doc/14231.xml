Confinement of neutral fermions by a pseudoscalar double-step potential
  in (1+1) dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of confinement of neutral fermions in two-dimensional space-time
is approached with a pseudoscalar double-step potential in the Dirac equation.
Bound-state solutions are obtained when the coupling is of sufficient
intensity. The confinement is made plausible by arguments based on effective
mass and anomalous magnetic interaction.
