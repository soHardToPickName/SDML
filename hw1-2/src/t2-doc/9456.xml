Directly Interacting Massless Particles - a Twistor Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  Twistor phase spaces are used to provide a general description of the
dynamics of a finite number of directly interacting massless spinning particles
forming a closed relativistic massive and spinning system with an internal
structure. A Poincare invariant canonical quantization of the so obtained
twistor phase space dynamics is performed.
