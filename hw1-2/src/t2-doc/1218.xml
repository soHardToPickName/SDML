Discrete torsion orbifolds and D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  D-branes on orbifolds with and without discrete torsion are analysed in a
unified way using the boundary state formalism. For the example of the Z2 x Z2
orbifold it is found that both the theory with and without discrete torsion
possess D-branes whose world-volume carries conventional and projective
representations of the orbifold group. The resulting D-brane spectrum is shown
to be consistent with T-duality.
