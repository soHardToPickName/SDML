Unitary Matrix Models with a topological term and discrete time Toda
  equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the full unitary matrix models. Introducing a new term $l log U$, l
plays the role of the discrete time. On the other hand, the full unitary matrix
model contains a topological term. In the continuous limit it gives rise to a
phase transition at $\theta=\pi$. The ground state is characterize by the
discrete time l. The discrete time l plays like the instanton number.
