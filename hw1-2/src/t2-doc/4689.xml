Quiver Gauge Theory and Unification at About 4 TeV
</title>

<abstract>
  The use of the AdS/CFT correspondence to arrive at quiver gauge field
theories is dicussed, focusing on the orbifolded case without supersymmetry. An
abelian orbifold with the finite group $Z_{p}$ can give rise to a $G = SU(N)^p$
gauge group with chiral fermions and complex scalars in different
bi-fundamental representations of $G$. The precision measurements at the $Z$
resonance suggest the values $p = 12$ and $N = 3$, and a unifications scale
$M_U \sim 4$ TeV.The robustness and predictivity of such grand unification is
discussed.
