Chiral Restoration in the Early Universe: Pion Halo in the Sky
</title>

<abstract>
< \psibarpsi > vanishing above $T_c$ indicates chiral symmetry restoration at
high $T$. But is it the old $T=0$ chiral symmetry that is `restored'? In this
talk, I report on the spacetime quantization of the BPFTW effective action for
quarks in a hot environ. The fermion propagator is known to give a
pseudo-Lorentz invariant particle pole as well as new spacelike cuts. Our
quantization shows that the spacelike cuts directly lead to a thermal vacuum
that is a generalized NJL state, with a curious $90^{o}$ phase. This $90^{o}$
is responsible for < \psibarpsi > vanishing at high $T$. The thermal vacuum is
invariant under a new chiral charge, but continues to break the old zero
temperature chirality. Our quantization suggests a new class of order
parameters that probe the physics of these spacelike cuts. In usual scenario,
the pion dissociates in the early alphabet soup. With this new understanding of
the thermal vacuum, the pion remains a Nambu-Goldstone particle at high $T$,
and will not dissociate. It propagates at the speed of light but with a halo.
