Generalized Hirota Equations in Models of 2D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a set of bilinear functional equations of Hirota type for the
partition functions of the $sl(2)$ related integrable statistical models
defined on a random lattice. These equations are obtained as deformations of
the Hirota equations for the KP integrable hierarchy, which are satisfied by
the partition function of the ensemble of planar graphs.
