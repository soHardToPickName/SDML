The Signature Triality of Majorana-Weyl Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  Higher dimensional Majorana-Weyl spacetimes present space-time dualities
which are induced by the Spin(8) triality automorphisms. Different signature
versions of theories such as 10-dimensional SYM's, superstrings, five-branes,
F-theory, are shown to be interconnected via the S_3 permutation group.
Bilinear and trilinear invariants under space-time triality are introduced and
their possible relevance in building models possessing a space-versus-time
exchange symmetry is discussed. Moreover the Cartan's ``vector/chiral
spinor/antichiral spinor" triality of SO(8) and SO(4,4) is analyzed in detail
and explicit formulas are produced in a Majorana-Weyl basis. This paper is the
extended version of hep-th/9907148.
