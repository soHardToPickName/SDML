Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics of Monopoles in N=4 Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A supersymmetric collective coordinate expansion of the monopole solution of
$N=4$ Yang-Mills theory is performed resulting in an $N=4$ supersymmetric
quantum mechanics on the moduli space of monopole solutions.
