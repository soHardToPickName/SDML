S-duality and Compactification of type IIB Superstring Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The SL(2,R) invaraint ten dimensional type IIB superstring effective
action is compactified on a torus to D spacetime dimensions. The transformation
properties of scalar, vector and tensor fields, appearing after the dimensional
reduction, are obtained in order to maintain the SL(2,R)} invariance of
the reduced effective action. The symmetry of the action enables one to
generate new string vacua from known configurations. As illustrative examples,
new black hole solutions are obtained in five and four dimensions from a given
set of solutions of the equations of motion.
