Stable Topological Skyrmions on the 2D Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
In the continuum O(3) sigma model in two spatial dimensions, there are
topological solitons whose size can be stabilized by adding Skyrme and
potential terms. This paper describes a lattice version, namely a natural way
of modifying the 2d Heisenberg model to achieve topological stability on the
lattice.
