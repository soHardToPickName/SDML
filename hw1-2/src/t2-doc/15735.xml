Global effects in quaternionic quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present some striking global consequences of a model quaternionic quantum
field theory which is locally complex. We show how making the quaternionic
structure a dynamical quantity naturally leads to the prediction of cosmic
strings and non-baryonic hot dark matter candidates.
