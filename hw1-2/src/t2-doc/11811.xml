Entropy of Extremal Black Holes in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Entropy for two dimensional extremal black holes is computed explicitly in a
finite-space formulation of the black hole thermodynamics and is shown to be
zero {\it locally}. Our results are in conformity with the recent one by
Hawking et al in four dimensions.
