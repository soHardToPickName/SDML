On Brane Actions and Superembeddings
</title>

<abstract>
  Actions for branes, with or without worldsurface gauge fields, are discussed
in a unified framework. A simple algorithm is given for constructing the
component Green-Schwarz actions. Superspace actions are also discussed. Three
examples are given to illustrate the general procedure: the membrane in D=11
and the D2-brane, which both have on-shell worldsurface supermultiplets, and
the membrane in D=4, which has an off-shell multiplet.
