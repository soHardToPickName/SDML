q-Deformed Kink Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  The q-deformed kink of the $\lambda\phi^4-$model is obtained via the
normalisable ground state eigenfunction of a fluctuation operator associated
with the q-deformed hyperbolic functions. The kink mass, the bosonic zero-mode
and the q-deformed potential in 1+1 dimensions are found.
