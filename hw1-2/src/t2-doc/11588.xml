Evidence for Non-perturbative String Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory appears to admit a group of discrete field transformations --
called $S$ dualities -- as exact non-perturbative quantum symmetries.
Mathematically, they are rather analogous to the better-known $T$ duality
symmetries, which hold perturbatively. In this talk the evidence for $S$
duality is reviewed and some speculations are presented.
