Some Useful Formulas in Nonlinear Sigma Models in (1+2)-Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We give in this paper some formulas which are useful in the construction of
nontrivial conserved currents for submodels of CP^1-model or QP^1-model in
(1+2) dimensions.
  These are full generalization of our results in the previous paper 
(hep-th/9802105).
