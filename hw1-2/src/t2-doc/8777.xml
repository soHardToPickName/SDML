The Hadamard Function and the Feynman Propagator in the AdS/CFT
  Correspondence

<abstract>
  We construct the retarded Green function and the Hadamard function in the
Lorentzian (d+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime for the Poincar\'e
coordinate by performing the mode integration directly. We explore the
structure of singularities for the position-space Feynman propagator derived
from them. The boundary scaling limits of the bulk Feynman propagator yield the
bulk-boundary propagator and the boundary conformal correlation function with
an extra factor.
