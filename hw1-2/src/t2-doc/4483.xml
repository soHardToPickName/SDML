A Note on Fluxes and Superpotentials in M-theory Compactifications on
  Manifolds of G_2 Holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the breaking of N=1 supersymmetry by non-zero G-flux when
M-theory is compactified on a smooth manifold X of G_2 holonomy. Gukov has
proposed a superpotential W to describe this breaking in the low-energy
effective theory. We check this proposal by comparing the bosonic potential
implied by W with the corresponding potential deduced from the
eleven-dimensional supergravity action. One interesting aspect of this check is
that, though W depends explicitly only on G-flux supported on X, W also
describes the breaking of supersymmetry by G-flux transverse to X.
