Infrared and ultraviolet asymptotic solutions to gluon and ghost
  propagators in Yang-Mills theory

  We examine the possibility that there may exist a logarithmic correction to
the infrared asymptotic solution with power behavior which has recently been
found for the gluon and Faddeev-Popov ghost propagators in the Landau gauge. We
propose a new Ansatz to find a pair of solutions for the gluon and ghost form
factors by solving the coupled Schwinger-Dyson equation under a simple
truncation. This Ansatz enables us to derive the infrared and ultraviolet
asymptotic solutions simultaneously and to understand why the power solution
and the logarithmic solution is possible only in the infrared and ultraviolet
limit respectively. Even in the presence of the logarithmic correction, the
gluon propagator vanishes and the ghost propagator is enhanced in the infrared
limit, and the gluon-ghost-antighost coupling constant has an infrared fixed
point (but with a different $\beta$ function). This situation is consistent
with Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenario and color confinement criterion of
Kugo and Ojima.
