Large Extra Dimensions and Noncommutative Geometry in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The consequences of noncommutativity of space coordinates of string theory in
the proposed large extra dimension solution to the hierarchy problem are
explored; in particular the large dimension stabilization and the graviton
reabsorption in the brane are considered.
