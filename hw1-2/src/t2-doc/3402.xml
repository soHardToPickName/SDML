De-singularization by rotation
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider certain BPS supergravity solutions of string theory which have
singularities and we show that the singularity goes away when we add angular
momentum. These smooth solutions enable us to obtain {\it global} $AdS_3$ as
the near horizon geometry of a BPS brane system in an asymptotically flat
space.
