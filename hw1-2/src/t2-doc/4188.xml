One-Instanton Calculations in $N=2$ Supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the one-instanton contribution to the prepotential in $N=2$
supersymmetric $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory from the microscopic viewpoint. We
find that the holomorphy argument simplifies the group integrations of the
instanton configurations. For $N_{c}=3$, the result agrees with the exact
solution.
