A Novel Symmetry in Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of non-linear sigma models possessing a new symmetry is identified.
The same symmetry is also present in Chern-Simons theories. This hints at a
possible topological origin for this class of sigma models. The non-linear
sigma models obtained by non-Abelian duality are a particular case in this
class.
