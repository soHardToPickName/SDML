N=2 Super-Higgs, N=1 Poincare' Vacua and Quaternionic Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of N=2 supergravity we explain the occurrence of partial
super-Higgs with vanishing vacuum energy and moduli stabilization in a model
suggested by superstring compactifications on type IIB orientifolds with 3-form
fluxes.
  The gauging of axion symmetries of the quaternionic manifold, together with
the use of degenerate symplectic sections for special geometry, are the
essential ingredients of the construction.
