Quantum Oscillators in the Canonical Coherent States
</title>

<abstract>
  The main characteristics of the quantum oscillator coherent states including
the two-particle Calogero interaction are investigated. We show that these
Calogero coherent states are the eigenstates of the second-order differential
annihilation operator which is deduced via R-deformed Heisenberg algebra or
Wigner-Heisenberg algebraic technique and correspond exactly to the pure
uncharged-bosonic states. They possess the important properties of
non-orthogonality and completeness. The minimum uncertainty relation for the
Calogero interaction coherent states is investigated. New sets of even and odd
Wigner oscillator coherent states are pointed out.
