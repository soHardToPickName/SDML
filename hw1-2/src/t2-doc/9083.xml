Physics of Strongly Coupled N=1 Supersymmetric SO(N_c) Gauge Theories

<abstract>
  We construct an effective superpotential that describes dynamical flavor
symmetry breaking in supersymmetric N=1 SO(N_c) theories with N_f-flavor quarks
for N_f >= N_c. Our superpotential induces spontaneous flavor symmetry breaking
of SU(N_f) down to SO(N_c)xSU(N_f-N_c) as nonabelian residual groups and
respects the anomaly-matching property owing to the appearance of massless
composite Nambu-Goldstone superfields. In massive SO(N_c) theories, our
superpotential provides holomorphic decoupling property and consistent vacuum
structure with instanton effect if N_c-2 quarks remain massless. This
superpotential may reflect the remnant of physics corresponding to N=2 SO(N_c)
theories near the Chebyshev point, which also exhibits dynamical flavor
symmetry breaking.
