Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking for Massive Spin-2 Interacting with
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  An action for a massless graviton interacting with a massive tensor field is
proposed. The model is based on coupling the metric tensor to an SP(4) gauge
theory spontaneously broken to $SL(2,C)$. The symmetry breaking is achieved by
using a Higgs multiplet containing a scalar field and a vector field related by
a constraint. We show that in the non-unitary gauge and for the Fierz-Pauli
form of the mass term, the six degrees of freedom of the massive tensor are
identified with two tensor helicities, two vector helicities of the Goldstone
vector, and two scalars present in the Goldstone multiplet. The propagators of
this system are well behaved, in contrast to the system consisting of two
tensors.
