Background Harmonic Superfields in N=2 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A modification of the harmonic superfield formalism in $D=4, N=2$
supergravity using a subsidiary condition of covariance under the background
supersymmetry with a central charge ($B$-covariance) is considered.
Conservation of analyticity together with the $B$-covariance leads to the
appearance of linear gravitational superfields. Analytic prepotentials arise in
a decomposition of the background linear superfields in terms of spinor
coordinates and transform in a nonstandard way under the background
supersymmetry. The linear gravitational superfields can be written via spinor
derivatives of nonanalytic spinor prepotentials. The perturbative expansion of
the extended supergravity action in terms of the $B$-covariant superfields and
the corresponding version of the differential-geometric formalism are
considered. We discuss the dual harmonic representation of the linearized
extended supergravity, which corresponds to the dynamical condition of
Grassmann analyticity.
