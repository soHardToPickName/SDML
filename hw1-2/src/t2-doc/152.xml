Fusion in conformal field theory as the tensor product of the symmetry
  algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Following a recent proposal of Richard Borcherds to regard fusion as the
ring-like tensor product of modules of a {\em quantum ring}, a generalization
of rings and vertex operators, we define fusion as a certain quotient of the
(vector space) tensor product of representations of the symmetry algebra ${\cal
A}$. We prove that this tensor product is associative and symmetric up to
equivalence. We also determine explicitly the action of ${\cal A}$ on it, under
which the central extension is preserved. \\ Having given a precise meaning to
fusion, determining the fusion rules is now a well-posed algebraic problem,
namely to decompose the tensor product into irreducible representations. We
demonstrate how to solve it for the case of the WZW- and the minimal models and
recover thereby the well-known fusion rules. \\ The action of the symmetry
algebra on the tensor product is given in terms of a comultiplication. We
calculate the $R$-matrix of this comultiplication and find that it is
triangular. This seems to shed some new light on the possible r\^{o}le of the
quantum group in conformal field theory.
