One-loop corrections to the instanton transition in the two-dimensional
  Abelian Higgs model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an evaluation of the fluctuation determinant which appears as a
prefactor in the instanton transition rate for the two-dimensional Abelian
Higgs model. The corrections are found to change the rate at most by a factor
of 2 for 0.4 < M_W/M_H < 2.0.
