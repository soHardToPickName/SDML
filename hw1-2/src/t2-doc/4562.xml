Two-State Spectral-Free Solutions of Frenkel-Moore Simplex Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Whilst many solutions have been found for the Quantum Yang-Baxter Equation
(QYBE), there are fewer known solutions available for its higher dimensional
generalizations: Zamolodchikov's tetrahedron equation (ZTE) and Frenkel and
Moore's simplex equation (FME). In this paper, we present families of solutions
to FME which may help us to understand more about higher dimensional
generalization of QYBE.
