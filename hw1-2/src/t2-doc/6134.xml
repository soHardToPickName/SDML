Pre-big bang in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a simple cosmological model derived from M-theory. Three
assumptions lead naturally to a pre-big bang scenario: (a) 11-dimensional
supergravity describes the low-energy world; (b) non-gravitational fields live
on a three-dimensional brane; and (c) asymptotically past triviality.
