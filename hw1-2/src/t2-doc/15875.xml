Remarks on Thermal Strings outside Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the semiclassical approximation to the level density of (super)
strings propagating in non-compact coset manifolds $G/H$. We show that the WKB
ansatz agrees with heuristic red-shift arguments with respect to the ``exact"
sigma model metric, up to some deviations from minimal coupling, parametrized
by the dilaton. This approximation is used to study thermal ensembles of free
strings in black holes, with the ``brick wall" regularization of `t Hooft. In
two dimensions the entropy diverges logarithmically with the horizon thickness,
and a local Hagedorn transition occurs in higher dimensional models. We also
observe that supersymmetry improves the regularity of strings at the horizon.
