The Self-Dual Critical N=2 String
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the covariant quantization of the closed fermionic string with (2,2)
extended world-sheet supersymmetry on R^{2,2}. Results on n-point scattering
amplitudes are presented, for tree- and one-loop world-sheets with arbitrary
Maxwell instanton number. I elaborate the connection between Maxwell moduli,
spectral flow, and instantons. It is argued that the latter serve to extend the
Lorentz symmetry from U(1,1) to SO(2,2) by undoing the choice of spacetime
complex structure.
