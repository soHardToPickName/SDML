Quantum Deformed $su(m|n)$ Algebra and Superconformal Algebra on Quantum
  Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a deformed $su(m|n)$ algebra on a quantum superspace. Some
interesting aspects of the deformed algebra are shown. As an application of the
deformed algebra we construct a deformed superconformal algebra. {}From the
deformed $su(1|4)$ algebra, we derive deformed Lorentz, translation of
Minkowski space, $iso(2,2)$ and its supersymmetric algebras as closed
subalgebras with consistent automorphisms.
