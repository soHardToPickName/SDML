q-NONLINEARITY, DEFORMATIONS AND PLANCK DISTRIBUTION
</title>

<abstract>
q-deformed nonlinear field equations are constructed including Klein-Gordon and
Maxwell equations. The q-deformation is interpreted as mathematical structure
describing specific nonlinearity for which frequency of vibration exponentially
depends on the energy
