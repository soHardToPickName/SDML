Complex singularities of the critical potential in the large-N limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We show with two numerical examples that the conventional expansion in powers
of the field for the critical potential of 3-dimensional O(N) models in the
large-N limit, does not converge for values of phi^2 larger than some critical
value. This can be explained by the existence of conjugated branch points in
the complex phi^2 plane. Pade approximants [L+3/L] for the critical potential
apparently converge at large phi^2. This allows high-precision calculation of
the fixed point in a more suitable set of coordinates. We argue that the
singularities are generic and not an artifact of the large-N limit. We show
that ignoring these singularities may lead to inaccurate approximations.
