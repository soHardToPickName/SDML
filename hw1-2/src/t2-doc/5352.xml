Residues and Topological Yang-Mills Theory in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A residue formula which evaluates any correlation function of topological
$SU_n$ Yang-Mills theory with arbitrary magnetic flux insertion in two
dimensions are obtained. Deformations of the system by two form operators are
investigated in some detail. The method of the diagonalization of a matrix
valued field turns out to be useful to compute various physical quantities. As
an application we find the operator that contracts a handle of a Riemann
surface and a genus recursion relation.
