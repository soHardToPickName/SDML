Fermionic zeromodes in heterotic fivebrane backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of fermionic zeromodes in heterotic fivebrane
backgrounds. By solving fermionic field equations explicitly, the normalizable
and physical zeromodes are obtained. The zeromodes have a non-vanishing
gravitino component, and a possible scenario of the gravitino condensation with
the gaugino condensation is suggested.
