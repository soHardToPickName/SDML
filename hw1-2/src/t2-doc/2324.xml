Konishi anomaly and N=1 effective superpotentials from matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the restrictions imposed by the Konishi anomaly on the matrix
model approach to the calculation of the effective superpotentials in N=1 SUSY
gauge theories with different matter content. It is shown that they correspond
to the anomaly deformed Virasoro $L_0$ constraints .
