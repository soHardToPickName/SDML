A Relation between the Anomalous Dimensions and OPE Coefficients in
  Asymptotic Free Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In asymptotic free field theories we show that part of the OPE of the trace
of the stress-energy tensor and an arbitrary composite field is determined by
the anomalous dimension of the composite field. We take examples from the
two-dimensional O(N) non-linear sigma model.
