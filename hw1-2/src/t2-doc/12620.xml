QUANTUM CORRECTIONS AND EXTREMAL BLACK HOLES
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider static solutions of two dimensional dilaton gravity models as toy
laboratories to address the question of the final fate of black holes. A non
perturbative correction to the CGHS potential term is shown to lead classically
to an extremal black hole geometry, thus providing a plausible solution to
Hawking evaporation paradox. However, the full quantum theory does not admit an
extremal solution.
