Analysis of Abelian Gauge Theory with Four Fermi Interaction at
  $O(1/N^2)$ in Arbitrary Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  An arbitrary dimensional expression is given for the anomalous dimension of
the fermion field in a model with a four point interaction and a $U(1)$ gauge
field, at $O(1/N^2)$ within a large flavour expansion in the Landau gauge.
