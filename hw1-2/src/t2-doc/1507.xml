Boundary Sine-Gordon Interactions at the Free Fermion Point
</title>

<abstract>
  We study bosonization of the sine-Gordon theory in the presence of boundary
interactions at the free fermion point. In this way we obtain the boundary
S-matrix as a function of physical parameters in the boundary sine-Gordon
Lagrangian. The boundary S-matrix can be matched onto the solution of Ghoshal
and Zamolodchikov, thereby relating the formal parameters in the latter
solution to the physical parameters in the lagrangian.
