Large\bf $ w_{1+\infty} $--type constraints in two--matrix and
  Kontsevich model--different approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The technique of $Q$-polinomials are used to derive the $w$- constraints in
the two-matrix and Kontsevich-like model at finite $N$. These constraints are
closed and form Lie algebra. They are associated with the matrices, $\lambda
^n{\partial}_\lambda^m$ with $n,m\geq 0$. In the case of two-matrix model they
can be reduced to the $W$-constraints of \cite{8}. For the case of
Kontsevich-like model and two-matrix model with the finite polinomial
potential, the number of constraints are limited by the power of the finite
matrix potential i.e. the spin of $w$-s coincide with that power. This
statement is the natural consequence of the form of constraints.
