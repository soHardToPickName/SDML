Equivalence of Weyl Vacuum and Normal Ordered Vacuum in the Moyal
  Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the features of the vacuum of the harmonic oscillator in the Moyal
quantization. Two vacua are defined, one with the normal ordering and the other
with the Weyl ordering. Their equivalence is shown by using a differential
equation satisfied by the normal ordered vacuum.
