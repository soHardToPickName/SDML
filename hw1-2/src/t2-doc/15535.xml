The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Asymptotically de Sitter Brane Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the brane universe in the bulk background of the topological
AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the brane tension takes larger value than
the fine-tunned value. The resulting universe is radiation dominated and has
positive cosmological constant. We obtain the associated cosmological Cardy
formula and the Cardy-Verlinde formula. We also derive the Hubble and the
Bekenstein entropy bounds from the conjectured holography bound on the Casimir
entropy.
