Applications of special geometry

<abstract>
  We review characteristic features of N=2 supersymmetric vector multiplets and
discuss symplectic reparametrizations and their relevance for monopoles and
dyons. We close with an analysis of perturbative corrections to the low-energy
effective action of N=2 heterotic superstring vacua.
