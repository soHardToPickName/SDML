Probable Values of the Cosmological Constant in a Holographic Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that for a large class of universes, holography implies that the
most probable value of the cosmological constant is zero. In four spacetime
dimensions, the probability distribution takes the Baum-Hawking form,
$dP\sim\exp(cM_p^2/\Lambda)d\Lambda$.
