On the Observability of Quantum Information Radiated from a Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a resolution to the black-hole information-loss paradox: in one
formulation of physical theory, information is preserved and macroscopic
causality is violated; in another, causality is preserved and pure states
evolve to mixed states. However, no experiments can be performed that would
distinguish these two descriptions. We explain how this could work in practice;
a key ingredient is the suggested quantum-chaotic nature of black holes.
