Self-dual Gauged $CP^N$ Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a $CP^N$ model with the subgroup $SU(r)$ completely gauged, where
$1 < r < N+1$. The gauge field dynamics is solely governed by a nonabelian
Chern-Simons term and the global $SU(N+1)$ symmetry is broken explicitly by
introducing a $SU(r)$ invariant scalar potential. We obtain self-dual equations
of this gauged $CP^N$ model and find that the energy is bounded from below by a
linear combination of the topological charge and a global $U(1)$ charge present
in the theory. We also discuss on the self-dual soliton solutions of this
model.
