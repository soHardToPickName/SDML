On the Q-Ball Profile Function
</title>

<abstract>
  We use analytic and numerical methods to obtain the solution of the Q-ball
equation of motion. In particular, we show that the profile function of the
three-dimensional Q-ball can be accurately approximated by the symmetrized
Woods-Saxon distribution.
