Gravity on Noncommutative D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action for the low energy scattering of two gravitons with a
D-brane in the presence of a constant antisytmetric $B$ field in bosonic string
theory is calculated and the modification to the standard D-brane action to
first order in $\alpha'$ is obtained.
