Kappa-symmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld actions in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A superembedding construction of general non-abelian Born-Infeld actions in
three dimensions is described. These actions have rigid target space and local
worldvolume supersymmetry(i.e. kappa symmetry). The standard abelian
Born-Infeld gauge multiplet is augmented with an additional worldvolume SU(N)
gauge supermultiplet. It is shown how to construct single-trace actions and in
particular a kappa-supersymmetric extension of the symmetrised trace action.
