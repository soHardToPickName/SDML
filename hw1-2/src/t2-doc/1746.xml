Gauge Invariance in Chern-Simons Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show explicitly that the question of gauge invariance of the effective
potential in standard scalar electrodynamics remains unchanged despite the
introduction of the Chern-Simons term. The result does not depend on the
presence of the Maxwell term in the Chern-Simons territory.
