Quaternionic Electroweak Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly develop a quaternionic version of the electroweak theory, based
on the local gauge group $U(1, \; q)_{L}\mid U(1, \; c)_{Y}$. The need of a
complex projection for our Lagrangian and the physical significance of the
anomalous scalar solutions are also discussed.
