Remarks on the renormalization of gauge invariant operators in
  Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A simplified proof of a theorem by Joglekar and Lee on the renormalization of
local gauge invariant operators in Yang-Mills theory is given. It is based on
(i) general properties of the antifield-antibracket formalism; and (ii)
well-established results on the cohomology of semi-simple Lie algebras.
