Duality of a Generalized Gauge Invariant Ising Model on Random Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalized gauge invariant Ising model on random surfaces with non-trivial
topology is proposed and investigated with the dual transformation. It is
proved that the model is self-dual in case of a self-dual lattice. In special
cases the model reduces to the known solvable Ising-type models.
