Batalin-Tyutin Quantisation of the Spinning Particle Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Spinning Particle Model for anyon is analysed in the Batalin-Tyutin
scheme of quantisation in extended phase space. Here additional degrees of
freedom are introduced in the phase space such that all the constraints in the
theory are rendered First Class that is commuting in the sense of Poisson
Brackets. Thus the theory can be studied without introducing the Dirac Brackets
which appear in the presence of non-commuting or Second Class constraints. In
the present case the Dirac Brackets make the configuration space of the anyon
non-canonical and also being dynamical variable dependent, poses problems for
the quantisation programme. We show that previously obtained results, (e.g.
gyromagnetic ratio of anyon being 2), are recovered in the Batalin-Tyutin
variable independent sector in the extended space. The Batalin-Tyutin variable
contributions are significant and are computable in a straightforward manner.
The latter can beunderstood as manifestations of the non-commutative space-time
in the enlarged phase space.
