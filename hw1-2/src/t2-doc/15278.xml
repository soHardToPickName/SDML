On The Construction of Zero Energy States in Supersymmetric Matrix
  Models III
</title>

<abstract>
  For a supersymmetric Hamiltonian appearing in the matrix model related to 11
dimensional supermembranes, zero energy states are constructed. A useful
symmetry, and an energy-equipartition property is pointed out.
