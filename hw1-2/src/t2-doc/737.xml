Supersymmetry from a braided point of view
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that one-dimensional superspace is isomorphic to a non-trivial but
consistent limit as $q\to-1$ of the braided line. Supersymmetry is identified
as translational invariance along this line. The supertranslation generator and
covariant derivative are obtained in the limit in question as the left and
right derivatives of the calculus on the braided line.
