Moyal Formulation of Witten's Star Product in the Fermionic Ghost Sector
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we recast the fermionic ghost sector of Witten's open bosonic
string field theory in the language of noncommutative field theory. In
particular, following the methods of hep-th/0202087, we find that in Siegel
gauge Witten's star product roughly corresponds to a continuous tensor product
of Clifford Algebras, and we formulate important operators of the theory in
this language, notably the kinetic operator of vacuum string field theory and
the BRST operator describing the vacuum of the unstable D-25 brane. We find
that the BRST operator is singular in this formulation. We explore alternative
operator/Moyal representations of the star product analogous to the split
string description and the discrete Moyal basis developed extensively in recent
work by Bars and Matsuo (hep-th/0204260). Finally we discuss some interesting
singulariries in the formalism and how they may be regulated.
