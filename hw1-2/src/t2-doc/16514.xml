Quantum Exchange Algebra and Locality in Liouville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact operator solution for quantum Liouville theory is investigated based on
the canonical free field. Locality, the field equation and the canonical
commutation relations are examined based on the exchange algebra hidden in the
theory. The exact solution proposed by Otto and Weigt is shown to be correct to
all order in the cosmological constant.
