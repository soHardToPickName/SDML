Tetrahedral and Cubic Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a numerical implementation of the ADHMN construction, we compute the
fields and energy densities of a charge three monopole with tetrahedral
symmetry and a charge four monopole with octahedral symmetry. We then construct
a one parameter family of spectral curves and Nahm data which represent charge
four monopoles with tetrahedral symmetry, which includes the monopole with
octahedral symmetry as a special case. In the moduli space approximation, this
family describes a novel kind of four monopole scattering and we use our
numerical scheme to construct the energy density at various times during the
motion.
