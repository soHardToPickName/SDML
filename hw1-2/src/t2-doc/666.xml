The Gauss Law Operator Algebra and Double Commutators in Chiral Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate within an algebraic Bjorken-Johnson-Low (BJL) method anomalous
Schwinger terms of fermionic currents and the Gauss law operator in chiral
gauge theories. The current algebra is known to violate the Jacobi identity in
an iterative computation. Our method takes the subtleties of the equal-time
limit into account and leads to an algebra that fulfills the Jacobi identity.
The non-iterative terms appearing in the double commutators can be traced back
directly to the projective representation of the gauge group.
