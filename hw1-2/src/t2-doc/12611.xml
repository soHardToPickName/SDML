Bosonization and Duality in 2+1-Dimensions: Applications in Gauged
  Massive Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Bosonization of the gauged, massive Thirring model in 2+1-dimensions produces
a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory, coupled to a dynamical, massive vector
field. Exploiting the Master Lagrangian formalism, two dual theories are
constructed, one of them being a gauge theory. The full two-point functions of
both the interacting fields are computed in the path integral quantization
scheme. Furthermore, some new dual models, derived from the original master
lagrangian and valid for different regimes of coupling parameters, are
constructed and analysed in details.
