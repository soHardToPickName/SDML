Electrically Charged Vortex Solution in Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain electrically charged vortex solutions for the Born-Infeld Higgs
system with a Chern Simons term. We analyse numerically these solutions,
comparing their properties with those of ``normal'' Nielsen-Olesen vortices and
also show that no charged vortex solutions exist in Born-Infeld theory when the
Chern Simons term is absent.
