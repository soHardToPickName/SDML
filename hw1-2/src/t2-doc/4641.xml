Brane cosmology with a bulk scalar field
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider ``cosmologically symmetric'' (i.e. solutions with homogeneity and
isotropy along three spatial dimensions) five-dimensional spacetimes with a
scalar field and a three-brane representing our universe. We write Einstein's
equations in a conformal gauge, using light-cone coordinates. We obtain
explicit solutions: a. assuming proportionality between the scalar field and
the logarithm of the (bulk) scale factor; b. assuming separable solutions. We
then discuss the cosmology in the brane nduced by these solutions.
