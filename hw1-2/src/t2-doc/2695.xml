2D Extremal Black Holes as Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relationship between two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity
models and sine-Gordon-like field theories. We show that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the solutions of 2D dilaton gravity and the solutions of
a (two fields) generalization of the sine-Gordon model. In particular, we find
a connection between the soliton solutions of the generalized sine-Gordon model
and extremal black hole solutions of 2D dilaton gravity. As a by-product of our
calculations we find a easy way to generate cosmological solutions of 2D
dilaton gravity.
