The N to Infinity Limit of the Chiral Potts Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the N to infinity limits of the N-state chiral Potts model. We
find new weights that satisfy the star-triangle relations with spin variables
either taking all the integer values or having values from a continous
interval. The models provide chiral generalizations of Zamolodchikov's Fishnet
Model.
