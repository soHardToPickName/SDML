Black Hole Radiation in the Brane World and Recoil Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  A black hole attached to a brane in a higher dimensional space emitting
quanta into the bulk may leave the brane as a result of a recoil. We study this
effect. We consider black holes which have a size much smaller than the
characteristic size of extra dimensions. Such a black hole can be effectively
described as a massive particle with internal degrees of freedom. We consider
an interaction of such particles with a scalar massless field and prove that
for a special choice of the coupling constant describing the transition of the
particle to a state with smaller mass the probability of massless quanta
emission takes the form identical to the probability of the black hole
emission. Using this model we calculate the probability for a black hole to
leave the brane and study its properties. The discussed recoil effect implies
that black holes which might be created by interaction of high energy particles
in colliders the thermal emission of the formed black hole could be terminated
and the energy non-conservation can be observed in the brane experiments.
