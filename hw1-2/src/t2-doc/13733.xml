Some comments on S-duality in four-dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a necessary condition, for the partition function of
four-dimensional Yang-Mills theory to satisfy a S-duality property, is that
certain functional determinants, generated by the dual change of variables,
cancel each other. This result holds up to non-topological boundary terms in
the dual action and modulo the problem of field-strength copies for the Bianchi
identity constraint.
