D-Brane Primer
</title>

<abstract>
  Following is a collection of lecture notes on D-branes, which may be used by
the reader as preparation for applications to modern research applications such
as: the AdS/CFT and other gauge theory/geometry correspondences, Matrix Theory
and stringy non-commutative geometry, etc. In attempting to be reasonably
self-contained, the notes start from classical point-particles and develop the
subject logically (but selectively) through classical strings, quantisation,
D-branes, supergravity, superstrings, string duality, including many detailed
applications. Selected focus topics feature D-branes as probes of both
spacetime and gauge geometry, highlighting the role of world-volume curvature
and gauge couplings, with some non-Abelian cases. Other advanced topics which
are discussed are the (presently) novel tools of research such as fractional
branes, the enhancon mechanism, D(ielectric)-branes and the emergence of the
fuzzy/non-commutative sphere.
