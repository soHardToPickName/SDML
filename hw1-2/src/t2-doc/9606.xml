NS Ghost Slivers

<abstract>
  Neveu-Schwarz ghost slivers in pictures zero and minus one are constructed.
In particular, using algebraic methods $\beta$, $\gamma$ ghost sliver in the -1
picture is obtained. The algebraic method consists in solving a projector
equation in an algebra, where the multiplication is defined by a pure 3-string
vertex without any insertions at the string midpoint. We show that this
projector is a sliver in a twisted version of $\beta$, $\gamma$ conformal
theory. We also show that the product of the twisted $b$, $c$ and $\beta$,
$\gamma$ ghost slivers solves an equation that appears after a special
rescaling of super VSFT.
