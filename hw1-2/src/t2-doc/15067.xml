On the twisted chiral potential in 2d and the analogue of rigid special
  geometry for 4-folds
</title>

  We discuss how to obtain an N=(2,2) supersymmetric SU(3) gauge theory in two
dimensions via geometric engineering from a Calabi-Yau 4-fold and compute its
non-perturbative twisted chiral potential. The relevant compact part of the
4-fold geometry consists of two intersecting P^1's fibered over P^2. The rigid
limit of the local mirror of this geometry is a complex surface that
generalizes the Seiberg-Witten curve and on which there exist two holomorphic
2-forms. These stem from the same meromorphic 2-form as derivatives w.r.t. the
two moduli, respectively. The middle periods of this meromorphic form give
directly the twisted chiral potential. The explicit computation of these and of
the four-point Yukawa couplings allows for a non-trivial test of the analogue
of rigid special geometry for a 4-fold with several moduli.
