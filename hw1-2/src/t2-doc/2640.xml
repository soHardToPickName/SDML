Nonlinear differential equations for the correlation functions of the 2D
  Ising model on the cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive determinant representations and nonlinear differential equations
for the scaled 2-point functions of the 2D Ising model on the cylinder. These
equations generalize well-known results for the infinite lattice (Painlev\'e
III equation and the equation for the $\tau$-function of Painlev\'e V).
