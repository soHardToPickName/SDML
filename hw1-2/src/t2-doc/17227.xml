Positivity of Energy in Einstein-Maxwell Axion-dilaton gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Avoiding the problem of the existence of asymptotically constant spinors
satysfying certain differential equations on a non-compact hypersrface we
presented the proof of positivity of the ADM and Bondi energy in
Einstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravity. In our attitude spinor fields defining
the enwergy need only be defined near infinity and there satysfying propagation
equations.
