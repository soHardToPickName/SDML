Geometric Interpretation of the Quantum Master Equation in the
  BRST--anti-BRST Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  The geometric interpretation of the antibracket formalism given by Witten is
extended to cover the anti-BRST symmetry. This enables one to formulate the
quantum master equation for the BRST--anti-BRST formalism in terms of
integration theory over a supermanifold. A proof of the equivalence of the
standard antibracket formalism with the antibracket formalism for the
BRST--anti-BRST symmetry is also given.
