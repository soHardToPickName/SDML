Fractional Superspace Formulation of Generalized Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric (pseudo-classical) mechanics has recently been generalized to
{\it fractional}\/ supersymmetric mechanics. In such a construction, the action
is invariant under fractional supersymmetry transformations, which are the
$F^{\,\rm th}$ roots of time translations (with $F=1,2,...$). Associated with
these symmetries, there are conserved charges with fractional canonical
dimension $1+1/F$. Using \pg\ variables satisfying $\t^F=0$, we present a
fractional-superspace formulation of this construction.
