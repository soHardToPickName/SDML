Spacetime locality in Sp(2) symmetric lagrangian formalism

<abstract>
  The existence of a local solution to the Sp(2) master equation for gauge
field theory is proven in the framework of perturbation theory and under
standard assumptions on regularity of the action. The arbitrariness of
solutions to the Sp(2) master equation is described, provided that they are
proper. It is also shown that the effective action can be chosen to be Sp(2)
and Lorentz invariant (under the additional assumption that the gauge
transformation generators are Lorentz tensors).
