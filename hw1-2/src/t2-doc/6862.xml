Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider and Calogero-Moser Models Represented by
  Sklyanin Algebra and sl(n) Gaudin Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The relationship between Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider (RS) and
Calogero-Moser (CM) models with Sklyanin algebra is presented. Lax pair
representations of the Elliptic RS and CM are reviewed. For n=2 case, the
eigenvalue and eigenfunction for Lame equation are found by using the result of
the Bethe ansatz method.
