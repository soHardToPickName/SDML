Link Invariants from Classical Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking as starting point a perturbative study of the classical equations of
motion of the non-Abelian Chern-Simons Theory with non-dynamical sources, we
search for analytical expressions for link invarians. In order to present these
expressions in a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant form, we introduce a set
of differential forms associated with submanifolds in Euclidean three-space
that allow us to write the link invariants as a kind of surface-dependent
diffeomorphism-invariants that present certain Abelian gauge symmetry.
