Monopole supersymmetries and the Biedenharn operator
</title>

<abstract>
  The hidden supersymmetry of the monopole found by De Jonghe et al. is
generalized to a spin $\2$ particle in the combined field of a Dirac monopole
plus a $\lambda^2/r^2$ potential [considered before by D'Hoker and Vinet], and
related to the operator introduced by Biedenharn a long time ago in solving the
Dirac-Coulomb problem. Explicit solutions are obtained by diagonalizing the
Biedenharn operator
