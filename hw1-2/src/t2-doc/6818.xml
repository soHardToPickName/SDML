Six-Dimensional TQFTs and Twisted Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a generalization of Yang--Mills topological field theory for
Abelian two-forms in six dimensions. The connection of this theory by a twist
to Poincar\'e supersymmetric theories is given. We also briefly consider
interactions and the case of self-dual three-forms in eight dimensions.
