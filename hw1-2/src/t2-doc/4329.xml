Exactly solvable models in 2D semiclassical dilaton gravity and extremal
  black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Previously known exactly solvable models of 2D semiclassical dilaton gravity
admit, in the general case, only non-extreme black holes. It is shown that
there exist exceptional degenerate cases, that can be obtained by some limiting
transitions from the general exact solution, which include, in particular,
extremal and ultraextremal black holes. We also analyze properties of extreme
black holes without demanding exact solvability and show that for such
solutions quantum backreaction forbids the existence of ultraextreme black
holes. The conditions,under which divergencies of quantum stresses in a free
falling frame can disappear, are found. We derive the closed equation with
respect to the metric as a function of the dilaton field that enables one,
choosing the form of the metric, to restore corresponding Lagrangian. It is
demonstrated that exactly solvable models, found earlier, can be extended to
include an electric charge only in two cases: either the dilaton-gravitation
coupling is proportional to the potential term, or the latter vanishes. The
second case leads to the effective potential with a negative amplitude and we
analyze, how this fact affects the structure of spacetime. We also discuss the
role of quantum backreaction in the relationship between extremal horizons and
the branch of solutions with a constant dilaton.
