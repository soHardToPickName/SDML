Gauge Fields and Singletons of $AdS_{2p+1}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that $p$-forms on $AdS_{2p+1}$ describe both singletons and massless
particles. On the $2p$-dimensional boundary the singleton $p$-form Lagrangian
reduces to the conformally invariant functional $\int F^2$. All the
representations, singletons as well as massless, are zero center modules and
involve a vacuum mode. Two- and three-form singleton fields are required by
supersymmetry in AdS$_5$ and AdS$_7$ supergravity respectively.
