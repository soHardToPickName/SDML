Hilbert Space Representation of the Minimal Length Uncertainty Relation
</title>

<abstract>
  The existence of a minimal observable length has long been suggested, in
quantum gravity, as well as in string theory. In this context a generalized
uncertainty relation has been derived which quantum theoretically describes the
minimal length as a minimal uncertainty in position measurements. Here we study
in full detail the quantum mechanical structure which underlies this
uncertainty relation.
