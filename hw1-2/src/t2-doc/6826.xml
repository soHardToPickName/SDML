Virial expansion and TBA in O(N) sigma models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the free energy of the 1+1 dimensional O(N) nonlinear sigma-models
for even N using the TBA equations proposed recently. We give explicit formulae
for the constant solution of the TBA equations (Y-system) and calculate the
first two virial coefficients. The free energy is also compared to the leading
large N result.
