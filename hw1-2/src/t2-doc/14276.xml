Eleven Dimensions from the Massive D-2-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We find an eleven dimensional description of the D-2-brane of the massive
type IIA theory as a first step towards an understanding of this theory in
eleven dimensions. By means of a world-volume IIA/M theory duality
transformation we show that the massive D-2-brane is equivalent to the
dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional membrane coupled to an
auxiliary vector field. The role of this vector field is to preserve the
invariance under massive gauge transformations in the world-volume and has
non-trivial dynamics, governed by a Chern-Simons term proportional to $1/m$.
