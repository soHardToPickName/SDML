The heat kernel on symmetric spaces via integrating over the group of
  isometries
</title>

<abstract>
  A new algebraic approach for calculating the heat kernel for the Laplace
operator on any Riemannian manifold with covariantly constant curvature is
proposed. It is shown that the heat kernel operator can be obtained by an
averaging over the Lie group of isometries. The heat kernel diagonal is
obtained in form of an integral over the isotropy subgroup.
