Exact renormalization group approach in scalar and fermionic theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The Polchinski version of the exact renormalization group equation is
discussed and its applications in scalar and fermionic theories are reviewed.
Relation between this approach and the standard renormalization group is
studied, in particular the relation between the derivative expansion and the
perturbation theory expansion is worked out in some detail.
