M5 on a torus and the three brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the D-3 brane from the point of view of the double dimensionally
reduced M theory 5 brane on a torus. M-theory, IIB identifications are
explicitly constructed and a possible reformulation of the D-3 brane is
discussed. The duality transformation of the reduced 3-brane necessary to make
the identification is discussed in detail.
