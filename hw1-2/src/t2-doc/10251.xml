Conformal Field Theory Correlators from Classical Field Theory on
  Anti-de Sitter Space II. Vector and Spinor Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to calculate CFT correlation functions of
vector and spinor fields. The connection between the AdS and boundary fields is
properly treated via a Dirichlet boundary value problem.
