Diffeomorphisms, Anomalies and the Fefferman-Graham Ambiguity
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Weyl transfomations induced by diffeomorphisms we set up a
cohomological problem for the Fefferman-Graham coefficients. The
cohomologically nontrivial solutions remove the ambiguity and give the nonlocal
terms in the effective action responsible for the trace anomalies.
