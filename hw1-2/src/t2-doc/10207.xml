Massive sigma models with (p,q) supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the general scalar potential consistent with (p,q) supersymmetry
in two-dimensional non-linear sigma models with torsion, generalizing previous
results for special cases. We thereby find many new supersymmetric sigma models
with potentials, including new (2,2) and (4,4) models.
