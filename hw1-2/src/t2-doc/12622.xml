BRST-Invariant Constraint Algebra in Terms of Commutators and Quantum
  Antibrackets
</title>

<abstract>
  General structure of BRST-invariant constraint algebra is established, in its
commutator and antibracket forms, by means of formulation of algebra-generating
equations in yet more extended phase space. New ghost-type variables behave as
fields and antifields with respect to quantum antibrackets. Explicit form of
BRST-invariant gauge algebra is given in detail for rank-one theories with
Weyl- and Wick- ordered ghost sector. A gauge-fixed unitarizing Hamiltonian is
constructed, and the formalism is shown to be physically equivalent to the
standard BRST-BFV approach.
