D-Brane Gauge Theories from Toric Singularities and Toric Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Via partial resolution of Abelian orbifolds we present an algorithm for
extracting a consistent set of gauge theory data for an arbitrary toric variety
whose singularity a D-brane probes. As illustrative examples, we tabulate the
matter content and superpotential for a D-brane living on the toric del Pezzo
surfaces as well as the zeroth Hirzebruch surface. Moreover, we discuss the
non-uniqueness of the general problem and present examples of vastly different
theories whose moduli spaces are described by the same toric data. Our methods
provide new tools for calculating gauge theories which flow to the same
universality class in the IR. We shall call it ``Toric Duality.''
