THE NEW PHYSICS OF STRONGLY COUPLED 2D GRAVITY
</title>

<abstract>
  The strong coupling physics of two dimensional gravity at $C=7$, $13$, $19$
is summarized. It is based on a new set of local fields which do not preserve
chirality. Thus this quantum number becomes ``deconfined'' in the strongly
coupled regime. This new set leads to a novel definition of the area elements,
and hence to a modified expression for the string suceptibility, which the real
part of the KPZ formula. It allows to define topological (strongly coupled )
Liouville string theories (without transverse degree of freedom) which are
completely solvable, and are natural extensions of the standard matrix models.
