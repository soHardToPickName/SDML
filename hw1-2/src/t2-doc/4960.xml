Superspace Representations of SU(2,2/N) Superalgebras and Multiplet
  Shortening
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive massless and massive representations of all SU(2,2/N) superalgebras
by using superfields defined in "harmonic superspace". This method allows one
to easily construct "short superfields" which are relevant in the analysis of
the AdS/CFT correspondence.
