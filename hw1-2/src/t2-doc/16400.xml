The Structure of the QCD Potential in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the screening and anti-screening contributions to the
inter-quark potential in 2+1 dimensions, which is relevant to the high
temperature limit of QCD. We demonstrate that the relative strength of
screening to anti-screening agrees with the 3+1 dimensional theory to better
than one percent accuracy.
