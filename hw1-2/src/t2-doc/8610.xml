Elongated U(1) Instantons on Noncommutative R^4
</title>

<abstract>
  We found an exact solution of elongated U(1) instanton on noncommutative R^4
for general instanton number k. The deformed ADHM equation was solved with
general k and the gauge connection and the curvature were given explicitly. We
also checked our solutions and evaluated the instanton charge by a numerical
calculation.
