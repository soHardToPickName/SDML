The Three-Dimensional BTZ Black Hole as a Cylindrical System in
  Four-Dimensional General Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to transform the three dimensional BTZ black hole into a four
dimensional cylindrical black hole (i.e., black string) in general relativity.
This process is identical to the transformation of a point particle in three
dimensions into a straight cosmic string in four dimensions.
