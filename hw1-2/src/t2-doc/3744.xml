Haploid (2,2)-Superfields In 2-Dimensional Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Superfields in 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspacetime which are independent of
(some) half of the fermionic coordinates are discussed in a hopefully both
comprehensive and comprehensible manner. An embarrassing abundance of these
simplest `building blocks' makes it utterly impossible to write down the `most
general Lagrangian'. With some ad hoc but perhaps plausible restrictions, a
rather general Lagrangian is found, which exhibits many of the phenomena that
have been studied recently, and harbors many more. In particular, it becomes
patently obvious that the (2,2)-supersymmetric 2-dimensional field theory
target space geometries (many of which are suitable for (super)string
propagation) are far more general than Kahler manifolds with holomorphic
bundles.
