More on Screening and Confinement in 2D QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide further evidence for the screening behavior of massless SU(N_c)
bosonized QCD by (i) computing the potential between external quarks, (ii)
bosonizing also the external sources and analyzing the states of the combined
system and (iii) using an expansion in N_f- the number of flavors. We write
down novel "non-abelian Schwinger like" solutions of the equations of motion,
compute their masses and argue that an exchange of massive modes of this type
is associated with the screening mechanism. Confinement for massive dynamical
fermions is shown using (ii) and (iii). We show the screening behavior of the
N=1 super Yang Mills theory, by applying a point splitting method to the scalar
current.
