Dynamical r-matrices and Poisson-Lie symmetries in the chiral WZNW model
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review the possible Poisson structures on the chiral WZNW phase
space and discuss the associated Poisson-Lie groupoids. Many interesting
dynamical r-matrices appear naturally in this framework. Particular attention
is paid to the special cases in which these r-matrices satisfy the classical
dynamical Yang-Baxter equation or its Poisson-Lie variant.
