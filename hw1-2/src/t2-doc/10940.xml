Counting planar diagrams with various restrictions
</title>

<abstract>
  Explicit expressions are considered for the generating functions concerning
the number of planar diagrams with given numbers of 3- and 4-point vertices. It
is observed that planar renormalization theory requires diagrams with
restrictions, in the sense that one wishes to omit `tadpole' inserions and
`seagull' insertions; at a later stage also self-energy insertions are to be
removed, and finally also the dressed 3-point inserions and the dressed 4-point
insertions. Diagrams with such restrictions can all be counted exactly. This
results in various critical lines in the $\lambda$-$g$ plane, where $\lambda$
and $g$ are effective zero-dimensional coupling constants. These lines can be
localized exactly.
