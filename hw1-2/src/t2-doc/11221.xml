Operator Coefficients for Composite Operators in the $(\phi^4)_4$ Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper we derived a relation between the operator product
coefficients and anomalous dimensions. We explore this relation in the
$(\phi^4)_4$ theory and compute the coefficient functions in the products of
$\phi^2$ and $\phi^4$ to first order in the parameter $\lambda$. The
calculation results in two-loop beta functions.
