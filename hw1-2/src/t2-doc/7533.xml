Strings from Logic
</title>

<abstract>
  What are strings made of? The possibility is discussed that strings are
purely mathematical objects, made of logical axioms. More precisely, proofs in
simple logical calculi are represented by graphs that can be interpreted as the
Feynman diagrams of certain large-N field theories. Each vertex represents an
axiom. Strings arise, because these large-N theories are dual to string
theories. These ``logical quantum field theories'' map theorems into the space
of functions of two parameters: N and the coupling constant. Undecidable
theorems might be related to nonperturbative field theory effects.
