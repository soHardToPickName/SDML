D-branes, Categories and N=1 Supersymmetry

<abstract>
  We show that boundary conditions in topological open string theory on
Calabi-Yau manifolds are objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves,
as foreseen in the homological mirror symmetry proposal of Kontsevich. Together
with conformal field theory considerations, this leads to a precise criterion
determining the BPS branes at any point in CY moduli space, completing the
proposal of Pi-stability.
