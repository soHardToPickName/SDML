Topology and Inequivalent Quantizations of Abelian Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
The abelian sigma model in (1+1) dimensions is a field theoretical model which
has a field $ \phi : S^1 \to S^1 $. An algebra of the quantum field is defined
respecting the topological aspect of the model. It is shown that the zero-mode
has an infinite number of inequivalent quantizations. It is also shown that
when a central extension is introduced into the algebra, the winding operator
and the momenta operators satisfy anomalous commutators.
