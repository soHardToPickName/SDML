Small Instantons, Little Strings and Free Fermions

<abstract>
  We present new evidence for the conjecture that BPS correlation functions in
the N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories are described by an auxiliary two
dimensional conformal field theory. We study deformations of the N=2
supersymmetric gauge theory by all gauge-invariant chiral operators. We
calculate the partition function of the N=2 theory on R^4 with appropriately
twisted boundary conditions. For the U(1) theory with instantons (either
noncommutative, or D-instantons, depending on the construction) the partition
function, as it turns out, has a representation in terms of the theory of free
fermions on a sphere, and coincides with the tau-function of the Toda lattice
hierarchy. Using this result we prove to all orders in string loop expansion
that the effective prepotential (for U(1) with all chiral couplings included)
is given by the free energy of the topological string on CP^1. We show that the
gravitational descendants play an important role in the gauge fields/string
correspondence. We then identify this string with the little string bound to
the fivebrane wrapped on the two-sphere. We also discuss the theory with
fundamental matter hypermultiplets.
