Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem and Computation of Wilson Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the application of the non-Abelian Stokes theorem to the
computation of the operators constructed with Wilson loop will lead to
ambiguity, if the gauge field under consideration is a non-trivial one. This
point is illustrated by the specific examples of the computation of a non-local
operator.
