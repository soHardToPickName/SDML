An Alternative Scenario for Non-Abelian Quantum Hair
</title>

<abstract>
  Topologically charged black holes in a theory with a 2-form coupled to a
non-abelian gauge field are investigated. It is found that the classification
of the ground states is similar to that in the theory of non-abelian discrete
quantum hair.
