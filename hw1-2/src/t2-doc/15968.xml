The Supersymmetric Two Boson Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize all the known properties of the supersymmetric integrable Two
Boson equation. We present its nonstandard Lax formulation and tri-Hamiltonian
structure, its reduction to the supersymmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
and the local as well as nonlocal conserved charges. We also present the
algebra of the conserved charges and identify its second Hamiltonian structure
with the twisted $N=2$ superconformal algebra.
