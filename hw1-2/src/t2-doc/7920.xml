Is Quantum Einstein Gravity Nonperturbatively Renormalizable?
</title>

<abstract>
  We find considerable evidence supporting the conjecture that four-dimensional
Quantum Einstein Gravity is ``asymptotically safe'' in Weinberg's sense. This
would mean that the theory is likely to be nonperturbatively renormalizable and
thus could be considered a fundamental (rather than merely effective) theory
which is mathematically consistent and predictive down to arbitrarily small
length scales. For a truncated version of the exact flow equation of the
effective average action we establish the existence of a non-Gaussian
renormalization group fixed point which is suitable for the construction of a
nonperturbative infinite cutoff-limit. The truncation ansatz includes the
Einstein-Hilbert action and a higher derivative term.
