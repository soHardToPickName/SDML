A Theory of Spinning Particles for Large N-extended Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit construction of theories of spinning particles, both massive and
massless, is given with arbitrary extended supersymmetry on the world-line. As
an application of our results, we give a universal description of 3D (and via
truncation all lower dimensional) supersymmetric scalar multiplets with
arbitrary N-extended supersymmetry.
