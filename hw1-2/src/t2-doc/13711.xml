Spectra of supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics

<abstract>
  The new method of solving quantum mechanical problems is proposed. The
finite, i.e. cut off, Hilbert space is algebraically implemented in the
computer code with states represented by lists of variable length. Complete
numerical solution of a given system is then automatically obtained. The
technique is applied to Wess-Zumino quantum mechanics and D=2 and D=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills quantum mechanics with SU(2) gauge group. Convergence
with increasing cut-off was observed in many cases, well within the reach of
present machines. Many old results were confirmed and some new ones, especially
for the D=4 system, are derived. Extension to D=10 is possible but
computationally demanding for higher gauge groups.
