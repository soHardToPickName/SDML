Topological Structures in QCD at High ${T}$
</title>

<abstract>
  These days, as high energy particle colliders become unavailable for testing
speculative theoretical ideas, physicists are looking to other environments
that may provide extreme conditions where theory confronts physical reality.
One such circumstance may arise at high temperature $T$, which perhaps can be
attained in heavy ion collisions or in astrophysical settings. It is natural
therefore to examine the high-temperature behavior of the standard model, and
here I shall report on recent progress in constructing the high-$T$ limit
of~QCD.
