Transfer Matrix Formalism for Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity and
  Fractal Structures of Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a transfer matrix formalism for two-dimensional pure gravity. By
taking the continuum limit, we obtain a "Hamiltonian formalism'' in which the
geodesic distance plays the role of time. Applying this formalism, we obtain a
universal function which describes the fractal structures of two dimensional
quantum gravity in the continuum limit.
