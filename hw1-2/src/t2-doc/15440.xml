Effective actions with fixed points, (error in derivation of coefficient
  corrected)
</title>

<abstract>
  The specific form of the constant term in the asymptotic expansion of the
heat-kernel on an axially-symmetric space with a codimension two fixed-point
set of conical singularities is used to determine the associated conformal
change of the effective action in four dimensions. Another derivation of the
relevant coefficient is presented.
