Domain walls in supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider domain walls that appear in supersymmetric SU(N) with one massive
flavour. In particular, for N > 3 we explicitly construct the elementary domain
wall that interpolates between two contiguous vacua. We show that these
solutions are BPS saturated for any value of the mass of the matter fields. We
also comment on their large N limit and their relevance for supersymmetric
gluodynamics.
