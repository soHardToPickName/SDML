Gauge Theories with a Layered Phase
</title>

<abstract>
  We study abelian gauge theories with anisotropic couplings in $4+D$
dimensions. A layered phase is present, in the absence as well as in the
presence of fermions. A line of second order transitions separates the layered
from the Coulomb phase, if $D\leq 3$.
