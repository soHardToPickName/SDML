More self-tuning solutions with $H_{MNPQ}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We find more self-tuning solutions by introducing a general form for
Lagrangian of a 3-index antisymmetric tensor field $A_{MNP}$ in the RS II
model. In particular, for the logarithmic Lagrangian, $\propto\log(-H^2)$, we
obtained a closed form weak self-tuning solution.
