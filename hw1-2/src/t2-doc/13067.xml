The Gauged WZNW Model Perturbed by the Sigma Model Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss special perturbations of the gauged level $k$ WZNW model inspired
by the $\sigma$-model perturbation of the nonunitary WZNW model. In the large
$k$ limit there is a second conformal point in the vicinity of the ultarviolet
fixed point. At the second critical point the conformal model has a rational
Virasoro central charge which no longer corresponds to a coset construction. In
spite of this fact the perturbative conformal model appears to be a unitary
system as long as the underlying coset construction at the ultraviolet critical
point is unitary.
