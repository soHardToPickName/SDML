Solutions of the Polchinski ERG equation in the O(N) scalar model
</title>

<abstract>
  Solutions of the Polchinski exact renormalization group equation in the
scalar O(N) theory are studied. Families of regular solutions are found and
their relation with fixed points of the theory is established. Special
attention is devoted to the limit $N=\infty$, where many properties can be
analyzed analytically.
