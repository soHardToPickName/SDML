BRST cohomology in Beltrami parametrization
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the BRST cohomology within a local conformal Lagrangian field theory
model built on a two dimensional Riemann surface with no boundary. We deal with
the case of the complex structure parametrized by Beltrami differential and the
scalar matter fields. The computation of {\em all} elements of the BRST
cohomology is given.
