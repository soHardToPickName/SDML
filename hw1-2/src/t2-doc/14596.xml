Supersymmetric Standard Model from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  N=1, D=4 Superstring possessing $SO(6)\otimes SO(5)$ gauge symmetry is
constructed from the open bosonic string in twenty six dimension. Without
breaking supersymmetry, the gauge symmetry of the model descends to the
supersymmetric standard model of the electroweak scale in four flat dimension.
