Gauge conditions for non-abelian Chern-Simons system consistent with
  equations of motion
</title>

<abstract>
  Complete constraint analysis and choice of gauge conditions consistent with
equations of motion is done for non-abelian Chern-Simons field interacting with
N-component complex scalar field. Dirac-Schwinger condition is satisfied by the
reduced phase-space Hamiltonian density with respect to the Dirac bracket.
