A Simple Proof of the BPH Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  A new formalism is given for the renormalization of quantum field theories to
all orders of perturbation theory, in which there are manifestly no overlapping
divergences. We prove the BPH theorem in this formalism, and show how the local
subtractions add up to counterterms in the action. Applications include the
renormalization of lattice perturbation theory, the decoupling theorem,
Zimmermann oversubtraction, the renormalization of operator insertions, and the
operator product expansion.
