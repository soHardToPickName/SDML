BRST Cohomology of the Superstring in Super-Beltrami Parametrization
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for the calculation of the BRST cohomology, recently developed for
2D gravity theory and the bosonic string in the Beltrami parametrization,is
generalised to the superstring theories quantized in super-Beltrami
parametrization.
