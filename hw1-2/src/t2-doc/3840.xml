Nonrenormalizability and Nontriviality
</title>

<abstract>
  A redesigned starting point for covariant \phi^4_n, n\ge 4, models is
suggested that takes the form of an alternative lattice action and which may
have the virtue of leading to a nontrivial quantum field theory in the
continuum limit. The lack of conventional scattering for such theories is
understood through an interchange of limits.
