Energy Eigenvalues of Kemmer Equation for a Homogeneous Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  This article illustrates a completely algebraic method to obtain the energy
levels of a massive spin-1 particle moving in a constant magnetic field. In the
process to obtain the energy levels the wave function was written by harmonic
oscillator solutions.
