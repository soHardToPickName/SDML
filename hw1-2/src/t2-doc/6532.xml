2T Physics Formulation of Superconformal Dynamics Relating to Twistors
  and Supertwistors
</title>

<abstract>
  The conformal symmetry SO(d,2) of the massless particle in d dimensions, or
superconformal symmetry OSp(N|4), SU(2,2|N), OSp(8|N) of the superparticle in
d=3,4,6 dimensions respectively, had been previously understood as the global
Lorentz symmetry and supersymmetries of 2T physics in d+2 dimensions. By
utilising the gauge symmetries of 2T physics, it is shown that the dynamics can
be cast in terms of superspace coordinates, momenta and theta variables or in
terms of supertwistor variables a la Penrose and Ferber. In 2T physics these
can be gauge transformed to each other. In the supertwistor version the
quantization of the model amounts to the well known oscillator formalism for
non-compact supergroups.
