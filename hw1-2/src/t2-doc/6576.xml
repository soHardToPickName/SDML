Klein-Gordon-Langevin Quantum Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a quantum geometric framework for stochastic quantisation in the
case of a free Klein-Gordon field on Euclidean space. In this approach the
noise is part of the background space, spacetime is fuzzy. We extend the notion
of sharp point limit and show how fuzzy spacetime and the Klein-Gordon field
gives the Euclidean space and the stochastically quantised Klein-Gordon field
respectively.
