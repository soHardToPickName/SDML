Three Dimensional N=2 Gauge Theories and Degenerations of Calabi-Yau
  Four-Folds
</title>

<abstract>
  Three dimensional N=2 gauge theories with arbitrary gauge group and
fundamental flavors are engineered from degenerations of Calabi-Yau four-folds.
We show how Coulomb and Higgs branches emerge in the geometric picture. The
analysis of instanton generated superpotentials unravels interesting aspects of
the five-brane effective action in M theory.
