S-wave sector of type IIB supergravity on S^1 \times T^4
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions compactified on S^1
\times T^4, with intersecting one and five D-branes in the compact dimensions.
By imposing the spherical symmetry in the resulting five dimensional theory, we
further reduce the s-wave sector of the theory to a two dimensional dilaton
gravity. Via this construction, the techniques developed for the general two
dimensional dilaton gravities are applicable in this context. Specifically, we
obtain the bosonic sector general static solutions. In addition to the
well-known asymptotically flat black hole solutions, they include solutions
with naked singularities and non-asymptotically flat black holes.
