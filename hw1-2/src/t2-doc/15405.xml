On the Fermionic Quasi-particle Interpretation in Minimal Models of
  Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The conjecture that the states of the fermionic quasi-particles in minimal
conformal field theories are eigenstates of the integrals of motion to certain
eigenvalues is checked and shown to be correct only for the Ising model.
