Generalized Pauli-Villars Regularization and the Covariant Form of
  Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  In the generalized Pauli-Villars regularization of chiral gauge theory
proposed by Frolov and Slavnov , it is important to specify how to sum the
contributions from an infinite number of regulator fields. It is shown that an
explicit sum of contributions from an infinite number of fields in anomaly-free
gauge theory essentially results in a specific choice of regulator in the past
formulation of covariant anomalies. We show this correspondence by
reformulating the generalized Pauli- Villars regularization as a regularization
of composite current operators. We thus naturally understand why the covariant
fermion number anomaly in the Weinberg-Salam theory is reproduced in the
generalized Pauli-Villars regularization. A salient feature of the covariant
regularization,which is not implemented in the lagrangian level in general but
works for any chiral theory and gives rise to covariant anomalies , is that it
spoils the Bose symmetry in anomalous theory. The covariant regularization
however preserves the Bose symmetry as well as gauge invariance in anomaly-free
gauge theory.
