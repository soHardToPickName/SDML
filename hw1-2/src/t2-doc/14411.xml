Ward Identities and Renormalization of General Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the concept of general gauge theory which includes Yang-Mills
models. In the framework of the causal approach and show that the anomalies can
appear only in the vacuum sector of the identities obtained from the gauge
invariance condition by applying derivatives with respect to the basic fields.
Then we provide a general result about the absence of anomalies in higher
orders of perturbation theory. This result reduces the renormalizability proof
to the study of lower orders of perturbation theory. For the Yang-Mills model
one can perform this computation explicitly and obtains its renormalizability
in all orders.
