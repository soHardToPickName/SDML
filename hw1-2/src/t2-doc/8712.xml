Dilaton-driven confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a solution of type IIB supergravity which is asymptotic to AdS_5 x
S^5, has SO(6) symmetry, and exhibits some of the features expected of
geometries dual to confining gauge theories. At the linearized level, the
solution differs from pure AdS_5 x S^5 only by a dilaton profile. It has a
naked singularity in the interior. Wilson loops follow area law behavior, and
there is a mass gap. We suggest a field theory interpretation in which all
matter fields of N=4 gauge theory acquire a mass and the infrared theory is
confining.
