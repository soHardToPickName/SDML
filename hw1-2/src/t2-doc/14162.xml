Anholonomic Frames, Generalized Killing Equations, and Anisotropic Taub
  NUT Spinning Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  By using anholonomic frames in (pseudo) Riemannian spaces we define
anisotropic extensions of Euclidean Taub-NUT spaces. With respect to coordinate
frames such spaces are described by off-diagonal metrics which could be
diagonalized by corresponding anholonomic transforms. We define the conditions
when the 5D vacuum Einstein equations have as solutions anisotropic Taub-NUT
spaces. The generalized Killing equations for the configuration space of
anisotropically spinning particles (anisotropic spinning space) are analyzed.
Simple solutions of the homogeneous part of these equations are expressed in
terms of some anisotropically modified Killing-Yano tensors. The general
results are applied to the case of the four-dimensional locally anisotropic
Taub-NUT manifold with Euclidean signature. We emphasize that all constructions
are for(pseudo) Riemannian spaces defined by vacuum soltions, with generic
anisotropy, of 5D Einstein equations, the solutions being generated by applying
the moving frame method.
