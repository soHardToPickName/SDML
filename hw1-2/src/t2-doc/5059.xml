Asymmetric Non-Abelian Orbifolds and Model Building
</title>

<abstract>
  The rules for the free fermionic string model construction are extended to
include general non-abelian orbifold constructions that go beyond the real
fermionic approach. This generalization is also applied to the asymmetric
orbifold rules recently introduced. These non-abelian orbifold rules are quite
easy to use. Examples are given to illustrate their applications.
