Topological and Nontopological Solitons in a Gauged O(3) Sigma Model
  with Chern-Simons term
</title>

<abstract>
  The $O(3)$ nonlinear sigma model with its $U(1)$ subgroup gauged, where the
gauge field dynamics is solely governed by a Chern-Simons term, admits both
topological as well as nontopological self-dual soliton solutions for a
specific choice of the potential. It turns out that the topological solitons
are infinitely degenerate in any given sector.
