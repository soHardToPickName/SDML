Dimensional reduction of dual topological theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the reduction from four to two dimensions of the SU(2)
Donaldson-Witten theory and the dual twisted Seiberg-Witten theory, i.e. the
Abelian topological field theory corresponding to the Seiberg--Witten monopole
equations.
