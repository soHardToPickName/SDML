Extended Complex Trigonometry in Relation to Integrable 2D-Quantum Field
  Theories and Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Multicomplex numbers of order n have an associated trigonometry (multisine
functions with (n-1) parameters) leading to a natural extension of the
sine-Gordon model. The parameters are constrained from the requirement of local
current conservation. In two dimensions for n < 6 known integrable models
(deformed Toda and non-linear sigma, pure affine Toda...) with dual
counterparts are obtained in this way from the multicomplex space MC itself and
from the natural embedding $\MC_n \subset \MMC_m, n < m$. For $ n \ge 6$ a
generic constraint on the space of parametersis obtained from current
conservation at first order in the interaction Lagragien.
