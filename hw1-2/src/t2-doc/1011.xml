What do Topologists want from Seiberg--Witten theory? (A review of
  four-dimensional topology for physicists)

  In 1983, Donaldson shocked the topology world by using instantons from
physics to prove new theorems about four-dimensional manifolds, and he
developed new topological invariants. In 1988, Witten showed how these
invariants could be obtained by correlation functions for a twisted N=2 SUSY
gauge theory. In 1994, Seiberg and Witten discovered dualities for such
theories, and in particular, developed a new way of looking at four-dimensional
manifolds that turns out to be easier, and is conjectured to be equivalent to,
Donaldson theory.
  This review describes the development of this mathematical subject, and shows
how the physics played a pivotal role in the current understanding of this area
of topology.
