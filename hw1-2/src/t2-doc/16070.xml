Fuzzy Sphere from Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a D0-brane as a probe, we study the spacetime geometry in the
neighborhood of N D-branes in matrix theory. We find that due to fermionic zero
modes, the coordinates of the probe in the transverse directions are
noncommutative, and the angular part is a fuzzy sphere.
