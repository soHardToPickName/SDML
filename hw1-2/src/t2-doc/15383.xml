Asymptotic Conformal Invariance of SU(2) and Standard Models in Curved
  Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  The asymptotic conformal invariance of some SU(2) model and Standard Model in
curved space-time are investigated. We have examined the conditions for
asymptotic conformal invariance for these models numerically.
