Tensor gauge fields in arbitrary representations of GL(D,R) : duality &
  Poincare lemma
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a mathematical framework which provides a generalization of the de Rham
complex (well-designed for p-form gauge fields), we study the gauge structure
and duality properties of theories for free gauge fields transforming in
arbitrary irreducible representations of GL(D,R). We prove a generalization of
the Poincare lemma which enables us to solve the above-mentioned problems in a
systematic and unified way.
