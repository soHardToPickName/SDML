On the Meaning of the String Inspired Noncommutativity and its
  Implications
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an alternative interpretation for the meaning of noncommutativity
of the string inspired field theories and quantum mechanics. Arguments are
presented to show that the noncommutativity generated in the stringy context
ought be assumed to be only between the particle coordinate observables, and
not of the spacetime coordinates. Some implications of this fact for
noncomutative field theories and quantum mechanics are discussed. In
particular, a consistent interpretation is given for the wavefunction in
quantum mechanics. An analysis of the noncommutative theories in the
Schrodinger formulation employing a generalized quantum Hamilton-Jacobi
formalism originated from the polar decomposition of the wavefunction revealed
a formal structure for noncommutative quantum mechanics richer than the one of
noncommutative quantum field theory. Conditions for the classical and
commutative limits of these theories were also determined and applied in some
examples.
