Non-Abelian Momentum-Winding Exchange
</title>

<abstract>
  A non-Abelian analogue of the Abelian T-duality momentum-winding exchange is
described. The non-Abelian T-duality relates $\sigma$-models living on the
cosets of a Drinfeld double with respect to its isotropic subgroups. The role
of the Abelian momentum-winding lattice is in general played by the fundamental
group of the Drinfeld double.
