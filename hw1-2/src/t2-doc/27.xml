Dual Description for SUSY SO(N) Gauge Theory with a Symmetric Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider \caln=1 supersymmetric SO(N) gauge theory with a symmetric
traceless tensor. This theory saturates 't Hooft matching conditions at the
origin of the moduli space. This naively suggests a confining phase, but
Brodie, Cho, and Intriligator have conjectured that the origin of the moduli
space is in a Non-Abelian Coulomb phase. We construct a dual description by the
deconfinement method, and also show that the theory indeed has an infrared
fixed point for certain values of N. This result supports their argument.
