Can Hidden Gauginos Form Condensates?
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetry breaking may be linked to the formation of gaugino condensates
in a hidden sector. In this work, the process of formation of the condensate is
examined in a cosmological context, using an effective field theory of the
gaugino bilinear which provides a reasonable interpolation between the high-
and low-temperature phases. The implementation of anomaly requirements
generates a large potential barrier between the zero-condensate configuration
and that of the true (SUSY-breaking) vacuum. As a consequence, the transition
to bubbles of true vacuum may be subject to an enormous exponential
suppression. This leads to the same difficulties with inhomogeneity of the
universe which occurred in the original inflationary scenarios.
