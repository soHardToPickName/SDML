Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of q-Gauge Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In non-Abelian field theories with q-symmetry groups the massive particles
have a non-local interpretation with a stringlike spectrum. It is shown that a
massless vector similarly acquires a tower of masses by spontaneous symmetry
breaking.
