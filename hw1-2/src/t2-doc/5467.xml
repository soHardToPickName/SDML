A Solvable 2D Quantum Gravity Model with $\GAMMA >0$
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model of discretized 2d gravity interacting with Ising spins
where phase boundaries are restricted to have minimal length and show
analytically that the critical exponent $\gamma= 1/3$ at the spin transition
point. The model captures the numerically observed behavior of standard
multiple Ising spins coupled to 2d gravity.
