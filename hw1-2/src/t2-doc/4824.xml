Nontrivial RR two-form field strength and SU(3)-structure
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss how in the presence of a nontrivial RR two-form field strength and
nontrivial dilaton the conditions of preserving supersymmetry on
six-dimensional manifolds lead to generalized monopole and Killing spinor
equations. We show that the manifold is K\"ahler in the ten-dimensional string
frame if F_0^{(1,1)}=0. We then determine explicitly the intrinsic torsion of
the SU(3)-structure on six-manifolds that result via Kaluza-Klein reduction
from seven-manifolds with G_2-structure of generic intrinsic torsion. Lastly we
give explicitly the intrinsic torsion of the SU(3)-structure for an N=1
supersymmetric background in the presence of nontrivial RR two-form field
strength and nontrivial dilaton.
