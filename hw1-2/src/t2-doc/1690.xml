Time-dependent cosmological constant in the Jackiw-Teitelboim cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the obtainment of a time-dependent cosmological constant at D=2 in a
model based on the Jackiw-Teitelboim cosmology. We show that the cosmological
term goes to zero asymptotically and can induce a nonsingular behavior at the
origin.
