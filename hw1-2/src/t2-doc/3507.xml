Thermodynamics of Relativistic Fermions with Chern-Simons Coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the thermodynamics of the relativistic Quantum Field Theory of
massive fermions in three space-time dimensions coupled to an Abelian
Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field. We evaluate the specific heat at finite
temperature and density and find that the variation with the statistical angle
is consistent with the non-relativistic ideas on generalized statistics.
