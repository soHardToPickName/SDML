Proof of the Impossibility of Non-Contextual Hidden Variables in All
  Hilbert Space Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the algebraic structure of finite Heisenberg groups
associated with the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces leads to a simple
demonstration valid in all Hilbert space dimensions of the impossibility of
non-contextual hidden variables.
