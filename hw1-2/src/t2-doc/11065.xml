Laughlin states on the sphere as representations of Uq(sl(2))
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss quantum algebraic structures of the systems of electrons or
quasiparticles on a sphere of which center a magnetic monople is located on. We
verify that the deformation parameter is related to the filling ratio of the
particles in each case.
