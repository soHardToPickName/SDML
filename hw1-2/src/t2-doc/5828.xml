On the physical contents of q-deformed Minkowski spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Some physical aspects of $q$-deformed spacetimes are discussed. It is pointed
out that, under certain standard assumptions relating deformation and
quantization, the classical limit (Poisson bracket description) of the dynamics
is bound to contain unusual features. At the same time, it is argued that the
formulation of an associated $q$-deformed field theory is fraught with serious
difficulties.
