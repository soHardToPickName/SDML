Gauged Six-dimensional Supergravity from Massive Type IIA
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the complete non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz for the reduction of
the bosonic sector of massive type IIA supergravity to the Romans F(4) gauged
supergravity in six dimensions. The latter arises as a consistent warped S^4
reduction.
