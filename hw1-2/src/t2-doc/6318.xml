Dynamics of Nonintegrable Phases in Softly Broken Supersymmetric Gauge
  Theory with Massless Adjoint Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We study SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with massless adjoint matter
defined on $M^3\otimes S^1$. The SU(N) gauge symmetry is broken maximally to
$U(1)^{N-1}$, independent of the number of flavor and the boundary conditions
of the fields associated with the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism of supersymmetry
breaking. The mass of the Higgs scalar is generated through quantum corrections
in the extra dimensions. The quantum correction can become manifest by a finite
Higgs boson mass at low energies even in the limit of small extra dimensions
thanks to the supersymmetry breaking parameter of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism.
