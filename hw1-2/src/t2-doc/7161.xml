Intersecting Branes, Defect Conformal Field Theories and Tensionless
  Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The defect conformal field theory describing intersecting D3-branes at a
C^2/Z_k orbifold is used to (de)construct the theory of intersecting M5-branes,
as well as M5-branes wrapping the holomorphic curve xy=c. The possibility of a
't Hooft anomaly due to tensionless strings at the intersection is discussed.
This note is based on a talk given by Zachary Guralnik at the 35th
International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary Particles.
