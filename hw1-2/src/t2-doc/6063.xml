Generalized Zeta Functions and One-loop Corrections to Quantum Kink
  Masses
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for describing the quantum kink states in the semi-classical limit
of several (1+1)-dimensional field theoretical models is developed. We use the
generalized zeta function regularization method to compute the one-loop quantum
correction to the masses of the kink in the sine-Gordon and cubic sinh-Gordon
models and another two ${\rm P}(\phi)_2$ systems with polynomial
self-interactions.
