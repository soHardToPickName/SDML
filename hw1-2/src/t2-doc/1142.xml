Twisted partition functions for ADE boundary conformal field theories
  and Ocneanu algebras of quantum symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  For every ADE Dynkin diagram, we give a realization, in terms of usual fusion
algebras (graph algebras), of the algebra of quantum symmetries described by
the associated Ocneanu graph. We give explicitly, in each case, the list of the
corresponding twisted partition functions
