Multicritical Microscopic Spectral Correlators of Hermitian and Complex
  Matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the microscopic spectral densities and the spectral correlators
associated with multicritical behavior for both hermitian and complex matrix
ensembles, and show their universality. We conjecture that microscopic spectral
densities of Dirac operators in certain theories without spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking may belong to these new universality classes.
