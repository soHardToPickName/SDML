TASI lectures on black holes in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a write-up of introductory lectures on black holes in string theory
given at TASI-99. Topics discussed include: Black holes, thermodynamics and the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the information problem; supergravity actions,
conserved quantum numbers, supersymmetry and BPS states, units and duality,
dimensional reduction, solution-generating; extremal M-branes and D-branes,
smearing, probe actions, nonextremal branes, the Gregory-Laflamme instability;
breakdown of supergravity and the Correspondence Principle, limits in parameter
space, singularity resolution; making black holes with branes,
intersection-ology, explicit d=5,4 examples; string/brane computations of
extremal black hole entropy in d=5,4, rotation, fractionation; non-extremality
and entropy, the link to BTZ black holes, Hawking radiation and absorption
cross-sections in the string/brane and supergravity pictures.
