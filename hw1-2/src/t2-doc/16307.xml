String Field Equations From Generalized Sigma Model II
</title>

<abstract>
  We improve and extend a method introduced in an earlier paper for deriving
string field equations. The idea is to impose conformal invariance on a
generalized sigma model, using a background field method that ensures
covariance under very general non-local coordinate transformations. The method
is used to derive the free string equations, as well as the interacting
equations for the graviton-dilaton system. The full interacting string
equations derived by this method should be manifestly background independent.
