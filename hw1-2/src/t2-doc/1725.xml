Large branes in AdS and their field theory dual
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it was suggested that a graviton in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ with a large
momentum along the sphere can blow up into a spherical D-brane in $S^5$. In
this paper we show that the same graviton can also blow up into a spherical
D-brane in $AdS_5$ with exactly the same quantum numbers (angular momentum and
energy). These branes are BPS, preserving 16 of the 32 supersymmetries. We show
that there is a BPS {\it classical} solution for SYM on $S^3\times R$ with
exactly the same quantum numbers. The solution has non-vanishing Higgs
expectation values and hence is dual to the large brane in AdS.
