Shape-invariant potentials and an associated coherent state
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic treatment of shape-invariant potentials in supersymmetric
quantum mechanics is discussed. By introducing an operator which reparametrizes
wave functions, the shape-invariance condition can be related to a
oscillator-like algebra. It makes possible to define a coherent state
associated with the shape-invariant potentials. For a large class of such
potentials, it is shown that the introduced coherent state has the property of
resolution of unity.
