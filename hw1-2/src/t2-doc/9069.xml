Localized instabilities at conifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the M-theory lifts of configurations of type IIA D6-branes
intersecting at angles. In supersymmetry preserving cases, the lifts correspond
to special holonomy geometries, like conifolds and $G_2$ holonomy
singularities. Transitions in which D6-branes approach and recombine lift to
topology changing transition in these geometries. In some instances
non-supersymmetric configurations can be reliably lifted, leading to the same
topological manifolds, but endowed with non-supersymmetric metrics. In these
cases the phase transitions are driven dynamically, due to instabilities
localized at the singularities. Even though in non-compact setups the
instabilities relax to infinity, in compact situations there exist nearby
minima where the instabilities dissappear and the decay reaches a well-defined
(in general supersymmetric) endpoint.
