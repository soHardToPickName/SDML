Symmetry and symmetry breaking in particle physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Symmetry, in particular gauge symmetry, is a fundamental principle in
theoretical physics. It is intimately connected to the geometry of fibre
bundles. A refinement to the gauge principle, known as ``spontaneous symmetry
breaking'', leads to one of the most successful theories in modern particle
physics. In this short talk, I shall try to give a taste of this beautiful and
exciting concept.
