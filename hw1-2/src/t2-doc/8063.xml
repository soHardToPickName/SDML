Exact Gravitational Gauge Structures and the Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact gauge structures arise in the evolution of spin-1/2 particles in
conformally flat space-times. The corresponding Berry potentials can be Abelian
or non-Abelian depending on the mass degeneracy of the system considered.
Examples include de Sitter universes and maximal acceleration.
