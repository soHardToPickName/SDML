Higgs Mass and Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the description of the electroweak interactions based on
noncommutative geometry of a continuous and a discrete space gives no special
relations between the Higgs mass and other parameters of the model. We prove
that there exists a gauge invariant term, linear in the curvature, which is
trivial in the standard differential geometry but nontrivial in the case of the
discrete geometry. The relations could appear only if one neglects this term,
otherwise one gets the Lagrangian of the Standard model with the exact number
of free parameters.
