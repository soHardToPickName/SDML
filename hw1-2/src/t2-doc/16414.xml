Bits and Pieces in Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  These are notes of my lectures held at the first School & Workshop on
Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and its Applications, September 2001 in
Tehran, Iran.
  These notes cover only selected parts of the by now quite extensive knowledge
on logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular, I discuss the proper
generalization of null vectors towards the logarithmic case, and how these can
be used to compute correlation functions. My other main topic is modular
invariance, where I discuss the problem of the generalization of characters in
the case of indecomposable representations, a proposal for a Verlinde formula
for fusion rules and identities relating the partition functions of logarithmic
conformal field theories to such of well known ordinary conformal field
theories.
  These two main topics are complemented by some remarks on ghost systems, the
Haldane-Rezayi fractional quantum Hall state, and the relation of these two to
the logarithmic c=-2 theory.
