HeatK: A Mathematica Program for Computing Heat Kernel Coefficients
</title>

<abstract>
  Heat kernel coefficients encode the short distance behavior of propagators in
the presence of background fields, and are thus useful in quantum field theory.
We present a Mathematica program for computing these coefficients and their
derivatives, based on an algorithm by Avramidi\cite{Avramidi:npb91}. See
http://fermi.pha.jhu.edu/~booth/HeatK/ for source and examples.
