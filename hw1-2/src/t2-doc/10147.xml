SU3 isoscalar factors
</title>

<abstract>
  A summary of the properties of the Wigner Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and
isoscalar factors for the group SU3 in the SU2$\otimes$U1 decomposition is
presented. The outer degeneracy problem is discussed in detail with a proof of
a conjecture (Braunschweig's) which has been the basis of previous work on the
SU3 coupling coefficients. Recursion relations obeyed by the SU3 isoscalar
factors are produced, along with an algorithm which allows numerical
determination of the factors from the recursion relations. The algorithm
produces isoscalar factors which share all the symmetry properties under
permutation of states and conjugation which are familiar from the SU2 case. The
full set of symmetry properties for the SU3 Wigner-Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
and isoscalar factors are displayed.
