The Pivotal Role of Causality in Local Quantum Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article an attempt is made to present very recent conceptual and
computational developments in QFT as new manifestations of old and well
establihed physical principles. The vehicle for converting the
quantum-algebraic aspects of local quantum physics into more classical
geometric structures is the modular theory of Tomita. As the above named
laureate to whom I have dedicated has shown together with his collaborator for
the first time in sufficient generality, its use in physics goes through
Einstein causality. This line of research recently gained momentum when it was
realized that it is not only of structural and conceptual innovative power (see
section 4), but also promises to be a new computational road into
nonperturbative QFT (section 5) which, picturesquely speaking, enters the
subject on the extreme opposite (noncommutative) side.
