Renormalization Group Flow of Four-fermi with Chern-Simons Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce Chern-Simons interaction into the three dimensional four-fermi
theory, ad suggest a possible line of non-Gaussian infrared stable fixed points
of the four-fermi operator, this line is characterized by the Chern-Simons
coupling.
