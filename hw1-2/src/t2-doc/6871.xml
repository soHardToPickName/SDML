Energy Levels and Wave Functions of Vector Bosons in Homogeneous
  Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We aimed to obtain the energy levels of spin-1 particles moving in a constant
magnetic field. The method used here is completely algebraic. In the process to
obtain the energy levels the wave function is choosen in terms of Laguerre
Polynomials.
