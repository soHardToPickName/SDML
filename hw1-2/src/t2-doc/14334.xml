Topological Field Theory approach to the Generalized Benney Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  The integrability of the generalized Benney hierarchy with three primary
fields is investigated from the point of view of two-dimensional topological
field theories coupled to gravity. The associated primary free energy and
correlation functions at genus zero are obtained via Landau-Ginzburg
formulation and the string equation is derived using the twistor construction
for the Orlov operators. By adopting the approach of Dubrovin and Zhang we
obtain the genus-one corrections of the Poisson brackets of the generalized
Benney hierarchy.
