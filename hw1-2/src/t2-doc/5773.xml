Quantum irreversibility in arbitrary dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  Some recent ideas are generalized from four dimensions to the general
dimension n. In quantum field theory, two terms of the trace anomaly in
external gravity, the Euler density G_n and Box^{n/2-1}R, are relevant to the
problem of quantum irreversibility. By adding the divergence of a
gauge-invariant current, G_n can be extended to a new notion of Euler density,
linear in the conformal factor. We call it pondered Euler density. This notion
relates the trace-anomaly coefficients a and a' of G_n and Box^{n/2-1}R in a
universal way (a=a') and gives a formula expressing the total RG flow of a as
the invariant area of the graph of the beta function between the fixed points.
I illustrate these facts in detail for n=6 and check the prediction to the
fourth-loop order in the phi^3-theory. The formula of quantum irreversibility
for general n even can be extended to n odd by dimensional continuation.
Although the trace anomaly in external gravity is zero in odd dimensions, I
show that the odd-dimensional formula has a predictive content.
