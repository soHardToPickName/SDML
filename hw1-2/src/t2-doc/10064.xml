Decompactification near the horizon and non-vanishing entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  Intersecting D-brane configurations are related to black holes in D=4. Using
the standard way of compactification only the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m black hole
is non-singular. In this paper we argue, that also the other black holes are
non-singular if i) we compactify over a periodic array and ii) we allow the
string metric after reaching a critical curvature to choose the dual geometry.
Effectively this means that near the horizon the solution completely
decompactifies and chooses a non-singular D-brane configuration.
