Two-Monopole Systems and the Formation of Non-Abelian Clouds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the energy density of two distinct fundamental monopoles in SU(3)
and Sp(4) theories with an arbitrary mass ratio. Several special limits of the
general result are checked and verified. Based on the analytic expression of
energy density the coefficient of the internal part of the moduli space metric
is also computed, which gives it a nice "mechanical" interpretation. We then
investigate the interaction energy density for both cases. By analyzing the
contour of the zero interaction energy density we propose a detailed picture of
what happens when one gets close to the massless limit. The study of the
interaction energy density also sheds light on the formation of the non-Abelian
cloud.
