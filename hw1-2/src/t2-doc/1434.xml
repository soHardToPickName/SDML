Classification of constraints using chain by chain method
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce "chain by chain" method for constructing the constraint
structure of a system possessing both first and second class constraints. We
show that the whole constraints can be classified into completely irreducible
first or second class chains. We found appropriate redefinition of second class
constraints to obtain a symplectic algebra among them.
