D-Instantons on the boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  The Maldacena's proposal has established an intriguing connection between
string theory in AdS spaces and gauge theory. In this paper we study the
effects of adding D(-1)-branes to the system of D3- or (D1-D5)-branes and we
give arguments indicating that D(-1)-branes are necessary to describe four and
two dimensional instantons.
