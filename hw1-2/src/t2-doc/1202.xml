On Forms with Non-Abelian Charges and Their Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe forms with non-Abelian charges. We avoid the use of theories with
flat curvatures by working in the context of topological field theory. We
obtain TQFTs for a form and its dual. We leave open the question of getting
gauges in which the form, or its dual, can be gauged away, in such way that the
model has two dual formulations. We give the example of charged two-forms in
six dimensions.
