Solitons on the Supermembrane
</title>

<abstract>
  Energy bounds are derived for planar and compactified M2-branes in a
hyper-K\"ahler background. These bounds are saturated, respectively, by lump
and Q-kink solitons, which are shown to preserve a half of the worldvolume
supersymmetry. The Q-kinks have a dual IIB interpretation as strings that
migrate between fivebranes.
