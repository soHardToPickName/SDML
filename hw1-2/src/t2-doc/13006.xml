Abelian BF-Theory and Spherically Symmetric Electromagnetism
</title>

<abstract>
  Three different methods to quantize the spherically symmetric sector of
electromagnetism are presented: First, it is shown that this sector is
equivalent to Abelian BF-theory in four spacetime dimensions with suitable
boundary conditions. This theory, in turn, is quantized by both a reduced phase
space quantization and a spin network quantization. Finally, the outcome is
compared with the results obtained in the recently proposed general quantum
symmetry reduction scheme. In the magnetically uncharged sector, where all
three approaches apply, they all lead to the same quantum theory.
