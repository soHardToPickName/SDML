Black Holes in Supergravity and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an elementary introduction to black holes in supergravity and string
theory. The focus is on BPS solutions in four- and higher-dimensional
supergravity and string theory. Basic ideas and techniques are explained in
detail, including exercises with solutions.
