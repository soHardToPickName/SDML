On Curvature Expansion of Higher Spin Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the curvature expansion of a the field equations of a
four-dimensional higher spin gauge theory extension of anti-de Sitter gravity.
The theory contains massless particles of spin 0,2,4,... that arise in the
symmetric product of two spin 0 singletons. We cast the curvature expansion
into manifestly covariant form and elucidate the structure of the equations and
observe a significant simplification.
