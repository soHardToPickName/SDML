ADS/CFT String Duality and Conformal Gauge Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Compactification of Type IIB superstring on an $AdS_5 \times S^5/\Gamma$
background leads to SU(N) gauge field theories with prescribed matter
representations. In the 't Hooft limit of large N such theories are conformally
finite. For finite N and broken supersymmetry ($\cal N$ = 0) I derive the
constraints to be two-loop conformal and examine the consequences for a wide
choice of $\Gamma$ and its embedding $\Gamma \subset {\cal C}^3 (\supset S^5)$.
