Quantizing Dirac and Nambu Brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  We relate classical and quantum Dirac and Nambu brackets. At the classical
level, we use the relations between the two brackets to gain some insight into
the Jacobi identity for Dirac brackets, among other things. At the quantum
level, we suggest that the Nambu bracket is the preferred method for
introducing constraints, although at the expense of some unorthodox behavior,
which we describe in detail.
