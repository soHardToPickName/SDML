Large Softly broken N=2 QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the possible soft breaking of $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory with and without matter flavour preserving the analyticity properties of
the Seiberg-Witten solution. For small supersymmetry breaking parameter with
respect to the dynamical scale of the theory we obtain an exact expression for
the effective potential. We describe in detail the onset of the confinement
transition and some of the patterns of chiral symmetry breaking. If we
extrapolate the results to the limit where supersymmetry decouples, we obtain
hints indicating that perhaps a description of the QCD vacuum will require the
use of Lagrangians containing simultaneously mutually non-local degrees of
freedom (monopoles and dyons).
