When Superspace Is Not Enough
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an expanded discussion of the proposal that spacetime supersymmetry
representations may be viewed as having their origins in 1D theories that
involve a special class of real Clifford algebras. These 1D theories reproduce
the supersymmetric structures of spacetime supersymmetric theories after the
latter are reduced on a 0-brane.
