The Physics Inside Topological Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the equations of motion defined over a specific field space are
realizable as operator conditions in the physical sector of a generalized Floer
theory defined over that field space. The ghosts associated with such a
construction are found not to be dynamical. This construction is applied to
gravity on a four dimensional manifold, $M$; whereupon, we obtain Einstein's
equations via surgery, along $M$, in a five-dimensional topological quantum
field theory.
