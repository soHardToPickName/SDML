Defects, Decay, and Dissipated States
</title>

<abstract>
  The worldsheet renormalization group approach to tachyon condensation in
string theory is reviewed. The open string case is summarized with examples,
and closed string tachyon condensation on nonsupersymmetric orbifolds is
examined in detail. The idea that the renormalization group dissipates the
localized states associated to the defect is explored.
