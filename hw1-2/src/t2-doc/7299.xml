A Note on ODEs from Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We give close formulas for the counting functions of rational curves on
complete intersection Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of special solutions of
generalized hypergeometric differential systems. For the one modulus cases we
derive a differential equation for the Mirror map, which can be viewed as a
generalization of the Schwarzian equation. We also derive a nonlinear seventh
order differential equation which directly governs the instanton corrected
Yukawa coupling.
