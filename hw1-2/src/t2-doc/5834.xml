Pseudoclassical mechanics and hidden symmetries of 3d particle models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss hidden symmetries of three-dimensional field configurations
revealed at the one-particle level by the use of pseudoclassical particle
models. We argue that at the quantum field theory level, these can be naturally
explained in terms of manifest symmetries of the reduced phase space
Hamiltonian of the corresponding field systems.
