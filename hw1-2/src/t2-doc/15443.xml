p-Adic desription of Higgs mechanism II: General Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper belongs to the series devoted to the calculation of particle
masses in p-adic conformal field theory limit of TGD. The concept of
topological condensate generalizes the concept of 3-space. Various
hierarchically ordered levels of the condensate obey effective p-adic topology
and fractal considerations motivate the hypothesis that physically interesting
values of p correspond to primes near prime powers of two, in particular
Mersenne primes. This hypothesis relates succesfully the fundamental elementary
par- ticle mass scales to Planck mass scale. The fundamental description of
Higgs mechanism is in terms of p-adic thermodynamics for the Virasoro generator
$L^0$ (mass squared). Massivation follows from the small thermal mixing of
massless ground state with Planck mass excitations. The quantization of
temperature at low temperature limit gives earlier length scale hypothesis as a
prediction. In this paper the general theory of Higgs mechanism is described
and calculation of elementary fermion and boson masses is left to the third
paper of the series.
