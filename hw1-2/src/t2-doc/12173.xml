Counterterms for the Dirichlet Prescription of the AdS/CFT
  Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We illustrate the Dirichlet prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence using
the example of a massive scalar field and argue that it is the only entirely
consistent regularization procedure known so far. Using the Dirichlet
prescription, we then calculate the divergent terms for gravity in the cases
$d=2,4,6$, which give rise to the Weyl anomaly in the boundary conformal field
theory.
