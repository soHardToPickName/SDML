N=2 supersymmetric W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate extensions of the N=2 super Virasoro algebra by one additional
super primary field and its charge conjugate. Using a supersymmetric covariant
formalism we construct all N=2 super W-algebras up to spin 5/2 of the
additional generator. Led by these first examples we close with some
conjectures on the classification of N=2 ${\cal SW}(1,\Dt)$ algebras.
