Solitons on Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the possibility that gauge field configurations on stacks of
parallel Dp branes support topological solitons. We give an exhaustive list of
possible soliton charges for p<7. We also discuss how configurations carrying
the soliton charges can be constructed from intersecting branes.
