QCD-Like Behaviour of High-Temperature Confining Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, contrary to previous string models, the high-temperature
behaviour of the recently proposed confining strings reproduces exactly the
correct large-N QCD result, a {\it necessary} condition for any string model of
confinement.
