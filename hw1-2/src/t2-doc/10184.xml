Holography, a covariant c-function, and the geometry of the
  renormalization group
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a covariant geometrical expression for the c-function for theories
which admit dual gravitational descriptions. We state a c-theorem with respect
to this quantity and prove it. We apply the expression to a class of
geometries, from domain walls in gauged supergravities, to extremal and near
extremal Dp branes, and the AdS Schwarzschild black hole. In all cases, we find
agreement with expectations.
