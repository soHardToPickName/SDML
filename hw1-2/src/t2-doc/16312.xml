String dynamics near a Kaluza-Klein black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamics of a string near a Kaluza-Klein black hole are studied.
Solutions to the classical string equations of motion are obtained using the
world sheet velocity of light as an expansion parameter. The electrically and
magnetically charged cases are considered separately. Solutions for string
coordinates are obtained in terms of the world-sheet coordinate $\tau$. It is
shown that the Kaluza-Klein radius increases/decreases with $\tau$ for
electrically/magnetically charged black hole.
