Branes And The Dynamics Of QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A brane configuration is described that is relevant to understanding the
dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Confinement and spontaneous
breaking of a discrete chiral symmetry can be understood as consequences of the
topology of the brane. Because of the symmetry breaking, there can be domain
walls separating different vacua; the QCD string can end on such a domain wall.
The model in which these properties can be understood semiclassically does not
coincide with supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory but is evidently in the same
universality class.
