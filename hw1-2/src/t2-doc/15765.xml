Bound States of D(2p)-D0 Systems and Supersymmetric p-Cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some issues related to D(2p)-D0 branes with background magnetic
fluxes respectively, in a T-dual picture, Dp-Dp branes at angles. In
particular, we describe the nature of the supersymmetric bound states appearing
after tachyon condensation. We present a very elementary derivation of the
conditions to be satisfied by such general supersymmetric gauge configurations,
which are simply related by T-duality to the conditions for supersymmetric
p-cycles in C^p.
