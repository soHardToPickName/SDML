One Component Dirac Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a relativistic free wave equation on the complexified quaternions,
linear in the derivatives. Even if the wave functions are only one-component,
we show that four independent solutions, corresponding to those of the Dirac
equation, exist. A partial set of translations between complex and complexified
quaternionic quantum mechanics may be defined.
