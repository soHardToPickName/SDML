Gauge theory solitons on noncommutative cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize to noncommutative cylinder the solution generation technique,
originally suggested for gauge theories on noncommutative plane. For this
purpose we construct partial isometry operators and complete set of orthogonal
projectors in the algebra of the cylinder, and an isomorphism between the free
module and its direct sum with the Fock module on the cylinder. We construct
explicitly the gauge theory soliton and evaluate the spectrum of perturbations
about this soliton.
