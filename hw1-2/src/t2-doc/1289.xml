Matrix Description of Interacting Theories in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose descriptions of interacting (2,0) supersymmetric theories without
gravity in six dimensions in the infinite momentum frame. They are based on the
large $N$ limit of quantum mechanics or 1+1 dimensional field theories on the
moduli space of $N$ instantons in $\IR^4$.
