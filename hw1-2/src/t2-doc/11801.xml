Abelian duality in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Abelian duality on the closed three-dimensional Riemannian manifold M is
discussed. Partition functions for the ordinary U(1) gauge theory and
circle-valued scalar field theory on M are explicitly calculated and compared.
Keywords: Abelian duality, three-dimensional Abelian gauge theory,
circle-valued scalar free field theory, quantum field theory on Riemannian
manifold.
