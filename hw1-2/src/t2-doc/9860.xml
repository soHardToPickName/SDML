Topological Quantum Field Theory: A Progress Report
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief introduction to Topological Quantum Field Theory as well as a
description of recent progress made in the field is presented. I concentrate
mainly on the connection between Chern-Simons gauge theory and Vassiliev
invariants, and Donaldson theory and its generalizations and Seiberg-Witten
invariants. Emphasis is made on the usefulness of these relations to obtain
explicit expressions for topological invariants, and on the universal structure
underlying both systems.
