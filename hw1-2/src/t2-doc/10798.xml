Matrix String Theory on pp-waves
</title>

<abstract>
  After a brief review on Matrix String Theory on flat backgrounds, we
formulate matrix string models on different pp-wave backgrounds. This will be
done both in the case of constant and variable RR background flux for certain
exact string geometries. We exhibit the non--perturbative representation of
string interaction and show how the eigenvalue tunneling drives the WKB
expansion to give the usual perturbative string interaction also in
supersymmetric pp-wave background cases.
