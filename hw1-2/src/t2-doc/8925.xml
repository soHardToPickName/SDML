Magnetic Monopoles and the Topology of Gauge Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Lattice calculations performed in Abelian gauges give strong evidence that
confinement is realized as a dual Meissner effect, implying that the
Yang--Mills vacuum consists of a condensate of magnetic monopoles. We show in
Polyakov gauge how the Pontrjagin index of the gauge field is related to the
magnetic monopole charges.
