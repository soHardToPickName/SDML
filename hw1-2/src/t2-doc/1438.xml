New divergences of tachyon in the two-dimensional charged black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the tachyon field in the two-dimensional (2D), $\epsilon<2$
charged black holes where $\epsilon$ is the dilaton coupling parameter for the
Maxwell term. Especially the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor
$\langle T_{ab}\rangle$, observed by a freely falling observer, is computed.
This shows that new divergences such as $\ln f$ and ${1 \over f}$ arises near
the horizon ($f \to 0$), compared with conformal matter case.
