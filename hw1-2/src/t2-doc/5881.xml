D-branes in an asymmetric orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the asymmetric orbifold that is obtained by acting with T-duality
on a 4-torus, together with a shift along an extra circle. The chiral algebra
of the resulting theory has non-trivial outer automorphisms that act as
permutations on its simple factors. These automorphisms play a crucial role for
constructing D-branes that couple to the twisted sector of the orbifold.
