Classical instanton and wormhole solutions of Type IIB string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $p=-1$ D-brane in type IIB superstring theory. In addition to RR
instanton, we obtain the RR charged wormhole solution in the Einstein frame.
This corresponds to the ten-dimensional singular wormhole solution with
infinite euclidean action.
