The p-bar p --> pi_0 pi_0 Puzzle
</title>

<abstract>
  According to conventional theory, the annihilation reaction p-bar p --> pi_0
pi_0 cannot occur from a p-bar p atomic S state. However, this reaction occurs
so readily for antiprotons stopping in liquid hydrogen, that it would require
30% P-wave annihilations. Experimental results from other capture and p-bar p
annihilation channels show that the fraction of P-wave annihilations is less
than 6% in agreement with theoretical expectations. An experimental test to
determine whether this reaction can occur from an atomic S state is suggested.
If indeed this reaction is occurring from an atomic S state, then certain
neutral vector mesons should exhibit a pi_0 pi_0 decay mode, and this can also
be tested experimentally.
