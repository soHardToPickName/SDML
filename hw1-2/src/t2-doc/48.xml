BPS Spectrum and Nahm Duality of Matrix Theory Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  In the Matrix theories compactified on the $d$ dimensional torus with $d = 5,
6, 7$ which are described by the theories of D$d$-branes in the type IIA or IIB
theory on the $d$ dimensional dual torus we analyze the BPS bound states of the
background D$d$-brane with other objects by taking the matrix theory limit.
Through the Nahm duality transformation the flux and the momentum multiplets
for these BPS states are shown to be associated with the black holes and the
black strings respectively from the viewpoint of the weakly coupled type IIA
string theory compactified on the $d-1$ dimensional torus.
