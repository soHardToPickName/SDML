On a New Method for Computing Trace Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  I describe a new method for computing trace anomalies in quantum field
theories which makes use of path-integrals for particles moving in curved
spaces. After presenting the main ideas of the method, I discuss how it is
connected to the first quantized approach of particle theory and to heat kernel
techniques. (Talk given at Journees Relativistes '93).
