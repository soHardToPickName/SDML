Pair Production in a Time Dependent Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  The production of electron-positron pairs in a time-dependent magnetic field
is estimated in the hypotheses that the magnetic field is uniform over large
distances with respect to the pair localization and it is so strong that the
spacing of the Landau levels is larger than the rest mass of the particles.
This calculation is presented since it has been suggested that extremely
intense and varying magnetic fields may be found around some astrophysical
objects.
