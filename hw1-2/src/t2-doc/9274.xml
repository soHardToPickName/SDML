A new Map between Quantum Gauge Theories defined on a Quantum hyperplane
  and ordinary Gauge Theories: q-deformed QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new map between a q-deformed gauge theory on a general
GL_{q}(N)-covariant quantum hyperplane and an ordinary gauge theory in a full
analogy with Seiberg-Witten map. Perturbative analysis of the q-deformed QED at
the classical level is presented and gauge fixing a la BRST is discussed
