Coset Character Identities in Superstring Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the coset character identities (generalization of Jacobi's abstruse
identity) to compact and noncompact Gepner models. In the both cases, we prove
that the partition function actually vanishes due to the spacetime
supersymmetry. In the case of the compact models and discrete parts of the
noncompact models, the partition function includes the expected vanishing
factor. But the character identities used to the continuous part of the
noncompact models suggest that these models have twice as many supersymmetry as
expected. This fact is an evidence for the conjecture that the holographically
dual of the string theory on an actually singular Calabi-Yau manifold is a
super CONFORMAL field theory. The extra SUSY charges are interpreted as the
superconformal S generators.
