Remarks on Noether charges and black holes entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We criticize and generalize some properties of Noether charges presented in a
paper by V. Iyer and R. M. Wald and their application to entropy of black
holes. The first law of black holes thermodynamics is proven for any
gauge-natural field theory. As an application charged Kerr-Newman solutions are
considered. As a further example we consider a (1+2) black hole solution.
