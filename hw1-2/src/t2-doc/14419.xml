Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials
</title>

<abstract>
  Combinatorial $B_n$-analogues of Schubert polynomials and corresponding
symmetric functions are constructed from an exponential solution of the
$B_n$-Yang-Baxter equation that involves the nilCoxeter algebra of the
hyperoctahedral group.
