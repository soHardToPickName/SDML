IIB supergravity and various aspects of light-cone formalism in AdS
  space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-cone gauge manifestly supersymmetric formulation of type IIB
10-dimensional supergravity in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ background is discussed. The
formulation is given entirely in terms of light-cone scalar superfield,
allowing us to treat all component fields on an equal footing. Discrete energy
spectrum of field propagating in AdS space is explained within the framework of
light-cone approach. Light-cone gauge formulation of self-dual fields
propagating in AdS space is developed. An conjectured interrelation of higher
spin massless fields theory in AdS space-time and superstring theory in
Minkowski space is discussed.
