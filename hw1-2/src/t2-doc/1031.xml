Sine-Gordon quantum field theory on the half-line with quantum boundary
  degrees of freedom

<abstract>
  The sine-Gordon model on the half-line with a dynamical boundary introduced
by Delius and one of the authors is considered at quantum level. Classical
boundary conditions associated with classical integrability are shown to be
preserved at quantum level too. Non-local conserved charges are constructed
explicitly in terms of the field and boundary operators. We solve the
intertwining equation associated with a certain coideal subalgebra of
$U_q(\hat{sl_2})$ generated by these non-local charges. The corresponding
solution is shown to satisfy quantum boundary Yang-Baxter equations. Up to an
exact relation between the quantization length of the boundary quantum
mechanical system and the sine-Gordon coupling constant, we conjecture the
soliton/antisoliton reflection matrix and boundstates reflection matrices. The
structure of the boundary state is then considered, and shown to be divided in
two sectors. Also, depending on the sine-Gordon coupling constant a finite set
of boundary bound states are identified. Taking the analytic continuation of
the coupling, the corresponding boundary sinh-Gordon model is briefly
discussed. In particular, the particle reflection factor enjoys weak-strong
coupling duality.
