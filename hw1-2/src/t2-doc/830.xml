Topological Objects in 5D Maxwell Einstein Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter is shown that it is possible to obtain scalar hypersurfaces in
5D N=2 SUGRA where the allowed regions with positive definite scalar metric
have a non-trivial topology. This situation may aid in the construction of
domain wall solutions which confine gravity to 4 dimensions.
