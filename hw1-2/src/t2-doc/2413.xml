FFZ realization of the deformed super Virasoro algebra -
  Chaichian-Presnajder type
</title>

<abstract>
  The q-deformed super Virasoro algebra proposed by Chaichian and Presnajder is
examined. Presented is the realizations by the FFZ algebra (the magnetic
translation algebra) defined on a two-dimensional lattice with a supersymmetric
Hamiltonian.
