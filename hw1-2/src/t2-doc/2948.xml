Solving Gauss' Laws and Searching Dirac Observables for the Four
  Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  A review is given of the status of the program of classical reduction to
Dirac's observables of the four interactions (standard SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)
particle model and tetrad gravity) with the matter described either by
Grassmann-valued fermion fields or by particles with Grassmann charges.
