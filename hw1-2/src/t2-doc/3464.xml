Hypermultiplet Moduli Space and String Compactification to Three
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the hypermultiplet moduli space of the type II string compactified
on a Calabi-Yau space $\bX$. We do this by using IIA/IIB duality in a
compactification of the same theory on $\bX\times \bS ^1$ and by using recent
results on three dimensional field theory.
