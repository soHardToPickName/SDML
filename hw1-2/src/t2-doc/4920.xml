Holography and Stiff-matter on the Brane

<abstract>
  Recently, Verlinde noted a surprising similarity between Friedmann equation
governing radiation dominated universe and Cardy's entropy formula in conformal
field theory. In this note, we study a brane-universe filled with radiation and
stiff-matter. We analyze Friedmann equation in this context and compare our
results with Cardy's entropy formula.
