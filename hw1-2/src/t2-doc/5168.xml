N=1 Heterotic-Supergravity Duality and Joyce Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the heterotic dual theory in four dimensions of eleven
dimensional supergravity compactified on a particular Joyce manifold, $J$. In
particular, $J$ is constructed from resolving fixed point singularities of
orbifolds of the seven torus in such a way that one is forced to consider a
generalised orbifold on the heterotic side. We conjecture that a heterotic dual
exists for all the compact 7-manifolds of $G_{2}$ holonomy constructed by
Joyce.
