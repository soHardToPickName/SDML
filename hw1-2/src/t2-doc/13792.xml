Axion Decay in a Constant Electromagnetic Background Field and at Finite
  Temperature using World-line Methods
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the radiative decay of the axion into two photons in an
external electromagnetic field to one loop order. Our approach is based on the
world-line formalism, which is very suitable to take into account the external
field to all orders. Afterwards we discuss how the calculation could be
generalized to finite temperature.
