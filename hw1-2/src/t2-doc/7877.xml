Bosonisation in any dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  The mechanism underlying any bosonisation or fermionisation is exposed.It is
shown that any local theory of fermions on a lattice in any spatial dimension
greater than one is equivalent to a local theory of Ising spins coupled to a
$Z_{2}$ gauge field.There is a close relation to the description of anyons
using a Chern-Simons term.
