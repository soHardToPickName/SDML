On the Beta Function in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We re-examine perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the beta function
in N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories, make comments on the recent
literature on the subject and discuss the exactness of several known results
such as the NSVZ beta function.
