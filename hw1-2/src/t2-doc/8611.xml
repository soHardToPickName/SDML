Quaternionic Electron Theory: Dirac's Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a one-dimensional complexified quaternionic version of the Dirac
equation based on $i$-complex geometry. The problem of the missing complex
parameters in Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics with $i$-complex geometry is
overcome by a nice ``trick'' which allows to avoid the Dirac algebra
constraints in formulating our relativistic equation. A brief comparison with
other quaternionic formulations is also presented.
