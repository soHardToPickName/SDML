Multi-point Local Height Probabilities in the Integrable RSOS Model
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the bosonization technique, we derive an integral representation for
multi-point Local Hight Probabilities for the Andrews-Baxter-Forrester model in
the regime III. We argue that the dynamical symmetry of the model is provided
by the deformed Virasoro algebra.
