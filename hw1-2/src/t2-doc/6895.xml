Model-Independent Analysis of Soft Terms in Effective Supergravity and
  in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss supersymmetry breakdown in effective supergravities such as emerge
in the low-energy limit of superstring theory. Without specifying the precise
trigger of the breakdown, we analyse the soft parameters in the Lagrangian of
the supersymmetrized Standard Model.
