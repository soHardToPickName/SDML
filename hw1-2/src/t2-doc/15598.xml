Noncommutative Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory in Ten-Dimensions with
  Higher-Derivative Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an action for noncommutative supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in
ten-dimensions, and confirm its invariance under supersymmetry. We next add
higher-order derivative terms to such a noncommutative supersymmetric action.
These terms contain fields as high as the quartic order. This resulting action
can be regarded as supersymmetric generalization of noncommutative non-Abelian
Dirac-Born-Infeld action. Some ambiguities related to field redefinitions are
also clarified.
