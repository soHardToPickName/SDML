Logarithmic two dimensional spin-1/3 fractional supersymmetric conformal
  field theories and the two point functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Logarithmic spin-1/3 superconformal field theories are investigated. the
chiral and full two-point functions of two-(or more-) dimensional Jordanian
blocks of arbitrary weights, are obtained.
