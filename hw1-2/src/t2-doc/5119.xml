Diffeomorphism-invariant generalized measures on the space of
  connections modulo gauge transformations

  The notion of a measure on the space of connections modulo gauge
transformations that is invariant under diffeomorphisms of the base manifold is
important in a variety of contexts in mathematical physics and topology. At the
formal level, an example of such a measure is given by the Chern-Simons path
integral. Certain measures of this sort also play the role of states in quantum
gravity in Ashtekar's formalism. These measures define link invariants, or more
generally multiloop invariants; as noted by Witten, the Chern-Simons path
integral gives rise to the Jones polynomial, while in quantum gravity this
observation is the basis of the loop representation due to Rovelli and Smolin.
Here we review recent work on making these ideas mathematically rigorous, and
give a rigorous construction of diffeomorphism-invariant measures on the space
of connections modulo gauge transformations generalizing the recent work of
Ashtekar and Lewandowski. This construction proceeds by doing lattice gauge
theory on graphs analytically embedded in the base manifold.
