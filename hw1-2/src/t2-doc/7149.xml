A remark on collisions of domain walls in a supersymmetric model
</title>

<abstract>
  The process of collision of two parallel domain walls in a supersymmetric
model is studied both in effective Lagrangian approximation and by numerical
solving of the exact classical field problem. For small initial velocities we
find that the walls interaction looks like elastic reflection with some delay.
It is also shown that in such approximation internal parameter of the wall may
be considered as a time-dependent dynamical variable.
