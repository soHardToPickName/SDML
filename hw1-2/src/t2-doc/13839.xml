Hawking radiation by effective two-dimensional theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently proposed 2D anomaly induced effective actions for the matter-gravity
system are critically reviewed. Their failure to correctly reproduce Hawking's
black hole radiation or the stability of Minkowski space-time led us to a
modification of the relevant ``quantum'' matter stress energy tensor that
allows physically meaningful results to be extracted.
