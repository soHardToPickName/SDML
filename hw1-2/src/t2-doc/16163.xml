Graceful Exit in String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The graceful exit transition from a dilaton-driven inflationary phase to a
decelerated Friedmann-Robertson-Walker era requires certain classical and
quantum corrections to the string effective action. Classical corrections can
stabilize a high curvature string phase while the evolution is still in the
weakly coupled regime, and quantum corrections can induce violation of the null
energy condition, allowing evolution towards a decelerated phase.
