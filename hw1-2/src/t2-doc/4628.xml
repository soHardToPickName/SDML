Higher dimensional Taub-Bolt solutions and the entropy of non compact
  manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the action of a circle isometry group on non compact Euclidean
Einstein manifolds. We discuss approaches to a decomposition of the action and
entropy for non compact manifolds in terms of the characteristics of the orbit
space of a suitable isometry. There is entropy associated with non trivial
cohomology of the orbit space of the isometry, and we consider a class of non
compact solutions for which such contributions do not vanish. To obtain
suitable solutions we generalise the Bais-Batenburg construction of higher
dimensional Taub-Nut type solutions to obtain the corresponding bolt solutions.
We consider the generalisations to non compact solutions of gravity coupled to
scalar and gauge fields.
