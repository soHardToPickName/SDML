Spacetime and the Holographic Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space can be foliated by a family of nested surfaces
homeomorphic to the boundary of the space. We propose a holographic
correspondence between theories living on each surface in the foliation and
quantum gravity in the enclosed volume. The flow of observables between our
``interior'' theories is described by a renormalization group equation. The
dependence of these flows on the foliation of space encodes bulk geometry.
