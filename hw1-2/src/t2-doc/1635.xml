New parity-violating photon-axion interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  A variant of an earlier proposal by the author and SenGupta, to describe four
dimensional Maxwell electrodynamics in Einstein-Cartan spacetimes through a
Kalb-Ramond field as an intermediary, is shown to lead to a new
Maxwell-Kalb-Ramond coupling that violates spatial parity, even when the KR
gauge field has its standard parity assignment. One consequence of this
coupling seems to be a modulation, independent of wavelength but dependent on
the KR field strength, of the intensity of synchrotron radiation observed from
distant galactic sources.
