On State Counting and Characters
</title>

<abstract>
  We outline the relationship between the thermodynamic densities and
quasi-particle descriptions of spectra of RSOS models with an underlying Bethe
equation. We use this to prove completeness of states in some cases and then
give an algorithm for the construction of branching functions of their emergent
conformal field theories. Starting from the Bethe equations of $D_n$ type, we
discuss some aspects of the $Z_n$ lattice models.
