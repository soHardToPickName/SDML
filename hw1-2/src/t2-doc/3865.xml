Real Interquark Potential Between a Heavy and a Light Quark at All
  Distances
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that in infinite spacetime dimensions, the singularity in the
interquark potential at small distances disappears if the string is anchored at
one end to a heavy quark, at the other end to a light quark. This suggests that
if quarks are placed at the end of strings some unphysical features such as
tachyon states may be absent also in in finite dimensions.
