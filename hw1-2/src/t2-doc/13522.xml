Fock Vacuum Instability and Causality
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuum diagram is calculated at second order for theories with
self-interacting massless fields in the framework of finite causal perturbation
theory. It is pointed out that the infrared behaviour of the vacuum diagram
leads to unstable Fock vacua for QCD or massless QED, but not for quantum
gravity. Therefore a radical rearrangement of the physical system must take
place for such theories. Conversely, stability of the Fock vacuum for massless
interacting fields is another hint at the possibility that quantum gravity
should be treated as an effective theory.
