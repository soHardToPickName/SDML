BPS Supermultiplets in Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  BPS representations of 5-dimensional supersymmetry algebras are classified.
For BPS states preserving 1/2 the supersymmetry, there are two distinct classes
of multiplets for N=4 supersymmetry and three classes for N=8 supersymmetry.
For N=4 matter theories, the two 1/2 supersymmetric BPS multiplets are the
massive vector multiplet and the massive self-dual 2-form multiplet. Some
applications to super-Yang-Mills, supergravity and little string theories are
considered.
