Precision "Measurements" of the $Q \bar{Q}$ Potential in MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the M theory corrections to the confining linear potential between
a quark and an anti-quark in N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory. We find a constant
term, and a term exponentially small with characteristic length of
$\Lambda_{QCD}^{-1}$. The potential in the MQCD setup that corresponds to
softly broken N=1 SYM is found to have a similar behavior.
