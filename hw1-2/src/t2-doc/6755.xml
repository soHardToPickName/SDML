Some New/Old Approaches to QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a talk delivered at the Meeting on Integrable Quantum Field Theories,
Villa Olmo and at STRINGS 1992, Rome, September 1992. I discuss some recent
attempts to revive two old ideas regarding an analytic approach to QCD-the
development of a string representation of the theory and the large N limit of
QCD.
