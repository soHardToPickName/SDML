Noncommutative Q-balls
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain Q-ball solutions in noncommutative scalar field theory with a
global U(1) invariance. The Q-ball solutions are shown to be classically and
quantum mechanically stable. We also find that "excited Q-ball" states exist
for some class of scalar potentials, which are classically stable in the large
noncommutativity limit.
