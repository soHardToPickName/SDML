Seiberg-Witten Theory, Integrable Systems and D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note it is demonstrated how the Seiberg-Witten solutions and related
integrable systems may arise from certain brane configurations in M-theory.
Some subtleties of the formulation of the Seiberg-Witten theory via integrable
systems are discussed and interpreted along the lines of general picture of
string/M-theory dualities.
