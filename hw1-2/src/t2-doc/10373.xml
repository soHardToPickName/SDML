Integrable Generalized Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the conditions that the coupling constants of the Generalized
Thirring Model have to satisfy in order for the model to admit an infinite
number of commuting classical conserved quantities. Our treatment uses the
bosonized version of the model, with periodic boundary conditions imposed on
the space coordinate. Some explicit examples that satisfy these conditions are
discussed. We show that, with a different set of boundary conditions, there
exist additional conserved quantities, and we find the Poisson Bracket algebra
satisfied by them.
