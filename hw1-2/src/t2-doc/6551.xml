Light-sheets and Bekenstein's bound
</title>

<abstract>
  From the covariant bound on the entropy of partial light-sheets, we derive a
version of Bekenstein's bound: S/M \leq pi x/hbar, where S, M, and x are the
entropy, total mass, and width of any isolated, weakly gravitating system.
Because x can be measured along any spatial direction, the bound becomes
unexpectedly tight in thin systems. Our result completes the identification of
older entropy bounds as special cases of the covariant bound. Thus,
light-sheets exhibit a connection between information and geometry far more
general, but in no respect weaker, than that initially revealed by black hole
thermodynamics.
