A note on M(atrix) theory in seven dimensions with eight supercharges
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider M(atrix) theory compactifications to seven dimensions with eight
unbroken supersymmetries. We conjecture that both M(atrix) theory on K3 and
Heterotic M(atrix) theory on T^3 are described by the same 5+1 dimensional
theory with N=2 supersymmetry which is broken to N=1 by the base space. The
emergence of the extra dimension follows from a recent result of
Rozali[hep-th/9702136]. We show that the seven dimensional duality between
M-theory on K3 and Heterotic string theory on T^3 is realised in M(atrix)
theory as the exchange of one of the dimensions with this new dimension.
