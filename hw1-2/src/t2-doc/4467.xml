Geometrization of the Quantum Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  A variant of the divergence theory for vacuum-structure developed previously
is analyzed from the viewpoint of a conformally invariant gravitational model.
Invariance breaking is introduced by choosing a preferred configuration of
dynamical variables. In this way a particle interpretation is presented which
leads to the geometrization of the quantum aspects of matter.
