Dynamical truncation of the string spectrum at finite N
</title>

<abstract>
  We exhibit a nonperturbative background independent dynamical truncation of
the string spectrum and a quantization of the string coupling constant directly
from the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics of strings constructed from
Yang-Mills theories.
