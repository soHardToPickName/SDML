About gamma^5 Chiral Interactions of Massive Particles in the
  (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the self/anti-self charge conjugate states of the (1/2,0)\oplus
(0,1/2) representation possess the axial charge. Furthermore, we analyze the
recent claims of the \sim \sigma \cdot [A \times A^*] interaction terms for
`fermions'. Finally, we briefly discuss the problem in the (1,0)\oplus (0,1)
representation.
