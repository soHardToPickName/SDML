D-branes in an AdS_3 background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the possible D-brane configurations in an AdS_3 x S^3 x T^4
background with a NS-NS B field. We use its WZW model description and the
boundary state formalism, and we analyze the bosonic and the N=1 supersymmetric
cases separately. We also discuss the corresponding classical open string sigma
model. We determine the spacetime supersymmetry preserved by the supersymmetric
D-brane configurations.
