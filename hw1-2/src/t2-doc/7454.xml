Gauge and parametrization dependencies of the one-loop counterterms in
  the Einstein gravity.

<abstract>
  The parametrization and gauge dependencies of the one-loop counterterms on
the mass-shell in the Einstein gravity are investigated. The physical meaning
of the loop calculation results on the mass shell and the parametrization
dependence of the renormgroup functions in the nonrenormalizable theories are
discussed.
