Covariant formulation of non-Abelian gauge theories without
  anticommuting variables

<abstract>
  A manifestly Lorentz invariant effective action for Yang-Mills theory
depending only on commuting fields is constructed. This action posesses a
bosonic symmetry, which plays a role analogous to the BRST symmetry in the
standard formalism.
