A pseudo-conformal representation of the Virasoro algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing the concept of primary fields, we find a new representation of
the Virasoro algebra, which we call it a pseudo-conformal representation. In
special cases, this representation reduces to ordinary- or
logarithmic-conformal field theory. There are, however, other cases in which
the Green functions differ from those of ordinary- or logarithmic-conformal
field theories. This representation is parametrized by two matrices. We
classify these two matrices, and calculate some of the correlators for a simple
example.
