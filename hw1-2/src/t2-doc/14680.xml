Perturbative Tamm-Dancoff Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  A new two-step renormalization procedure is proposed. In the first step, the
effects of high-energy states are considered in the conventional (Feynman)
perturbation theory. In the second step, the coupling to many-body states is
eliminated by a similarity transformation. The resultant effective Hamiltonian
contains only interactions which do not change particle number. It is subject
to numerical diagonalization. We apply the general procedure to a simple
example for the purpose of illustration.
