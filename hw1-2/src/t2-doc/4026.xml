Summing up D-Instantons

<abstract>
  We investigate quantum corrections to the moduli space for hypermultiplets
for type IIA near a conifold singularity. We find a unique quantum deformation
based on symmetry arguments which is consistent with a recent conjecture. The
correction can be interpreted as an infinite sum coming from multiple wrappings
of the Euclidean D-branes around the vanishing cycle.
