Holography, inflation, and quantum fluctuations in the early universe
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the relevance of holographic entropy bounds in the context of
inflation is investigated. We distinguish between entropy on large and small
scales and confront the entropy of quantum fluctuations in an inflating
cosmology with the appropriate entropy bounds. In conclusion we do not find any
constraints on inflation from holography, but some suggestions for future
studies are given.
