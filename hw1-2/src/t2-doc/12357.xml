General properties of the decay amplitudes for massless particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the kinematical constraints which characterize the decay of any
massless particle in flat spacetime. We show that in perturbation theory the
decay probabilities of photons and Yang-Mills bosons vanish to all orders; the
decay probability of the graviton vanishes to one-loop order for graviton loops
and to all orders for matter loops. A general power counting argument indicates
in which conditions a decay of a massless particle could be possible: the
lagrangian should contain a self-coupling without derivatives and with a
coupling constant of positive mass dimension.
