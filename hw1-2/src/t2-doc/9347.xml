New N=2 Supersymmetric Vector-Tensor Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  An N=2 supersymmetric self-interaction of the vector-tensor multiplet is
presented, in which the vector provides the gauge field for local central
charge transformations. The dual description in terms of a vector multiplet and
an N=1 superspace formulation are given.
