Confining phase in SUSY SO(12) gauge theory with one spinor and several
  vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the confining phase structure on {\cal N}=1 supersymmetric SO(12)
gauge theory with N_f \le 7 vectors and one spinor. The explicit form of low
energy superpotentials for N_f \le 7 are derived after gauge invariant
operators relevant in the effective theory are identified via gauge symmetry
breaking pattern. The resulting confining phase structure is analogous to N_f
\le N_c+1 SUSY QCD. Finally, we conclude with some comments on the search for
duals to N_f \ge 8 SO(12) theory.
