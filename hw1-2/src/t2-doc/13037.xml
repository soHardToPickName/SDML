Skyrmions in the Quantum Hall effect and noncommutative solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been recently shown that solitons are fundamental classical solutions
of non-commutative field theories. We reconsider this issue from the standpoint
of the Hall effect and identify some solutions with known solutions in the
integer Hall effect with no Zeeman coupling.
