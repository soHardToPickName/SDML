Gauge-invariant Hamiltonian formulation of lattice Yang-Mills theory and
  the Heisenberg double
</title>

<abstract>
It it known that to get the usual Hamiltonian formulation of lattice Yang-Mills
theory in the temporal gauge $A_{0}=0$ one should place on every link the
cotangent bundle of a Lie group. The cotangent bundle may be considered as a
limiting case of a so called Heisenberg double of a Lie group which is one of
the basic objects in the theory of Lie-Poisson and quantum groups. It is shown
in the paper that there is a generalization of the usual Hamiltonian
formulation to the case of the Heisenberg double.
