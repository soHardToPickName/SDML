Quantization of Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Podolsky Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize a generalized electromagnetism in 2 + 1 dimensions which contains
a higher-order derivative term by using Dirac's method. By introducing
auxiliary fields we transform the original theory in a lower-order derivative
one which can be treated in a usual way.
