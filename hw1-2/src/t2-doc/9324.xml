Some stationary points of gauged N=16 D=3 supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Five nontrivial stationary points are found for maximal gauged N=16
supergravity in three dimensions with gauge group $SO(8)\times SO(8)$ by
restricting the potential to a submanifold of the space of
$SU(3)\subset(SO(8)\times SO(8))_{\rm diag}$ singlets. The construction
presented here uses the embedding of $E_{7(+7)}\subset E_{8(+8)}$ to lift the
analysis of N=8, D=4 supergravity performed by N. Warner to N=16, D=3, and
hence, these stationary points correspond to some of the known extrema of
gauged N=8, D=4 supergravity.
