Branes in type 0/type II duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive relations between type 0 and type II D-brane configurations under
the T-duality suggested by Bergman and Gaberdiel and confirm that the massless
fields on D-branes are identical to those on the dual D-brane configurations.
Furthermore, we discuss dualities of type 0 and type II NS5-branes and find
that the dual of an unwrapped type 0 NS5-brane is a Kaluza-Klein monopole with
non-supersymmetric blow up modes.
