Stochastic loop equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Stochastic quantization is applied to derivation of the equations for the
Wilson loops and generating functionals of the Wilson loops in the large-N
limit. These equations are treated both in the coordinate and momentum
representations. In the first case the connection of the suggested approach
with the problem of random closed contours and supersymmetric quantum mechanics
is established, and the equation for the Quenched Master Field Wilson loop is
derived. The regularized version of one of the obtained equations is presented
and applied to derivation of the equation for the bilocal field correlator. The
momentum loop dynamics is also investigated.
