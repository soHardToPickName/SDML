A Candidate for Exact Continuum Dual Theory for Scalar QED$_3$
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a possible exact equivalence of the Abelian Higgs model and a
scalar theory of a magnetic vortex field in 2+1 dimensions. The vortex model
has a current - current interaction and can be viewed as a strong coupling
limit of a massive vector theory. The fixed point structure of the theory is
discussed and mapped into fixed points of the Higgs model.
