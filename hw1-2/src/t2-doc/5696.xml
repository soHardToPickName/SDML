The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Taub-Bolt-AdS Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the conformal field theory which is dual to the Taub-Bolt-AdS
spacetime. It is shown that the Cardy-Verlinde formula for the entropy of the
conformal field theory agrees precisely with the entropy of the Taub-Bolt-AdS
spacetime, at high temperatures. This result may be viewed as providing a
conformal field theory interpretation of Taub-Bolt-AdS entropy.
