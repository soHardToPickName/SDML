Anyons as spin particles: from classical mechanics to field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  (2+1)-dimensional relativistic fractional spin particles are considered
within the framework of the group-theoretical approach to anyons starting from
the level of classical mechanics and concluding by the construction of the
minimal set of linear differential field equations.
