A Note on Nonperturbative Instability in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility that stringy nonperturbative instabilities are
described by worldsheet methods. We focus on the case of open bosonic string
theory, where the D-instanton plays a role of the bounce, i.e. it describes
barrier penetration. In the process, we compute the exponential factor in a
decay probability.
