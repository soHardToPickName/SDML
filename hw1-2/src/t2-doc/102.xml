Realization of the Dirac bracket algebras through first class functions
  and quantization of constrained systems
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a Dirac bracket algebra is isomorphic to the original
Poisson bracket algebra of first class functions subject to first class
constraints. The isomorphic image of the Dirac bracket algebra in the
star-product commutator algebra is found.
