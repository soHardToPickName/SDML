Physical Interpretation Of Certain Strong Coupling Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We interpret certain strong coupling singularities of the $E_8\times E_8$
heterotic string on K3 in terms of exotic six-dimensional theories in which
$E_8$ is a gauge symmetry. These theories are closely related to theories
obtained at small instanton singularities, which have $E_8$ as a global
symmetry.
