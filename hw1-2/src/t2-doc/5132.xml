On the Quantization of the GS Type IIB Superstring Action on AdS3 X S3
  with NSNS flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the type IIB GS string action on AdS3 X S3 with pure NSNS
background and we show that it is equivalent to Liouville with periodic
boundary condition plus free spacetime fermions.
