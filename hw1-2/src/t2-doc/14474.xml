From ADM to Brane-World charges
</title>

<abstract>
  We first recall a covariant formalism used to compute conserved charges in
gauge invariant theories. We then study the case of gravity for two different
boundary conditions, namely spatial infinity and a Brane-World boundary. The
new conclusion of this analysis is that the gravitational energy (and linear
and angular momentum) is a local expression if our universe is really a
boundary of a five-dimensional spacetime.
