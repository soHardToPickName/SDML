Noncommutative Nonlinear Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present noncommutative nonlinear supersymmetric theories. The first
example is a non-polynomial Akulov-Volkov-type lagrangian with noncommutative
nonlinear global supersymmetry in arbitrary space-time dimensions. The second
example is the generalization of this lagrangian to Dirac-Born-Infeld
lagrangian with nonlinear supersymmetry realized in dimensions D=2,3,4, 6 and
10.
