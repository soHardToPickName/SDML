Worldvolume Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A general set of rules is given how to convert a local kappa-symmetry of a
brane action and space-time supersymmetry into the global supersymmetry of the
worldvolume. A Killing spinor adapted gauge for quantization of kappa-symmetry
is defined for this purpose. As an application of these rules we perform the
gauge-fixing of the M-5-brane to get the theory of the (0, 2) tensor
supermultiplet in d=6.
