BRST Cohomology and Its Application to QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the BRST cohomology under a positive definite inner product and
obtain the Hodge decomposition theorem at a non-degenerate state vector space
$V$. The harmonic states isomorphic with a BRST cohomology class correspond to
the physical Hilbert space with positive norm as long as the completeness of
$Q_{BRST}$ is satisfied. We explicitly define ``co-BRST'' operator and analyze
the quartet mechanism in QED.
