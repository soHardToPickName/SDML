Interaction of Non-Abelian Monopole with External Field
</title>

<abstract>
  The interaction of a nontrivial topological field configuration with the
external fields is considered. The approach is based on the calculation of the
zero modes excitation probability. We consider the interaction of the
t'Hooft-Polyakov monopole with an external weak uniform magnetic field and the
field of another monopole.
