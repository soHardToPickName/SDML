On duality and reflection factors for the sinh-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  The sinh-Gordon model with integrable boundary conditions is considered in
low order perturbation theory. It is pointed out that results obtained by
Ghoshal for the sine-Gordon breather reflection factors suggest an interesting
dual relationship between models with different boundary conditions. Ghoshal's
formula for the lightest breather is checked perturbatively to $O(\beta^2)$ in
the special set of cases in which the $\phi\to -\phi$ symmetry is maintained.
It is noted that the parametrisation of the boundary potential which is natural
for the semi-classical approximation also provides a good parametrisation at
the `free-fermion' point.
