Coupling a Self-Dual Tensor to Gravity in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A recent result concerning interacting theories of self-dual tensor gauge
fields in six dimensions is generalized to include coupling to gravity. The
formalism makes five of the six general coordinate invariances manifest,
whereas the sixth one requires a non-trivial analysis. The result should be
helpful in formulating the world-volume action of the M theory five-brane.
