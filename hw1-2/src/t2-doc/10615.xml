Field Redefinitions in String Theory as a Solution Generating Technique
</title>

<abstract>
  The purpose of this work is to show that there exists an additional
invariance of the $\beta$-function equations of string theory on
$d+1$-dimensional targets with $d$ toroidal isometries. It corresponds to a
shift of the dilaton field and a scaling of the lapse function, and is
reminiscent of string field redefinitions. While it preserves the form of the
$\beta$-function equations, it changes the effective action and the solutions.
Thus it can be used as a solution generating technique. It is particularly
interesting to note that there are field redefinitions which map solutions with
non-zero string cosmological constant to those with zero cosmological constant.
Several simple examples involving two- and three-dimensional black holes and
black strings are provided to illustrate the role of such field redefinitions.
