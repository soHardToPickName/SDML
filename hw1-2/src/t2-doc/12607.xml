Ashtekar's Variables for Arbitrary Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  A generally covariant gauge theory for an arbitrary gauge group with
dimension $\geq 3$, that reduces to Ashtekar's canonical formulation of gravity
for SO(3,C), is presented. The canonical form of the theory is shown to contain
only first class constraints.
