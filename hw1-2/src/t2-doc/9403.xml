Introducing LambdaTensor1.0 - A package for explicit symbolic and
  numeric Lie algebra and Lie group calculations
</title>

<abstract>
  Due to the occurrence of large exceptional Lie groups in supergravity,
calculations involving explicit Lie algebra and Lie group element manipulations
easily become very complicated and hence also error-prone if done by hand.
Research on the extremal structure of maximal gauged supergravity theories in
various dimensions sparked the development of a library for efficient abstract
multilinear algebra calculations involving sparse and non-sparse higher-rank
tensors, which is presented here.
