Reducible representations of CAR and CCR with possible applications to
  field quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Reducible representations of CAR and CCR are applied to second quantization
of Dirac and Maxwell fields. The resulting field operators are indeed operators
and not operator-valued distributions. Examples show that the formalism may
lead to a finite quantum field theory.
