Gauge Theories in the Derivative Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge theories with and without matter are formulated in the derivative
expansion. Amplitudues are derived as a power series in the energy scales;
there are simplifications as compared with the usual loop expansion. The
incorporation and summation of Wilson loops is natural in this approach and
allows for a derivation of the confining potential as well as the masses of the
gauge invariant observables.
