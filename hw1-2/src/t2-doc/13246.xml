Born-Infeld black hole in the isolated horizon framework
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we probe the Born-Infeld (BI) black hole in the isolated horizon
framework. It turns out that the BI black hole is consistent with the heuristic
model for colored black holes proposed by Ashtekar et al [(2001)
Class.Quant.Grav. v. 18, 919-940]. The model points to the unstability of the
BI black hole.
