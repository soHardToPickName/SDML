Algebraic Linearization of Dynamics of Calogero Type for any Coxeter
  Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Calogero-Moser systems can be generalized for any root system (including the
non-crystallographic cases). The algebraic linearization of the generalized
Calogero-Moser systems and of their quadratic (resp. quartic) perturbations are
discussed.
