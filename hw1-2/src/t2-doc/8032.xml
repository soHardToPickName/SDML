Notes on Theories with 16 Supercharges
</title>

<abstract>
  We survey the various field theories with 16 real supercharges. The most
widely known theory in this class is the N=4 theory in four dimensions. The
moduli space of vacua of these theories are described and the physics at the
singularities of the moduli spaces are studied.
