Holographic Principle during Inflation and a Lower Bound on Density
  Fluctuations
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the holographic principle during the inflationary stage of our
universe. Where necessary, we illustrate the analysis in the case of new and
extended inflation which, together, typify generic models of inflation. We find
that in the models of extended inflation type, and perhaps of new inflation
type also, the holographic principle leads to a lower bound on the density
fluctuations.
