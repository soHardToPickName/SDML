$k^+=0$ Modes in Light-Cone Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the light-cone quantization of $\phi^3$ theory in 1+1
dimensions with a regularization of discretized light-cone momentum $k^+$.
Solving a second-class constraint associated with the $k^+=0$ mode, we show
that the $k^+=0$ mode propagates along the internal lines of Feynman diagrams
in any order of perturbation, hence our theory recovers the Lorentz invariance.
