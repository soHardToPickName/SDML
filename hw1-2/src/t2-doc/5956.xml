The Energy-Momentum Tensor in Noncommutative Gauge Field Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the different possibilities of constructing the various
energy-momentum tensors for noncommutative gauge field models. We use Jackiw's
method in order to get symmetric and gauge invariant stress tensors--at least
for commutative gauge field theories. The noncommutative counterparts are
analyzed with the same methods. The issues for the noncommutative cases are
worked out.
