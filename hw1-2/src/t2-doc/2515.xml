A Hierarchy of Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a hierarchy of supersymmetric string theories by showing that
the general N-extended superstrings may be viewed as a special class of the
(N+1)-extended superstrings. As a side result, we find a twisted (N+2)
superconformal algebra realized in the N-extended string.
