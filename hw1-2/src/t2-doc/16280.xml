Connection between Space-Time Supersymmetry and Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that $N=2$ and $N=4$ extended supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories in
four space-time dimensions could be derived as action functionals for
non-commutative spaces. The coupling of $N=1$ and $N=2$ super Yang-Mills to
$N=1$ and $N=2$ matter could be derived as action functionals of
non-commutative spaces only for a restricted class of models where a general
superpotential is not allowed.
