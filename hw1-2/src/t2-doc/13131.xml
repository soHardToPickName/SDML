The MFF Singular Vectors in Topological Conformal Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that singular vectors of the topological conformal (twisted
$N=2$) algebra are identical with singular vectors of the $sl(2)$ Kac--Moody
algebra. An arbitrary matter theory can be dressed by additional fields to make
up a representation of either the $sl(2)$ current algebra or the topological
conformal algebra. The relation between the two constructions is equivalent to
the Kazama--Suzuki realisation of a topological conformal theory as
$sl(2)\oplus u(1)/u(1)$. The Malikov--Feigin--Fuchs (MFF) formula for the
$sl(2)$ singular vectors translates into a general expression for topological
singular vectors. The MFF/topological singular states are observed to vanish in
Witten's free-field construction of the (twisted) $N=2$ algebra, derived from
the Landau--Ginzburg formalism.
