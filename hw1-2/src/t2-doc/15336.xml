  Theory of Feynman's Proof of the Maxwell Equations

<abstract>
  R.P. Feynman showed F.J. Dyson a proof of the Lorentz force law and the
homogeneous Maxwell equations, which he obtained starting from Newton's law of
motion and the commutation relations between position and velocity for a single
nonrelativistic particle. We formulate both a special relativistic and a
general relativistic versions of Feynman's derivation. Especially in the
general relativistic version we prove that the only possible fields that can
consistently act on a quantum mechanical particle are scalar, gauge and
gravitational fields. We also extend Feynman's scheme to the case of
non-Abelian gauge theory in the special relativistic context.
