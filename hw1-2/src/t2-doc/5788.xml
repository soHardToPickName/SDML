Casimir Effect, Hawking Radiation and Trace Anomaly

<abstract>
  The Casimir energy for massless scalar field of two parallel conductor, in
two dimensional Schwarzchild black hole background, with Dirichlet boundary
conditions is calculated by making use of general properties of renormalized
stress tensor. We show that vacuum expectation value of stress tensor can be
obtain by Casimir effect, trace anomaly and Hawking radiation. Four-dimensional
of this problem, by this method, is under progress by this author.
