D-brane gauge theories from toric singularities of the form $C^3/\Gamma$
  and $C^4/\Gamma$
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss examples of D-branes probing toric singularities, and the
computation of their world-volume gauge theories from the geometric data of the
singularities. We consider several such examples of D-branes on partial
resolutions of the orbifolds ${\bf C^3/Z_2\times Z_2}$,${\bf C^3/Z_2\times
Z_3}$ and ${\bf C^4/Z_2\times Z_2 \times Z_2}$.
