Two-Black-Hole Bound States
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum mechanics of $N$ slowly-moving BPS black holes in five dimensions
is considered. A divergent continuum of states describing arbitrarily closely
bound black holes with arbitrarily small excitation energies is found. A
superconformal structure appears at low energies and can be used to define an
index counting the weighted number of supersymmetric bound states. It is shown
that the index is determined from the dimensions of certain cohomology classes
on the symmetric product of $N$ copies of $R^4$. An explicit computation for
the case of N=2 with no angular momentum yields a finite nonzero result.
