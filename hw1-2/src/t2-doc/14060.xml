Facts of life with gamma(5)
</title>

<abstract>
  The increasing precision of many experiments in elementary particle physics
leads to continuing interest in perturbative higher order calculations in the
electroweak Standard Model or extensions of it. Such calculations are of
increasing complexity because more loops and/or more legs are considered.
Correspondingly efficient computational methods are mandatory for many
calculations. One problem which affects the feasibility of higher order
calculations is the problem with gamma(5) in dimensional regularization. Since
the subject thirty years after its invention is still controversial I advocate
here some ideas which seem not to be common knowledge but might shed some new
light on the problem. I present arguments in favor of utilizing an
anticommuting gamma(5) and a simple 4-dimensional treatment of the hard
anomalies.
