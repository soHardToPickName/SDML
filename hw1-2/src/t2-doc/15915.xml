Conformal Invariance and Wave-Particle Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a conformally invariant generalized form of the free particle
action by connecting the wave and particle aspects through gravity. Conformal
invariance breaking is introduced by choosing a particular configurat$ of
dynamical variables. This leads to the geometrization of the quantum aspects of
matter.
