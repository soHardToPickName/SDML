Some Correlators of $SU(3)_3$ WZW Models on Higher-Genus Riemann
  Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the conformal embedding on the torus, we can express some characters of
$SU(3)_3$ in terms of $SO(8)_1$ characters. Then with the help of crossing
symmetry, modular transformation and factorization properties of Green
functions, we will calculate a class of correlators of $SU(3)_3$ on arbitrary
Riemann surfaces. This method can apply to all $k>1$ WZW models which can be
conformally embedded in some $k=1$ WZW models.
