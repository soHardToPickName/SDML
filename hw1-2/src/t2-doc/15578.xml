Extremal black holes as exact string solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the leading order solution describing an extremal electrically
charged black hole in string theory is, in fact, an exact solution to all
orders in $\a'$ when interpreted in a Kaluza-Klein fashion. This follows from
the observation that it can be obtained via dimensional reduction from a five
dimensional background which is proved to be an exact string solution.
