Event Symmetric Open String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Field Theory on Event Symmetric space-time is constructed using the gauge
group of discrete open strings. Models with invariant actions can be viewed as
natural extensions of Matrix Models. The objective is to find a fundamental
non-perturbative pre-theory for superstrings.
