Strings in AdS_3 and the SL(2,R) WZW Model. Part 1: The Spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the spectrum of bosonic string theory on AdS_3. We
study classical solutions of the SL(2,R) WZW model, including solutions for
long strings with non-zero winding number. We show that the model has a
symmetry relating string configurations with different winding numbers. We then
study the Hilbert space of the WZW model, including all states related by the
above symmetry. This leads to a precise description of long strings. We prove a
no-ghost theorem for all the representations that are involved and discuss the
scattering of the long string.
