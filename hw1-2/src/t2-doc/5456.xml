Generalized Coordinate Gauge, Nonabelian Stokes Theorem and Dual QCD
  Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper is an extended version of hep-th/9802134. Dual QCD Lagrangian is
derived by making use of the generalized coordinate gauge, where 1-form (vector
potential) is expressed as an integral of the 2-form (field strength) along an
(arbitrary) contour. As another application a simple proof of the nonabelian
Stokes theorem is given.
