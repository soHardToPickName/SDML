A Note on Noncommutative Chern-Simons Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The three dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\rr^2_{\theta}\times \rr$ is
studied. Considering the gauge transformations under the group elements which
are going to one at infinity, we show that under arbitrary (finite) gauge
transformations action changes with an integer multiple of $2\pi$ {\it if}, the
level of noncommutaitive Chern-Simons is {\it quantized}. We also briefly
discuss the case of the noncommutaitve torus and some other possible
extensions.
