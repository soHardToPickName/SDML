Quarks in the Skyrme-'t Hooft-Witten Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The three-flavor Skyrme-'t Hooft-Witten model is interpreted in terms of a
quark-like substructure, leading to a new model of explicitly confined
color-free ``quarks'' reminiscent of Gell-Mann's original pre-color quarks, but
with unexpected and significant differences.
