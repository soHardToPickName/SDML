Duality and asymptotic geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a series of duality transformations that leads to a constant
shift in the harmonic functions appearing in the description of a configuration
of branes. This way, for several intersections of branes, we can relate the
original brane configuration which is asymptotically flat to a geometry of the
type $adS_k \xx E^l \xx S^m$. The implications of our results for supersymmetry
enhancement, M(atrix) theory at finite N, and for supergravity theories in
diverse dimensions are discussed.
