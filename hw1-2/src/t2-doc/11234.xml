Noncommutative Field Theories and Smooth Commutative Limits
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two model field theories on a noncommutative plane that have
smooth commutative limits. One is the single-component fermion theory with
quartic interaction that vanishes identically in the commutative limit. The
other is a scalar-fermion theory, which extends the scalar field theory with
quartic interaction by adding a fermion. We compute the bound state energies
and the two particle scattering amplitudes exactly.
