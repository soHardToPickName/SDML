$W_n^{(\ka)}$ algebra associated with the Moyal KdV Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Gelfand-Dickey (GD) structure defined by the Moyal
$\star$-product with parameter $\ka$, which not only defines the bi-Hamiltonian
structure for the generalized Moyal KdV hierarchy but also provides a
$W_n^{(\ka)}$ algebra containing the Virasoro algebra as a subalgebra with
central charge $\ka^2(n^3-n)/3$.
 The free-field realization of the $W_n^{(\ka)}$ algebra is given through the
Miura transformation and the cases for $W_3^{(\ka)}$ and $W_4^{(\ka)}$ are
worked out in detail.
