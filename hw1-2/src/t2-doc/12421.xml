Black Holes with Multiple Charges and the Correspondence Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the entropy of near extremal black holes with multiple charges in
the context of the recently proposed correspondence principle of Horowitz and
Polchinski, including black holes with two, three and four Ramond-Ramond
charges. We find that at the matching point the black hole entropy can be
accounted for by massless open strings ending on the D-branes for all cases
except a black hole with four Ramond-Ramond charges, in which case a possible
resolution in terms of brane-antibrane excitations is considered.
