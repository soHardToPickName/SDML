Electric-Magnetic duality and the "Loop Representation" in Abelian Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Abelian Gauge Theories are quantized in a geometric representation that
generalizes the Loop Representation and treates electric and magnetic operators
on the same footing. The usual canonical algebra is turned into a topological
algebra of non local operators that resembles the order-disorder dual algebra
of 't Hooft. These dual operators provide a complete description of the
physical phase space of the theories.
