Conformality and Unification of Gauge Couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  By use of the AdS/CFT correspondence on orbifolds, models are derived which
can contain the standard model of particle phenomenology. It will be assumed
that the theory becomes conformally invariant at a renormalization-group
fixed-point in the TeV region. A recent application to TeV unification is
briefly mentioned.
