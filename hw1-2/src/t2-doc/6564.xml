Duality in 2D Spin Models on Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  Method of derivation of the duality relations for two-dimensional
Z(N)-symmetric spin models on finite square lattice wrapped on the torus is
proposed. As example, exact duality relations for the nonhomogeneous Ising
model (N=2) and the Z(N)-Berezinsky-Villain model are obtained.
