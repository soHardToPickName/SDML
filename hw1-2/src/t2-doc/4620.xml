Dilaton Black Holes with Electric Charge
</title>

<abstract>
  Static spherically symmetric solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell gravity with
the dilaton field are described. The solutions correspond to black holes and
are generalizations of the previously known dilaton black hole solution. In
addition to mass and electric charge these solutions are labeled by a new
parameter, the dilaton charge of the black hole. Different effects of the
dilaton charge on the geometry of space-time of such black holes are studied.
It is shown that in most cases the scalar curvature is divergent at the
horizons. Another feature of the dilaton black hole is that there is a finite
interval of values of electric charge for which no black hole can exist.
