Exchange Relations for the q-Vertex Operators of $U_q(\widehat{sl2})$
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the q-deformed Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for the two point
function of q-deformed vertex operators of $U_q(sl_2^)$. We give explicitly the
fundamental solutions, the connection matrices and the exchange relations for
the q-vertex operators of spin 1/2 and $j \in {1\over 2}{\bf Z}_{\geq 0}$.
Consequently, we confirm that the connection matrices are equivalent to the
elliptic Boltzman weights of IRF type obtained by the fusion procedure from ABF
models.
