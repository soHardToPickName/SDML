Perturbative Computation of Glueball Superpotentials for SO(N) and
  USp(N)
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the superspace method of hep-th/0211017 to prove the matrix model
conjecture for N=1 USp(N) and SO(N) gauge theories in four dimensions. We
derive the prescription to relate the matrix model to the field theory
computations. We perform an explicit calculation of glueball superpotentials.
The result is consistent with field theory expectations.
