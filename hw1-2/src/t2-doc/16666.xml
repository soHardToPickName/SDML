Relation between Worldline Green Functions for Scalar Two-Loop Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a relation between two-loop bosonic worldline Green functions
which are obtained by Schmidt and Schubert in two different parametrizations of
a two-loop worldline. These Green functions are transformed into each other by
some transformation rules based on reparametrizations of the proper time and
worldline modular parameters.
