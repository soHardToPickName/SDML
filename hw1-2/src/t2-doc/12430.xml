Non-critical superstrings: a comparison between continuum and discrete
  approaches
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the relation between the matrix model and Liouville approaches to
two-dimensional gravity as elaborated by Moore, Seiberg and Staudacher. Then,
based on the supersymmetric Liouville formulation and the discrete eigenvalue
model proposed by Alvarez-Gaum\'e, Itoyama, Ma\~nes and Zadra, we extend the
previous relation to the supersymmetric case. The minisuperspace approximation
for the supersymmetric case is formulated, and the corresponding wave equation
is found.
