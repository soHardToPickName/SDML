Magnetic charge, angular momentum and negative cosmological constant

<abstract>
  We argue that there are no axially symmetric rotating monopole solutions for
a Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in flat spacetime background. We construct axially
symmetric Yang-Mills-Higgs solutions in the presence of a negative cosmological
constant, carrying magnetic charge $n$ and a nonvanishing electric charge.
However, these solution are also nonrotating.
