Who Confines Quarks? - On Non-Abelian Monopoles and Dynamics of
  Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  The role non-Abelian magnetic monopoles play in the dynamics of confinement
is discussed by examining carefully a class of supersymmetric gauge theories as
theoretical laboratories. In particular, in the so-called $r$-vacua of softly
broken ${N}=2$ supersymmmetric $SU(n_c)$ QCD, the Goddard-Olive-Nuyts-Weinberg
monopoles appear as the dominant low-energy effective degrees of freedom. Even
more interesting is the physics of confining vacua which are deformations of
nontrivial superconformal theories. We argue that in such cases, occurring in
the $r= {n_f \over 2}$ vacua of $SU(n_c)$ theories or in all of confining vacua
of $USp(2n_c)$ or $SO(n_f)$ theories with massless flavors, a new mechanism of
confinement involving strongly interacting non-Abelian magnetic monopoles is at
work.
