On Domain-Wall/QFT Dualities in Various Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate domain-wall/quantum field theory correspondences in various
dimensions. Our general analysis does not only cover the well-studied cases in
ten and eleven dimensions but also enables us to discuss new cases like a Type
I/Heterotic 6-brane in ten dimensions and domain wall dualities in lower than
ten dimensions. The examples we discuss include `d-branes' in six dimensions
preserving 8 supersymmetries and extreme black holes in various dimensions. In
the latter case we construct the quantum mechanics Hamiltonian and discuss
several limits.
