ADM Worldvolume Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the dynamics of a relativistic extended object in terms of the
geometry of a configuration of constant time. This involves an adaptation of
the ADM formulation of canonical general relativity. We apply the formalism to
the hamiltonian formulation of a Dirac-Nambu-Goto relativistic extended object
in an arbitrary background spacetime.
