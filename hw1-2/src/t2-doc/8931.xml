Exactly Solvable Models in Arbitrary Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a new class of quasi-exactly solvable many-body Hamiltonians in
arbitrary dimensions, whose ground states can have any correlations we choose.
Some of the known correlations in one dimension and some recent novel
correlations in two and higher dimensions are reproduced as special cases. As
specific interesting examples, we also write down some new models in two and
higher dimensions with novel correlations.
