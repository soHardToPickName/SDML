Gauge transformations of the non-Abelian two-form
</title>

<abstract>
  A novel inhomogeneous gauge transformation law is proposed for a non-Abelian
adjoint two-form in four dimensions. Rules for constructing actions invariant
under this are given. The auxiliary vector field which appears in some of these
models transforms like a second connection in the theory. Another local
symmetry leaves the compensated three-form field strength invariant, but does
not seem to be generated by any combination of local constraints. Both types of
symmetries change the action by total divergences, suggesting that boundary
degrees of freedom have to be taken into account for local quantization.
