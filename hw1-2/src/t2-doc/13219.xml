Constrained current algebras and $g/u(1)^d$ conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Operator quantization of the WZNW theory invariant with respect to an affine
Kac-Moody algebra $\hat g$ with constrained $\hat {u}(1)^d$ currents is
performed using Dirac's procedure. Upon quantization the initial
energy-momentum tensor is replaced by the $g/u(1)^d$ coset construction. The
$\hat {su}(2)$ WZNW  theory with a constrained $\hat u(1)$ current is
equivalent to the $su(2)/u(1)$ conformal field theory.
