On dimensional reductions of the M-9-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relations of the M-9-brane with other branes via dimensional
reductions, mainly focusing on their Wess-Zumino (WZ) actions. It is shown that
on three kinds of dimensional reductions, the WZ action of the M-9-brane
respectively gives those of the D-8-brane, the ``KK-8A brane'' (which we regard
as a kind of D-8-brane) and the ``NS-9A brane'', the last two actions of which
were obtained via dualities. Based on these results, we conclude that the
relation of p-branes for $p\ge 8$, proposed previously, is consistent from the
viewpoint of worldvolume actions.
