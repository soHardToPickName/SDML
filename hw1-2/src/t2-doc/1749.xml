Cosmic Rotation Axis, Birefrigence and Axions to detect Primordial
  torsion fields
</title>

  Nodland Ralston (PRL,1997) investigated the cosmological anisotropy of
electromagnetic fields.In this paper we show that it is possible obtain a
torsion correction to Nodland-Ralston action starting from the massive Proca
electrodynamics in Riemannian spacetime and performing the minimal coupling
with torsion.We end up with an action which contains the Nodland Ralston action
without breaking the gauge invariance.This mechanism however gives a photon a
mass generated by the nonlinear torsion terms.The torsion vector is along the
cosmic rotation axis and interacts with the massive photon.This method which
breaks conformal invariance allow us to determine a primordial torsion of the
order $10^{-29}eV$ from the well-known photon mass limits.
