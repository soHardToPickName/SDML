Perturbation Theory for Antisymmetric Tensor Fields in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Perturbation theory for a class of topological field theories containing
antisymmetric tensor fields is considered. These models are characterized by a
supersymmetric structure which allows to establish their perturbative
finiteness.
