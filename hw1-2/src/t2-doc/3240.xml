Finite Field Theory on Noncommutative Geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  The propagator is calculated on a noncommutative version of the flat plane
and the Lobachevsky plane with and without an extra (euclidean) time parameter.
In agreement with the general idea of noncommutative geometry it is found that
the limit when the two `points' coincide is finite and diverges only when the
geometry becomes commutative. The flat 4-dimensional case is also considered.
This is at the moment less interesting since there has been no curved case
developed with which it can be compared.
