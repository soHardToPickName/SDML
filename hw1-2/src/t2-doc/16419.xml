High Momentum Behavior of Geometric Bremsstrahlung in the Expanding
  Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We shall discuss various kinds of geometric bremsstrahlung processes in the
spatially flat Robertson-Walker universe. Despite that the temperature of the
universe is much higher than particle masses and the Hubble parameter, the
transition probability of these processes do not vanish. It is also pointed out
that explicit forms of the probability possess a new duality with respect to
scale factor of background geometry.
