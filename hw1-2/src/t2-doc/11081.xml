The dual of nothing
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider ``bubbles of nothing'' constructed by analytically continuing
black hole solutions in Anti-de Sitter space. These provide interesting
examples of smooth time-dependent backgrounds which can be studied through the
AdS/CFT correspondence. Our examples include bubbles constructed from
Schwarzschild-AdS, Kerr-AdS and Reissner-Nordstrom AdS. The Schwarzschild
bubble is dual to Yang-Mills theory on three dimensional de Sitter space times
a circle. We construct the boundary stress tensor of the bubble spacetime and
relate it to the properties of field theory on de Sitter.
