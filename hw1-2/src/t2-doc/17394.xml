A New Current Regularization of Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an ambiguity of the current regularization in the Thirring model. We
find a new current definition which enables to make a comprehensive treatment
of the current. Our formulation is simpler than Klaiber's formulation. We
compare our result with other formulations and find a very good agreement with
their result. We also obtain the Schwinger term and the general formula for any
current regularization.
