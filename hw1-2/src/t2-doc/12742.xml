Vaccum Polarization for a Massless Scalar Field in the Global Monopole
  Spacetime at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we calculate the effects produced by temperature in the
renormalized vaccum expectation value of the square of the massless scalar
field in the pointlike global monopole spacetime. In order to develop this
calculation, we had to construct the Euclidean thermal Green function
associated with this field in this background. We also calculate the
high-temperature limit for the thermal average of the zero-zero component of
the energy-momentum tensor.
