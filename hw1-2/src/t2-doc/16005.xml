Triplication of SU(5) monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate all spherically symmetric fundamental monopole solutions with
fixed topological charge in the SU(5) --> SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1)/Z_3xZ_2 symmetry
breaking. We find that there is three-fold replication of the monopoles. The
three copies correspond to bound states with ``monopole clouds'' arising from
the non-Abelian nature of the SU(3) factor. The triplication of monopoles could
help us understand the observed family structure of standard model particles.
