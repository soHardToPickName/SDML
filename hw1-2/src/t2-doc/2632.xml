Quantization of U_q[so(2n+1)] with deformed para-Fermi operators
</title>

<abstract>
  The observation that n pairs of para-Fermi (pF) operators generate the
universal enveloping algebra of the orthogonal Lie algebra so(2n+1) is used in
order to define deformed pF operators. It is shown that these operators are an
alternative to the Chevalley generators. On this background Uq[so(2n+1)] and
its "Cartan-Weyl" generators are written down entirely in terms of deformed pB
operators.
