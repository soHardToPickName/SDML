Unitarity, Analytical Time and Hawking's Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  By analytically continuing the time variable in a black hole background, and
requiring unitary evolution, it is found that quantum mechanical states at the
horizon develop a thermal factor under suitable identification of the physical
time. The thermal factor is found to be determined exactly by the Hawking's
temperature. This can be interpreted as the Hawking's radiation and offers an
alternative understanding to the process and the information loss puzzle.
