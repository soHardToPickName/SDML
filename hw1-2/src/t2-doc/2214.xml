Non-Abelian Gauge Configuration with a Magnetic Field Concentrated at a
  Point
</title>

<abstract>
  A specific SU(2) gauge configuration yielding a magnetic field concentrated
at a point is investigated. Its relation to the Aharonov-Bohm gauge potential
and its cohomological meaning in a three dimensional space are clarified.
Quantum mechanics of a spinning particle in such a gauge configuration is
briefly discussed.
