Self-dual Tensors in Six-Dimensional Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some properties of the field equations of six-dimensional (1,0)
supergravity coupled to tensor and vector multiplets, and in particular their
relation to covariant and consistent anomalies and a peculiar Noether identity
for the energy-momentum tensor. We also describe a lagrangian formulation for
this system, obtained applying the Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin prescription.
