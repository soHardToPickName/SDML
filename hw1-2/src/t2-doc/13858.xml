Generalized Runge-Lenz Vector in Taub-Nut Spinning Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalized Killing equations and the symmetries of Taub-NUT spinning
space are investigated. For spinless particles the Runge-Lenz vector defines a
constant of motion directly, whereas for spinning particles it now requires a
non-trivial contribution from spin. The generalized Runge-Lenz vector for
spinning Taub-NUT space is completely evaluated.
