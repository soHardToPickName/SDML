Syncyclons or Solitonic Signals from Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In theories where spacetime is a direct product of Minkowski space ($M^4$)
and a d dimensional compact space ($K^d$), there can exist topological solitons
that simultaneously wind around $R^3$ (or $R^2$ or $R^1$) in $M^4$ and the
compact dimensions. A paradigmatic non-gravitational example of such
``co-winding" solitons is furnished by Yang-Mills theory defined on $M^4 X
S^1$. Pointlike, stringlike and sheetlike solitons can be identified by
transcribing and generalizing the proceedure used to construct the periodic
instanton (caloron) solutions. Asymptotically the classical pointlike objects
have non-Abelian magnetic dipole fields together with a non-Abelian scalar
potential while the ``color" electric charge is zero. However quantization of
collective coordinates associated with zeromodes and coupling to fermions can
radically change these quantum numbers due to fermion number fractionalization
and its non-Abelian generalization. Interpreting the YM group as color (or the
Electroweak SU(2) group) and assuming that an extra circular dimension exists
thus implies the existence of topologically stable solitonic objects which
carry baryon(lepton) number and a mass O($1/g^2R$), where R is the radius of
the compact dimension.
