WZNW Models from Non-Standard Bilinear Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the WZNW models based on nonstandard bilinear forms. We approach the
problem from algebraic, perturbative and functional exact methods. It is shown
that even in the case of integer $k$ we can find irrational CFT's. We prove
that when the base group is noncompact with nonabelian maximal compact
subgroup, the Kac-Moody representations are nonunitary.
