Duality in Sp and SO Gauge Groups from M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe fivebrane configurations in M theory whose 4-d spacetime contains
N=1 supersymmetric Sp or SO gauge fields and fundamentals of these groups. We
show how field-theory dualities for Sp and SO groups can be derived using these
fivebrane configurations in M theory.
