On Conformal Properties of the Dualized Sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We have calculated the first-order beta-functions for a sigma-model ( with
dilaton) dualized with respect to an arbitrary Lie group that acts without
isotropy. We find that non-abelian duality preserves conformal invariance for
semi-simple groups, but in general there is an extra contribution to the
beta-function proportional to the trace of the structure constants, which
cannot be absorbed into an additional dilaton shift. Two particular examples, a
Bianchi V cosmological background and the G \otimes G WZW model, are discussed.
