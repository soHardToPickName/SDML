Non-local Thirring model at finite-temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend a recently proposed non-local and non-covariant version of the
Thirring model to the finite-temperature case. We obtain a completely bosonized
expression for the partition function, describing the thermodynamics of the
collective modes which are the underlying excitations of this system. From this
result we derive closed formulae for the free-energy, specific-heat, two-point
correlation functions and momentum distribution, as functionals of
electron-electron coupling potentials.
