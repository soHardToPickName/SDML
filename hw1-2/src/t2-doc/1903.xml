Supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  The connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the Korteweg- de
Vries (KdV) equation is discussed, with particular emphasis on the KdV
conservation laws. It is shown that supersymmetric quantum mechanics aids in
the derivation of the conservation laws, and gives some insight into the Miura
transformation that converts the KdV equation into the modified KdV equation.
The construction of the $\tau$-function by means of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics is discussed.
