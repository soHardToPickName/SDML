On quantization of singular varieties and applications to D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the ring of differential operators on some singular affine
varieties (intersecting stacks, a point on a singular curve or an orbifold).
Our results support the proposed connection of the ring of differential
operators with geometry of D-branes in (bosonic) string theory. In particular,
the answer does know about the resolution of singularities in accordance with
the string theory predictions.
