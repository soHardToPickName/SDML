Hamiltonian Formulation of the Smooth Bosonization and Local Gauge
  Symmetry of the Massless Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the hamiltonian formalism, we investigate the smooth bosonization
method in which bosonization and fermionization are carried out through a
specific gauge-fixing of an enlarged gauge invariant theory. The generator of
the local gauge symmetry, which cannot be derived from the lagrangian of the
enlarged theory, is obtained by making a canonical transformation. We also show
that the massless Thirring model possesses a similar local gauge symmetry for a
speific value of the coupling constant.
