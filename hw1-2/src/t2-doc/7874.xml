Minimal subtraction and the Callan-Symanzik equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The usual proof of renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation makes
explicit use of normalization conditions. It is shown that demanding that the
renormalization group functions take the form required for minimal subtraction
allows one to prove renormalizability using the Callan-Symanzik equation,
without imposing normalization conditions. Scalar field theory and quantum
electrodynamics are treated.
