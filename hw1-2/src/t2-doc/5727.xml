Scalar gravitational waves and Einstein frame
</title>

<abstract>
  The response of a gravitational wave detector to scalar waves is analysed in
the framework of the debate on the choice of conformal frames for scalar-tensor
theories. A correction to the geodesic equation arising in the Einstein
conformal frame modifies the geodesic deviation equation. This modification is
due to the non-metricity of the theory in the Einstein frame, yielding a
longitudinal mode that is absent in the Jordan conformal frame.
