Stabilised Matrix Models for Non-Perturbative Two Dimensional Quantum
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A thorough analysis of stochastically stabilised hermitian one matrix models
for two dimensional quantum gravity at all its $(2,2k-1)$ multicritical points
is made. It is stressed that only the zero fermion sector of the supersymmetric
hamiltonian, i.e., the forward Fokker-Planck hamiltonian, is relevant for the
analysis of bosonic matter coupled to two dimensional gravity. Therefore,
supersymmetry breaking is not the physical mechanism that creates non
perturbative effects in the case of points of even multicriticality $k$. Non
perturbative effects in the string coupling constant $g_{str}$ result in a loss
of any explicit relation to the KdV hierarchy equations in the latter case,
while maintaining the perturbative genus expansion. As a by-product of our
analysis it is explicitly proved that polynomials orthogonal relative to an
arbitrary weight $\exp (-\beta V(x))$ along the whole real line obey an
Hartree-Fock equation.
