Heterotic Yukawa couplings and continuous Wilson lines
</title>

<abstract>
  Realistic heterotic string models require the presence of the Wilson lines.
We study the effect of continuous Wilson lines on the heterotic Yukawa
couplings and find that the presence of continuous Wilson lines affects the
magnitude of the twisted Yukawa couplings resulting in their stronger
hierarchy.
