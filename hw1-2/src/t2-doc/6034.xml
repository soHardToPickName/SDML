Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin Actions in the Presence of Sources
</title>

<abstract>
  Pasti, Sorokin and Tonin have recently constructed manifestly
Lorentz-invariant actions for self-dual field strengths and for Maxwell fields
with manifest electromagnetic duality. Using the method of Deser, Gomberoff,
Henneaux and Teitelboim, we generalize these actions in the presence of
sources.
