Spontaneous Magnetization in Lorentz Invariant Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In a class of three-dimensional Abelian gauge theories with both light and
heavy fermions, heavy chiral fermions can trigger dynamical generation of a
magnetic field, leading to the spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz invaiance.
Finite masses of light fermions tend to restore the Lorentz invariance.
