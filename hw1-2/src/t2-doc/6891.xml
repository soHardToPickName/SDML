Background gauge invariance in the antifield formalism for theories with
  open gauge algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that any BRST invariant quantum action with open or closed gauge
algebra has a corresponding local background gauge invariance. If the BRST
symmetry is anomalous, but the anomaly can be removed in the antifield
formalism, then the effective action possesses a local background gauge
invariance. The presence of antifields (BRST sources) is necessary. As an
example we analyze chiral $W_3$ gravity.
