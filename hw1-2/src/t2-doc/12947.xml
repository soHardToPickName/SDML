Ambiguities of the Seiberg-Witten map in the presence of matter field
</title>

<abstract>
  The ambiguities of the Seiberg-Witten map for gauge field coupled with
fermionic matter are discussed. We find that only part of the ambiguities can
be absorbed by gauge transformation and/or field redefinition and thus are
negligible. The existence of matter field makes some other part of the
ambiguities difficult to be absorbed by gauge transformation or field
redefinition.
