Particle number in kinetic theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a derivation for the particle number densities on phase space for
scalar and fermionic fields in terms of Wigner functions. Our expressions
satisfy the desired properties: for bosons the particle number is positive, for
fermions it lies in the interval between zero and one, and both are consistent
with thermal field theory. As applications we consider the Bunch-Davies vacuum
and fermionic preheating after inflation.
