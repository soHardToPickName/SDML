New Topological Aspects of $BF$ Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  $BF$ theories defined over non trivial line bundles are studied. It is shown
that such theories describe a realization of a non trivial higher order bundle.
The partition function differs from the usual one -in terms of the Ray Singer
Torsion- by a factor that arises from the non triviality of the line bundles.
