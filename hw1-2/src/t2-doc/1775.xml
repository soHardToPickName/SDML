Supersymmetric Model with Grassmann-odd Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  A supersymmetric $D = 1, N =1$ model with a Grassmann-odd Lagrangian is
proposed which, in contrast to the model with an even Lagrangian, contains not
only a kinetic term but also an interaction term for the coordinates entering
into one real scalar Grassmann-even (bosonic) superfield.
