Field theory models for variable cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Anthropic solutions to the cosmological constant problem require seemingly
unnatural scalar field potentials with a very small slope or domain walls
(branes) with a very small coupling to a four-form field. Here we introduce a
class of models in which the smallness of the corresponding parameters can be
attributed to a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry. We also demonstrate the
equivalence of scalar field and four-form models. Finally, we show how our
models can be naturally embedded into a left-right extension of the standard
model.
