Lagrangian Models of the Particles with Spin: The First Seventy Years
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review models of relativistic particles with spin. Departing
from the oldest attempts to describe the spin within the lagrangian framework
we pass through various non supersymmetric models. Then the component and
superfield formulations of the spinning particle and superparticle models are
reviewed. Our focus is mainly on the classical side of the problem, but some
quantization questions are mentioned as well.
