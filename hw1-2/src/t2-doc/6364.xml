Nahm gauge fields for the torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the exact expression for the Nahm gauge field associated to a
SU(N) charge one self-dual gauge field on T^3XR. The result implies that the
size of the instanton is determined by the ``distance'' between its two flat
connections at t plus or minus infinty.
