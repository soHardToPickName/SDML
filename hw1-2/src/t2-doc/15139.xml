An Alternative Dimensional Reduction Prescription
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an alternative dimensional reduction prescription which in respect
with Green functions corresponds to drop the extra spatial coordinate. From
this, we construct the dimensionally reduced Lagrangians both for scalars and
fermions, discussing bosonization and supersymmetry in the particular
2-dimensional case. We argue that our proposal is in some situations more
physical, in the sense that it mantains the form of the interactions between
particles, thus preserving the dynamics corresponding to the higher dimensional
space.
