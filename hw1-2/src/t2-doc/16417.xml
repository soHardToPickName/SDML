New N=2 Supergravity with local Poincare invariance in nine dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Here it is shown that in nine dimensions, the super-Poincare group with a
U(1) central extension admits a fifth-rank invariant tensor. This allows the
construction of a new nine-dimensional supergravity theory whose field content,
apart from the vielbein, the spin connection and a complex gravitino, includes
an Abelian one-form. All the fields are assumed to belong to a single
connection for the gauge group. The gravitational sector is described by the
dimensional continuation of the Euler-Gauss-Bonnet density from eight to nine
dimensions, and the full supersymmetric Lagrangian can be written as a
Chern-Simons form. The supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell without auxiliary
fields. It is also proved that this kind of theories exists in three, five and
nine dimensions only.
