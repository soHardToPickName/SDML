Maximally supersymmetric solutions of ten- and eleven-dimensional
  supergravities

  We classify (up to local isometry) the maximally supersymmetric solutions of
the eleven- and ten-dimensional supergravity theories. We find that the AdS
solutions, the Hpp-waves and the flat space solutions exhaust them.
