Notes on D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a series of remedial lectures on open and unoriented strings for the
heterotic string generation. The particular focus is on the interesting
features that arise under T-duality---D-branes and orientifolds. The final
lecture discusses the application to string duality. There will be no puns.
Lectures presented by J. P. at the ITP from Nov. 16 to Dec. 5, 1995. References
updated through Jan. 25, 1996.
