String Nature of Confinement in (Non-)Abelian Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent progress achieved in the solution of the problem of confinement in
various (non-)Abelian gauge theories by virtue of a derivation of their string
representation is reviewed. The theories under study include QCD within the
so-called Method of Field Correlators, QCD-inspired Abelian-projected theories,
and compact QED in three and four space-time dimensions. Various
nonperturbative properties of the vacua of the above mentioned theories are
discussed. The relevance of the Method of Field Correlators to the study of
confinement in Abelian models, allowing for an analytical description of this
phenomenon, is illustrated by an evaluation of field correlators in these
models.
