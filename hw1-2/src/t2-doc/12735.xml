Rolling Tachyons in String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the role of rolling tachyons in the cosmological model with
dilatonic gravity. In the string frame, flat space solutions of both
initial-stage and late-time are obtained in closed form. In the Einstein frame,
we show that every expanding solution is decelerating.
