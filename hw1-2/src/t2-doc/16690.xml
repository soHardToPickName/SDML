A Cohomological Approach to the Non-Abelian Seiberg-Witten Map
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a cohomological method for obtaining the non-Abelian
Seiberg-Witten map for any gauge group and to any order in theta. By
introducing a ghost field, we are able to express the equations defining the
Seiberg-Witten map through a coboundary operator, so that they can be solved by
constructing a corresponding homotopy operator.
