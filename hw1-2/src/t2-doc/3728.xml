Positive Mass Theorem for Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell Axion-dilaton
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We presented the proof of the positive mass theorem for black holes in
Einstein-Maxwell axion-dilaton gravity being the low-energy limit of the
heterotic string theory. We show that the total mass of a spacetime containing
a black hole is greater or equal to the square root of the sum of squares of
the adequate dilaton-electric and dilaton-axion charges.
