Mass Generation and Instabilities in the Presence of External Fields and
  Axions
</title>

<abstract>
  Small fluctuations around a constant electric or constant magnetic field are
analyzed in a theory with pseudo scalar [phi] with a coupling
[g.phi.F.(F.dual)]. It is found that the magnetic external field leads to mass
generation for the small perturbations, while the electric field suffers from a
tachyonic instability in the case in which the field strength is higher than a
critical value (related to the pseudo scalar mass). The vacuum energy can be
exactly evaluated and it is found that an imaginary part is present when the
external electric field exceeds its critical value.
