Breaking SUSY on the Horizon
</title>

<abstract>
  I present a heuristic calculation of the critical exponent relating the
gravitino mass to the cosmological constant in a de Sitter universe. The
ingredients for the calculation are the area law for entropy, an R symmetry of
the low energy effective Lagrangian, and a crude picture of the degenerate
levels of the cosmological horizon.
