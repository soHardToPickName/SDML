Rotational Perturbations in Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  First order rotational perturbations of the flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) metric are considered in the framework of four dimensional
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) string cosmological models coupled with
dilaton and axion fields. The decay rate of rotation depends mainly upon the
dilaton field potential U. The equation for rotation imposes strong limitations
upon the functional form of U, restricting the allowed potentials to two: the
trivial case U=0 and a generalized exponential type potential. In these two
models the metric rotation function can be obtained in an exact analytic form
in both Einstein and string frames. In the potential-free case the decay of
rotational perturbations is governed by an arbitrary function of time while in
the presence of a potential the rotation tends rapidly to zero in both Einstein
and string frames.
