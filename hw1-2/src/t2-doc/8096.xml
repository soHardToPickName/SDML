Comment on Path Integral Derivation of Schr\"odinger Equation in Spaces
  with Curvature and Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a derivation of the Schr\"odinger equation for a path integral of
a point particle in a space with curvature and torsion which is considerably
shorter and more elegant than what is commonly found in the literature.
