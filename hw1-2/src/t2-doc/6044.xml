Some Simpler Analogues of the Dual Standard Model and their Relation to
  Bais' Generalisation of the Montenon-Olive Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the correspondence between SU(5) monopoles and the elementary
particles, which underlies the construction of a dual standard model, has some
simpler analogues associated with the strong, weak and hypercharge
interactions. We then discuss how these analogues relate to Bais'
generalization of the Montenon-Olive conjecture and find the representations of
the monopoles under the dual gauge group; these representations agree with
those of the elementary particles.
