Classification of c=2 Rational Conformal Field Theories via the Gauss
  Product
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a classification of $c=2$ rational conformal field theories arising
from a string compactification on $T^2$ in terms of Gauss' theory of binary
quadratic forms. As a byproduct, we find an identity which counts the
cardinality of a certain double coset space defined for isometries between the
discriminant forms of rank two lattices.
