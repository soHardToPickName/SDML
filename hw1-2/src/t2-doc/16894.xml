Non-commutative Soliton Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  We study solitons in three dimensional non-commutative scalar field theory at
infinite non-commutativity parameter. We find the metric on the relative moduli
space of all solitons of the form |n><n| and show that it is Kahler. We then
find the geodesics of this metric and study the scattering of these solitons.
In particular we find that the scattering is generally right angle for small
values of the impact parameter. We can understand this behaviour in terms of a
conical singularity at the origin of moduli space.
