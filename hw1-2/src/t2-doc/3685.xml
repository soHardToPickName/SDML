Spacetime structure of massive gravitino
</title>

<abstract>
  We present reasons as to why an ab initio analysis of the spacetime structure
of massive gravitino is necessary. Afterwards, we construct the relevant
representation space, and finally, give a new physical interpretation of
massive gravitino.
