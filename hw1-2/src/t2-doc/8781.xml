Ultraviolet and Infrared freedom from string amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  The infinite tension limit of string amplitudes is examined with some care,
identifying the part responsible of diamagnetic behaviour as well as a peculiar
paramagnetic {\em tachyon magnifying} responsible of asymptotic freedom. The
way string theory represents abelian gauge theories is connected with the
non-planar reggeon/pomeron amplitude and a nontrivial beta function is found in
the low energy limit of a single D-brane.
