Anisotropic Four-Dimensional NS-NS String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  An anisotropic (Bianchi type I) cosmology is considered in the
four-dimensional NS-NS sector of low-energy effective string theory coupled to
a dilaton and an axion-like $H$-field within a de Sitter-Einstein frame
background. The time evolution of this Universe is discussed in both the
Einstein and string frames.
