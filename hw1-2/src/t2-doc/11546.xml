Steps towards Lattice Virasoro Algebras: su(1,1)
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit construction is presented for the action of the su(1,1)
subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra on path spaces for the c(2,q) minimal
models. In the case of the Lee-Yang edge singularity, we show how this action
already fixes the central charge of the full Virasoro algebra. For this case,
we additionally construct a representation in terms of generators of the
corresponding Temperley-Lieb algebra.
