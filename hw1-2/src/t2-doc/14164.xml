Fermion Condensates and the Trivial Vacuum of Light-Cone Quantum Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the definition of condensates within light-cone quantum field
theory. As the vacuum state in this formulation is trivial, we suggest to
abstract vacuum properties from the particle spectrum. The latter can in
principle be calculated by solving the eigenvalue problem of the light-cone
Hamiltonian. We focus on fermionic condensates which are order parameters of
chiral symmetry breaking. As a paradigm identity we use the
Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation between the quark condensate and the observable
pion mass. We examine the analogues of this relation in the `t~Hooft and
Schwinger model, respectively. A brief discussion of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model is added.
