Gauge-field mixing in supersymmetric cosmic string theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, following a stream of investigation of supersymetric gauge
theories with cosmic string solutions, we contemplate the possibility of
building up a superconducting cosmic string with a gauge-field mixing in
conection with to a U(1) x U(1)'-symmetry. Both spontaneous breakings, of gauge
and supersymmetry, are thoroughly analysed and the fermion zero-modes are
worked out. The role of the gauge-field mixing parameter is elucidated in
conection with the string configuration.
