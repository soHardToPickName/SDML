Variational Formulation of Linear Time-Dependent Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that linear time-dependent invariants for arbitrary
multi\-dimensional quadratic systems can be obtained from the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian formulation procedures by considering a variation of coordinates
and momenta that follows the classical trajectory and defines a noetherian
symmetry transformation.
