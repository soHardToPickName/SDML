Inequivalent Quantization in the Skyrme Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum mechanics on manifolds is not unique and in general infinite number
of inequivalent quantizations can be considered. They are specified by the
induced spin and the induced gauge structures on the manifold. The
configuration space of collective mode in the Skyrme model can be identified
with $S^{3}$ and thus the quantization is not unique. This leads to the
different predictions for the physical observables.
