On the existence of additional solutions for equations in the 
  $(1/2,0)\oplus (0,1/2)$ representation space
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze dispersion relations of the equations recently proposed by
Ahluwalia for describing neutrino. Equations for type-II spinors are deduced on
the basis of the Wigner rules for left- and right- 2-spinors and the
Ryder-Burgard relation. It is shown that equations contain acausal solutions
which are similar to those of the Dirac-like second-order equation. The latter
is obtained in a similar way, provided that we do not apply to any constraints
in the process of its deriving.
