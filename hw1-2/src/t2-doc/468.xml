Finite particle creation in 3+1 de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we calculate the particle creation as seen by a stationary
observer in 3+1 de Sitter space. This particle creation is calculated using an
observer dependent geometrically based definition of time which is used to
quantize a field on two different spacelike surfaces. The Bogolubov
transformation relating these two quantizations is then calculated and the
resulting particle creation is shown to be finite.
