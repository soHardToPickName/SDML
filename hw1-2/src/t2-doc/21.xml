Extended Objects from Warped Compactifications of M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the massive spectrum of fully wrapped branes in warped M-theory
compactifications, including regimes where these states are parametrically
lighter than the Planck scale or string scale. We show that many such states
behave classically as extended objects in the noncompact directions in the
sense that their mass grows with their size as measured along the Poincare
slices making up the noncompact dimensions. On the other hand these states can
be quantized in a nontrivial regime: in particular their spectrum of
excitations in a limited regime can be obtained by a warped Kaluza-Klein
reduction from ten dimensions. We briefly discuss scattering processes and loop
effects involving these states, and also note the possibility of an exponential
growth in the number of bound states of these objects as a function of energy.
