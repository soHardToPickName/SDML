Towards Evaluation of Stringy Non-Perturbative Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on progress towards evaluation of stringy non-perturbative effects,
using a two dimensional effective field theory for matrix models. We briefly
discuss the relevance of such effects to models of dynamical supersymmetry
breaking.
