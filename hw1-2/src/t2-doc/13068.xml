Field-to-particle transition based on the zero-brane approach to
  quantization of multiscalar field theories and its application for
  Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The field-to-particle transition formalizm based on the effective zero-brane
action approach is generalized for arbitrary multiscalar fields. As a fruitful
example, by virtue of this method we derive the non-minimal particle action for
the Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity at fixed gauge in the vicinity of the black hole
solution as an instanton-dilaton doublet. When quantizing it as the theory with
higher derivatives, it is shown that the appearing quantum equation has SU(2)
dynamical symmetry group realizing the exact spin-coordinate correspondence.
Finally, we calculate the quantum corrections to the mass of the JT black hole.
