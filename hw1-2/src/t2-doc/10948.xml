Non-Commutative Geometry, Multiscalars, and the Symbol Map
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the concept of the universal exterior algebra in
non-commutative differential geometry we construct differential forms on the
quantum phase-space of an arbitrary system. They bear the same natural
relationship to quantum dynamics which ordinary tensor fields have with respect
to classical hamiltonian dynamics.
