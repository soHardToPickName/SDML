Finite temperature resolution of the Klebanov-Tseytlin singularity
</title>

<abstract>
  Naked singularities in the gravitational backgrounds dual to gauge theories
can be hidden behind the black hole horizon. We present an exact black hole
solution in the Klebanov-Tseytlin geometry [hep-th/0002159]. Our solution
realizes Maldacena dual of the finite temperature N=1 duality cascade of
[hep-th/0007191] above the temperature of the chiral symmetry breaking. We
compare the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black hole with the entropy of
the SU(N+M)xSU(N) gauge theory.
