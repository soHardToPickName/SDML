D-branes and constant electro-magnetic backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We probe the effective worldvolume theory of a set of coinciding D-branes by
switching on constant electro-magnetic fields on them. The comparison of the
mass spectrum predicted by string theory with the mass spectrum obtained from
the effective action provides insights in the structure of the effective
theory.
