BPS States, String Duality, and Nodal Curves on K3
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the counting of BPS states of Type II strings on K3 by relating
the supersymmetric cycles of genus $g$ to the number of rational curves with
$g$ double points on K3. The generating function for the number of such curves
is the left-moving partition function of the bosonic string.
