Noncommutative Differential Geometry and Connections on Simplicial
  Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  For a simplicial manifold we construct the differential geometry structure
and use it to investigate linear connections, metric and gravity. We discuss
and compare three main approaches and calculate the resulting gravity action
functionals.
