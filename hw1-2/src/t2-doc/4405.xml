A Holographic Interpretation of Asymptotically de Sitter Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  One of the remarkable outcomes of the AdS/CFT correspondence has been the
generalization of Cardy's entropy formula for arbitrary dimensionality, as well
as a variety of anti-de Sitter scenarios. More recently, related work has been
done in the realm of asymptotically de Sitter backgrounds. Such studies presume
a well-defined dS/CFT duality, which has not yet attained the credibility of
its AdS analogue. In this paper, we derive and interpret generalized forms of
the Cardy entropy for a selection of asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. These
include the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole (as a review of hep-th/0112093),
the Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black hole and a special class of topological
de Sitter solutions. Each of these cases is found to have interesting
implications in the context of the proposed correspondence.
