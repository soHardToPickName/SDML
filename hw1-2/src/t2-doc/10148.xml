The Hausdorff dimension in polymerized quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the Hausdorff dimension, $d_H$, and the correlation function
exponent, $\eta$, for polymerized two dimensional quantum gravity models. If
the non-polymerized model has correlation function exponent $\eta_0 >3$ then
$d_H=\gamma^{-1}$ where $\gamma$ is the susceptibility exponent. This suggests
that these models may be in the same universality class as certain non-generic
branched polymer models.
