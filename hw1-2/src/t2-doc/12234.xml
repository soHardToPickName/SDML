A Note on Symplectic, Multisymplectic Scheme in Finite Element Method
</title>

<abstract>
  We find that with uniform mesh, the numerical schemes derived from finite
element method can keep a preserved symplectic structure in one-dimensional
case and a preserved multisymplectic structure in two-dimentional case in
certain discrete version respectively. These results are in fact the intrinsic
reason that the numerical experiments indicate that such finite element
algorithms are accurate in practice.
