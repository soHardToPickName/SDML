Bosonization of $QED_3$ with an induced Chern - Simons term
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the bosonization of $2+1$ - dimensional QED with one fermionic
flavor performed previously to the case of QED with an induced Chern - Simons
term. The coefficient of this term is quantized: $e^2n/8\pi$, $n\in {\bf Z}$.
The fermion operators are constructed in terms of the bosonic fields $A_i$ and
$E_i$. The construction is similar to that in the $n=0$ case. The resulting
bosonic theory is Lorentz invariant in the continuum limit and has Maxwell's
equations as its equations of motion. The algebra of bilinears exhibits
nontrivial operatorial mixing with lower dimensional operators, which is absent
for $n=0$.
