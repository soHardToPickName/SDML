Minimal Supersymmetric CPN Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric CPN models based on underlying bosonic Kahler manifolds have
not been thought to arise directly from constrained linear ones. A
counterexample for N=4 is presented using improved understanding of membranes
in superstring theories leading to crucial central terms modifying the algebra
of supercharge densities. The example has an immediate extension to all higher
N.
