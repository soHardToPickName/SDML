Combinatorial Solution of the Two-Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We write down and solve a closed set of Schwinger-Dyson equations for the
two-matrix model in the large $N$ limit. Our elementary method yields exact
solutions for correlation functions involving angular degrees of freedom whose
calculation was impossible with previously known techniques. The result
sustains the hope that more complicated matrix models important for lattice
string theory and QCD may also be solvable despite the problem of the angular
integrations. As an application of our method we briefly discuss the
calculation of wavefunctions with general matter boundary conditions for the
Ising model coupled to $2D$ quantum gravity. Some novel insights into the
relationship between lattice and continuum boundary conditions are obtained.
