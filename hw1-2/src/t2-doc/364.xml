Soliton Solutions of the Integrable Chiral Model in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present soliton and soliton-antisoliton solutions for the integrable
chiral model in 2+1 dimensions with nontrivial (elastic) scattering. These
solutions can be obtained either as the limiting cases of the ones already
constructed by Ward or by adapting Uhlenbeck's method.
