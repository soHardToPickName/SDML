Fivebrane Lagrangian with Loop Corrections in Field-Theory Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  Equations of motion and the lagrangian are derived explicitely for Dual D=10,
N=1 Supergravity considered as a field theory limit of a Fivebrane. It is used
the mass-shell solution of Heterotic String Bianchi Identites obtained in the
2-dimensional $\sigma$-model two-loop approximation and in the tree-level
Heterotic String approximation. As a result the Dual Supergravity lagrangian is
derived in the one-loop Five-Brane approximation and in the lowest
6-dimensional $\sigma$-model approximaton.
