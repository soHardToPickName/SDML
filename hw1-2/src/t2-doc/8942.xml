Open string states and D-brane tension from vacuum string field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a description of open string fields on a D25-brane in vacuum
string field theory. We show that the tachyon mass is correctly reproduced from
our proposal and further argue that the mass spectrum of all other open string
states is correctly obtained as well. We identify the string coupling constant
from the three-tachyon coupling and show that the tension of a D25-brane is
correctly expressed in terms of the coupling constant, which resolves the
controversy in the literature. We also discuss a reformulation of our
description which is rather similar to boundary string field theory.
