A Comment on Curvature Effects In CFTs And The Cardy-Verlinde Formula
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the Cardy-Verlinde formula for finite temperature N=4 Super
Yang-Mills theory on $R\times S^3$, and its AdS dual. We find that curvature
effects introduce non-trivial corrections to thermodynamic quantities computed
on both sides. We find a modified version of the Cardy-Verlinde formula for the
SYM theory, incorporating these. On the gravity side, these corrections imply
that the Cardy-Verlinde formula is exact.
