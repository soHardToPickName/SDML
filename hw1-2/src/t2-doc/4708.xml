Avoiding the theorem of Lerche and Shore

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric $\sigma$-models obtained by constraining linear supersymmetric
field theories are ill defined. Well defined subsectors parametrising Kahler
manifolds exist but are not believed to arise directly from constrained linear
ones. A counterexample is offered using improved understanding of membranes in
superstring theories leading to crucial central terms modifying the algebra of
supercharge densities
