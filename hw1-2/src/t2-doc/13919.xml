Tachyonic neutrinos?
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that tachyons are associated with unitary representations of
Poincare mappings induced from SO(2) little group instead of SO(2,1) one. This
allows us to treat more seriously possibility that neutrinos are fermionic
tachyons according to the present experimental data.
