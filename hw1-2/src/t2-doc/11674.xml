Multifractality of time and space, covariant derivatives and gauge
  invariance

<abstract>
  A possibility to represent the standard model of fundamental particles
covariant derivatives by means of approximate generalized fractional
Riemann-Liouville derivatives of multifractal time and space model is shown.
