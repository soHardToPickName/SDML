The Quantum Supersymmetric Vector Multiplet and Some Problems in
  Non-Abelian Supergauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the supersymmetric vector multiplet in a purely quantum
framework. We obtain some discrepancies with respect to the literature in the
expression of the super-propagator and we prove that the model is consistent
only for positive mass. The gauge structure is constructed purely deductive and
leads to the necessity of introducing scalar ghost superfields, in analogy to
the usual gauge theories. The construction of a consistent supersymmetric gauge
theory based on the vector model depends crucially one the definition of gauge
invariance. We find some significant difficulties to impose a supersymmetric
gauge invariance condition for the usual expressions from the literature.
