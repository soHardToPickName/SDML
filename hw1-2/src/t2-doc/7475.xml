Supersymmetry and gauge theory on Calabi-Yau 3-folds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the dimensional reduction of supersymmetric Yang-Mills on a
Calabi-Yau 3-fold. We show by construction how the resulting cohomological
theory is related to the balanced field theory of the Kaehler Yang-Mills
equations introduced by Donaldson and Uhlenbeck-Yau.
