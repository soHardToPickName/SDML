Fractal Statistics and Quantum Black Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  Simple considerations about the fractal characteristic of the
quantum-mechanical path give us the opportunity to derive the quantum black
hole entropy in connection with the concept of fractal statistics. We show the
geometrical origin of the numerical factor of four of the quantum black hole
entropy expression and the statistics weight appears as a counting of the
quanta of geometry.
