O(d, d)-Symmetry and Ernst Formulation for Einstein-Kalb-Ramond Theory
  in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The (3+d)-dimensional Einstein-Kalb-Ramond theory reduced to two dimensions
is considered. It is shown that the theory allows two different Ernst-like $d
\times d$ matrix formulations: the real non-dualized target space and the
Hermitian dualized non-target space ones. The O(d, d) symmetry is written in a
SL(2,R) matrix-valued form in both cases. The Kramer-Neugebauer transformation,
which algebraically maps the non-dualized Ernst potential into the dualized
one, is presented.
