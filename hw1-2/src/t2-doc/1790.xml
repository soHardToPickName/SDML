Front form QED(3+1): The spin-multiplet structure of the positronium
  spectrum at strong coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  Numerical results on the positronium spectrum in the front form of QED at
large coupling constant are presented. Emphasis is put on the question whether
one can derive an effective interaction at all, and whether this effective
interaction is rotationally invariant. (Proceedings of Les Houches 1997)
