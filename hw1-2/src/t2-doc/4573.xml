Singular Quantum Mechanical Viewpoint of Localized Gravity in
  Brane-World Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  The graviton localized on the 3-brane is examined in Randall-Sundrum
brane-world scenario from the viewpoint of one-dimensional singular quantum
mechanics. For the Randall-Sundrum single brane scenario the one-parameter
family of the fixed-energy amplitude is explicitly computed where the free
parameter $\xi$ parametrizes the various boundary conditions at the brane. The
general criterion for the localized graviton to be massless is derived when
$\xi$ is arbitrary but non-zero. When $\xi=0$, the massless graviton is
obtained via a coupling constant renormalization. For the two branes picture
the fixed-energy amplitude is in general dependent on the two free parameters.
The numerical test indicates that there is no massless graviton in this
picture. For the positive-tension brane, however, the localized graviton
becomes massless when the distance between branes are infinitely large, which
is essentially identical to the single brane picture. For the negative-tension
brane there is no massless graviton regardless of the distance between branes
and choice of boundary conditions.
