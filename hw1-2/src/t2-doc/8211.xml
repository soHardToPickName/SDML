Example of q-deformed Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory with the single-valued anyonic field
is proposed as an example of q-deformed field theory. The corresponding
q-deformed algebra interpolating between bosons and fermions,both in position
and momentum spaces, is analyzed.A possible generalization to a space with an
arbitrary dimension is suggested.
