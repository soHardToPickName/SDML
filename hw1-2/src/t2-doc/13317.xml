The Spinning Particles as a Nonlinear Realizations of the Superworldline
  Reparametrization Invariance

<abstract>
  The superdiffeomorphisms invariant description of $N$ - extended spinning
particle is constructed in the framework of nonlinear realizations approach.
The action is universal for all values of $N$ and describes the time evolution
of $D+2$ different group elements of the superdiffeomorphisms group of the
$(1,N)$ superspace. The form of this action coincides with the one-dimensional
version of the gravity action, analogous to Trautman's one.
