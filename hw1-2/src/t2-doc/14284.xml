A New Duality Symmetry in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the conformal gauging of non-abelian groups. In such cases there
are inequivalent ways of gauging (generalizing the axial and vector cases for
abelian groups) corresponding to external automorphisms of the group. Different
$\s$-models obtained this way correspond to the same conformal field theory. We
use the method of quotients to formulate this equivalence as a new duality
symmetry.
