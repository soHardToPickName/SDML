Difference equations for correlation functions of $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$-face
  model with boundary reflection
</title>

<abstract>
  The $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$-face model with boundary reflection is considered on the
basis of the boundary CTM bootstrap. We construct the fused boundary Boltzmann
weights to determine the normalization factor. We derive difference equations
of the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov type for correlation functions of the
boundary model. The simplest difference equations are solved the in the case of
the free boundary condition.
