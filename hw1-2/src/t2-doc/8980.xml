Spacetime Duality and Superduality
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new class of duality symmetries amongst quantum field
theories. The new class is based upon global spacetime symmetries, such as
Poincare invariance and supersymmetry, in the same way as the existing duality
transformations are based on global internal symmetries.
 We illustrate these new duality transformations by dualizing several scalar
and spin-half theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, involving nonsupersymmetric
as well as (1,1) and (2,2) supersymmetric models. For
 (2,2) models the new duality transformations can interchange chiral and
twisted-chiral multiplets.
