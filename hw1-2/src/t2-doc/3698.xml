Near-horizon behavior of string-loop-corrected dyonic black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Dyonic black holes with string-loop corrections are studied in the
near-horizon region. In perturbative heterotic string theory compactified to
four dimensions with N=2 supersymmetry, in the first order in string-loop
expansion parameter, we solve the system of Maxwell and Killing spinor
equations for dyonic black hole. At the horizon, the string-loop-corrected
solution displays restoration of spontaneously broken supersymmetry.
