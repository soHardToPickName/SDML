Fuzzy Gravitons From Uncertain Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently proposed remarkable mechanism explaining ``stringy exclusion
principle" on an Anti de Sitter space is shown to be another beautiful
manifestation of spacetime uncertainty principle in string theory as well as in
M theory. Put in another way, once it is realized that the graviton of a given
angular momentum is represented by a spherical brane, we deduce the maximal
angular momentum directly from either the relation $\Delta t\Delta x^2>l_p^3$
in M theory or $\Delta t\Delta x>\ap$ in string theory. We also show that the
result of hep-th/0003075 is similar to results on D2-branes in SU(2) WZW model.
Using the dual D2-brane representation of a membrane, we obtain the
quantization condition for the size of the membrane.
