Extra Dirac Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper has rather a pedagogical meaning. Surprising symmetries in the
$(j,0)\oplus (0,j)$ Lorentz group representation space are analyzed. The aim is
to draw reader's attention to the possibility of describing the particle world
on the ground of the Dirac "doubles". Several tune points of the variational
principle for this kind of equations are briefly discussed.
