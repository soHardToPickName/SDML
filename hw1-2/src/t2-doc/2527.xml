On quark mass correction to the string potential
</title>

<abstract>
  Following recent work by Lambiase and Nesterenko we study in detail the
interquark potential for a Nambu-Goto string with point masses attached to its
ends. We obtain exact solutions to the gap equations for the Lagrange
multipliers and metric components and determine the potential without
simplifying assumptions. We also discuss L\"{u}scher term and argue that it
remains universal.
