String bits and the Myers effect
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the non-abelian effective action for D1-branes, a new action for
matrix string theory in non-trivial backgrounds is proposed. Once the
background fields are included, new interactions bring the possibility of
non-commutative solutions i.e. The Myers effect for ``string bits'' .
