Beyond Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Superstring theory, and a recent extension called M theory, are leading
candidates for a quantum theory that unifies gravity with the other forces. As
such, they are certainly not ordinary quantum field theories. However, recent
duality conjectures suggest that a more complete definition of these theories
can be provided by the large N limits of suitably chosen U(N) gauge theories
associated to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime.
