Properties of derivative expansion approximations to the renormalization
  group
</title>

<abstract>
  Approximation only by derivative (or more generally momentum) expansions,
combined with reparametrization invariance, turns the continuous
renormalization group for quantum field theory into a set of partial
differential equations which at fixed points become non-linear eigenvalue
equations for the anomalous scaling dimension $\eta$. We review how these
equations provide a powerful and robust means of discovering and approximating
non-perturbative continuum limits. Gauge fields are briefly discussed.
Particular emphasis is placed on the r\^ole of reparametrization invariance,
and the convergence of the derivative expansion is addressed.
