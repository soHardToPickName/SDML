Quantum Background Independence In String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Not only in physical string theories, but also in some highly simplified
situations, background independence has been difficult to understand. It is
argued that the ``holomorphic anomaly'' of Bershadsky, Cecotti, Ooguri, and
Vafa gives a fundamental explanation of some of the problems. Moreover, their
anomaly equation can be interpreted in terms of a rather peculiar quantum
version of background independence: in systems afflicted by the anomaly,
background independence does not hold order by order in perturbation theory,
but the exact partition function as a function of the coupling constants has a
background independent interpretation as a state in an auxiliary quantum
Hilbert space. The significance of this auxiliary space is otherwise unknown.
