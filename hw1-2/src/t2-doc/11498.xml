Thermodynamics of Kerr Newman de Sitter Black Hole and dS/CFT
  Correspondence

<abstract>
  We compute the conserved quantities of the four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-dS
(KNdS) black hole through the use of dS/CFT correspondence, and obtain a
generalized Smarr formula for the mass as a function of the entropy, the
angular momentum and the electric charge. The first law of thermodynamics
associated to the cosmological horizon of KNdS is also investigated. Using the
minimal number of intrinsic boundary counterterms, we consider the quasilocal
thermodynamics of asymptotic de Sitter Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, and find
that the temperature is equal to the product of the surface gravity (divided by
$2\pi$) and the Tolman redshift factor. We also perform a quasilocal stability
analysis by computing the determinant of Hessian matrix of the energy with
respect to its thermodynamic variables in both the canonical and the
grand-canonical ensembles and obtain a complete set of phase diagrams. We then
turn to the quasilocal thermodynamics of four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-de Sitter
black hole for virtually all possible values of the mass, the rotation and the
charge parameters that leave the quasilocal boundary inside the cosmological
event horizon, and perform a quasilocal stability analysis of KNdS black hole.
