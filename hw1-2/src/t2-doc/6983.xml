Magnetic Z(N) symmetry in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  This review describes the role of magnetic symmetry in 2+1 dimensional gauge
theories. In confining theories without matter fields in fundamental
representation the magnetic symmetry is spontaneously broken. Under some mild
assumptions, the low-energy dynamics is determined universally by this
spontaneous breaking phenomenon. The degrees of freedom in the effective theory
are magnetic vortices. Their role in confining dynamics is similar to that
played by pions and sigma in the chiral symmetry breaking dynamics.
 I give an explicit derivation of the effective theory in (2+1)-dimensional
weakly coupled confining models and argue that it remains qualitatively the
same in strongly coupled (2+1)-dimensional gluodynamics. Confinement in this
effective theory is a very simple classical statement about the long range
interaction between topological solitons, which follows (as a result of a
simple direct classical calculation) from the structure of the effective
Lagrangian. I show that if fundamentally charged dynamical fields are present
the magnetic symmetry becomes local rather than global. The modifications to
the effective low energy description in the case of heavy dynamical fundamental
matter are discussed. This effective lagrangian naturally yields a bag like
description of baryonic excitations. I also discuss the fate of the magnetic
symmetry in gauge theories with the Chern-Simons term.
