Stability of the quantum supermembrane in a manifold with boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out an effect which may stabilize a supersymmetric membrane moving
on a manifold with boundary, and lead to a light-cone Hamiltonian with a
discrete spectrum of eigenvalues. The analysis is carried out explicitly for a
closed supermembrane in the regularized $SU(N)$ matrix model version.
