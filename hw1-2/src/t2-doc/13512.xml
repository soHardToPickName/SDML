Quantum Solitons in Non-Linear Optics: Resonant Dielectric Media
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known that classical electromagnetic radiation at a frequency in
resonance with energy splittings of atoms in a dielectric medium can be
described using the classical sine-Gordon equation. In this paper we quantize
the electromagnetic field and compute quantum corrections to the classical
results by using known results from the sine-Gordon quantum field theory.
