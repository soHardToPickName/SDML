Noncommutative spheres and the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We present direct arguments for non-commutativity of spheres in the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The discussion is based on results for the $S_N$ orbifold SCFT.
Concentrating on three point correlations (at finite $N$) we exhibit a
comparison with correlations on a non-commutative sphere. In this manner an
essential signature of non-commutativity is identified giving further support
for the original proposal of hep-th/9902059.
