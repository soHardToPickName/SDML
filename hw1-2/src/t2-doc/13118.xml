A Varying-alpha Brane World Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the brane world cosmology in the RS2 model where the electric charge
varies with time in the manner described by the varying fine-structure constant
theory of Bekenstein. We map such varying electric charge cosmology to the dual
variable-speed-of-light cosmology by changing system of units. We comment on
cosmological implications for such cosmological models.
