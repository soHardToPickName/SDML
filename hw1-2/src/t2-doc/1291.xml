Tachyon Hair for Two-Dimensional Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, we obtain a
two-dimensional spacetime describing a black hole with tachyon hair. The
physical ADM mass of the black hole is finite. The presence of tachyon hair
increases the Hawking temperature.
