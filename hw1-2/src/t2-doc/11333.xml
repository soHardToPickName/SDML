A Lie Group Structure Underlying the Triplectic Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the pair of degenerate compatible antibrackets satisfying a
generalization of the axioms imposed in the triplectic quantization of gauge
theories. We show that this actually encodes a Lie group structure, with the
antibrackets being related to the left- and right- invariant vector fields on
the group. The standard triplectic quantization axioms then correspond to
Abelian groups.
