Considerations of One-Modulus Calabi-Yau Compactifications: Picard-Fuchs
  Equations, K\"ahler Potentials and Mirror Maps
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Calabi-Yau compactifications with one K\"ahler modulus. Following
the method of Candelas et al. we use the mirror hypothesis to solve the quantum
theory exactly in dependence of this modulus by performing the calculation for
the corresponding complex structure deformation on the mirror manifold. Here
the information is accessible by techniques of classical geometry. It is
encoded in the Picard-Fuchs differential equation which has to be supplemented
by requirements on the global properties of its solutions.
