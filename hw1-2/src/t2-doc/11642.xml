p-brane solutions and Beltrami-Laplace operator
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalization of harmonic superposition rule for the case of dependent
choice of harmonic functions is given. Dependence of harmonic functions from
all (relative and overall) transverse coordinates is considered using the
Beltrami-Laplace operator. Supersymmetry of IIB 10D supergravity solutions with
only non-vanished 5-form field and 11D supergravity solutions is discussed.
