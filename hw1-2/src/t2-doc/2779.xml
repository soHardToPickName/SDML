The Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket, cohomology and generalized Poisson
  structures
</title>

<abstract>
  Newly introduced generalized Poisson structures based on suitable
skew-symmetric contravariant tensors of even order are discussed in terms of
the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket. The associated `Jacobi identities' are
expressed as conditions on these tensors, the cohomological contents of which
is given. In particular, we determine the linear generalized Poisson structures
which can be constructed on the dual spaces of simple Lie algebras.
