Conformal Solutions Of Duality Invariant 2D Magnetohydrodynamic
  Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider possible conformal field theory (CFT) descriptions of the various
inertial ranges that exist in $2d$ duality invariant Magnetohydrodynamics. Such
models arise as effective theories of dyonic plasmas in 3 dimensions in which
all fields are independent of the third coordinate. We find new constraints on
the allowed CFT's compared to those that may describe turbulence in $2d$
plasmas of electric charges only. The predictions from CFT concerning
equipartition of energy amongst the electric and magnetic fields are discussed,
and quantities exhibiting universal scaling are derived.
