Four Dimensional Orbit Spaces of Compact Coregular Linear Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  All four dimensional orbit spaces of compact coregular linear groups have
been determined. The results are obtained through the integration of a
universal differential equation, that only requires as input the number of
elements of an integrity basis of the ideal of polynomial invariants of the
linear group. Our results are relevant and lead to universality properties in
the physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking at the classical level.
