Semiclassical analysis of two- and three-spin antiferromagnets and
  anyons on a sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We do a semiclassical analysis for two or three spins which are coupled
antiferromagnetically to each other. The semiclassical wave functions transform
correctly under permutations of the spins if one takes into account the
Wess-Zumino term present in the path integral for spins. The Wess-Zumino term
here is a total derivative which has no effect on the energy spectrum. The
semiclassical problem is related to that of anyons moving on a sphere with the
statistics parameter $\theta$ being $2 \pi S$ for two spins and $3 \pi S$ for
three spins. Finally, we present a novel way of deriving the semiclassical wave
functions from the spin wave functions.
