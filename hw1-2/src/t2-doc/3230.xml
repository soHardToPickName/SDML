Relativistic Calogero-Sutherland Model: Spin Generalization, Quantum
  Affine Symmetry and Dynamical Correlation Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Spin generalization of the relativistic Calogero-Sutherland model is
constructed by using the affine Hecke algebra and shown to possess the quantum
affine symmetry $\uqglt$. The spin-less model is exactly diagonalized by means
of the Macdonald symmetric polynomials. The dynamical density-density
correlation function as well as one-particle Green function are evaluated
exactly. We also investigate the finite-size scaling of the model and show that
the low-energy behavior is described by the $C=1$ Gaussian theory. The results
indicate that the excitations obey the fractional exclusion statistics and
exhibit the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior as well.
