Exact Matrix Elements in Supersymmetric Theories

<abstract>
  The lowest representatives of the Form Factors relative to the trace
operators of N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon Model are exactly calculated. The novelty of
their determination consists in solving a coupled set of unitarity and crossing
equations. Analytic continuations of the Form Factors as functions of the
coupling constant allows the study of interesting models in a uniform way,
among these the latest model of the Roaming Series and the minimal
supersymmetric models as investigated by Schoutens. A fermionic version of the
$c$-theorem is also proved and the corresponding sum-rule derived.
