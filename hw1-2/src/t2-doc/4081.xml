Seiberg-Witten Solution from Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  As another evidence for the matrix Discrete Light Cone formulation of M
theory, we show how general integrable Hamiltonian systems emerge from BPS
bound states of k longitudinal fivebranes. Such configurations preserve eight
supercharges and by chain of dualities can be related to the solution of N=2
four-dimensional gauge theories. Underlying Hitchin systems on the bare
spectral curve with k singular points arise from the Matrix theory
compactification on the dual curve.
