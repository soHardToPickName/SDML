Are Extremal 2D Black Holes Really Frozen ?
</title>

<abstract>
  In the standard methodology for evaluating the Hawking radiation emanating
from a black hole, the background geometry is fixed. Trying to be more
realistic we consider a dynamical geometry for a two-dimensional charged black
hole and we evaluate the Hawking radiation as tunneling process. This
modification to the geometry gives rise to a nonthermal part in the radiation
spectrum. We explore the consequences of this new term for the extremal case.
