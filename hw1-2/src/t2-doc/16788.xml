Two Different Squeeze Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  Lorentz boosts are squeeze transformations. While these transformations are
similar to those in squeezed states of light, they are fundamentally different
from both physical and mathematical points of view. The difference is
illustrated in terms of two coupled harmonic oscillators, and in terms of the
covariant harmonic oscillator formalism.
