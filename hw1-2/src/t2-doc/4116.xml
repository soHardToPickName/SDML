Fusion rules in conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Several aspects of fusion rings and fusion rule algebras, and of their
manifestations in twodimensional (conformal) field theory, are described:
diagonalization and the connection with modular invariance; the presentation in
terms of quotients of polynomial rings; fusion graphs; various strategies that
allow for a partial classification; and the role of the fusion rules in the
conformal bootstrap programme.
