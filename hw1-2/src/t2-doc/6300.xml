Anyonic FRT construction
</title>

<abstract>
  The Faddeev-Reshetikhin-Takhtajan method to construct matrix bialgebras from
non-singular solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation is extended to the
anyonic or $\Z_n$-graded case. The resulting anyonic quantum matrices are
braided groups in which the braiding is given by a phase factor.
