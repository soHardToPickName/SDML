Boundary Liouville Field Theory: Boundary Three Point Function
</title>

<abstract>
  Liouville field theory is considered on domains with conformally invariant
boundary conditions. We present an explicit expression for the three point
function of boundary fields in terms of the fusion coefficients which determine
the monodromy properties of the conformal blocks.
