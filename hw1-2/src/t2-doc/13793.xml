Cosmological Solutions in 2D Poincar\'E Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Abtract: The 2D model of gravity with zweibeins $e^{a}$ and the Lorentz
connection one-form $\omega^{a}_{\ b}$ as independent gravitational variables
is considered. The solutions of classical equations of motion which can be
interpreted as cosmological ones are studied.
