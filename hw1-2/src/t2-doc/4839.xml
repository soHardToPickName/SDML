Varying the Unruh Temperature in Integrable Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A computational scheme is developed to determine the response of a quantum
field theory (QFT) with a factorized scattering operator under a variation of
the Unruh temperature. To this end a new family of integrable systems is
introduced, obtained by deforming such QFTs in a way that preserves the
bootstrap S-matrix. The deformation parameter \beta plays the role of an
inverse temperature for the thermal equilibrium states associated with the
Rindler wedge, \beta = 2\pi being the QFT value. The form factor approach
provides an explicit computational scheme for the \beta \neq 2\pi systems,
enforcing in particular a modification of the underlying kinematical arena. As
examples deformed counterparts of the Ising model and the Sinh-Gordon model are
considered.
