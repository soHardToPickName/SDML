Dynamical Symmetry Breaking on Langevin Equation : Nambu $\cdot$
  Jona-Lasinio Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to investigate dynamical symmetry breaking, we study
Nambu$\cdot$Jona-Lasinio model in the large-N limit in the stochastic
quantization method. Here in order to solve Langevin equation, we impose
specified initial conditions and construct ``effective Langevin equation'' in
the large-N limit and give the same non-perturbative results as path-integral
approach gives. Moreover we discuss stability of vacuum by means of ``effective
potential''.
