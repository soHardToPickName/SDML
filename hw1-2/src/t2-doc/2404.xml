Polynomial Form of the Stueckelberg Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Stueckelberg model for massive vector fields is cast into a BRS
invariant, polynomial form. Its symmetry algebra simplifies to an abelian gauge
symmetry which is sufficient to decouple the negative norm states. The
propagators fall off like $1/k^2$ and the Lagrangean is polynomial but it is
not powercounting renormalizable due to derivative couplings.
