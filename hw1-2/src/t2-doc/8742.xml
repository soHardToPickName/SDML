Three-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes and the Maldacena Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the microscopic states of the extremal BTZ black holes. Degeneracy
of the primary states corresponding to the extremal BTZ black holes in the
boundary N=(4,4) SCFT is obtained by utilizing the elliptic genus and the
unitary representation theory of N=4 SCA. The degeneracy is consistent with the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
