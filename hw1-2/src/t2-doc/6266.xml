The Antighost Equation in N=1 Super-Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The antighost equation valid for usual gauge theories in the Landau gauge, is
generalized to the case of $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories in a
supersymmetric version of the Landau gauge. This equation, which expresses the
nonrenormalization of the Faddeev-Popov ghost field, plays an important role in
the proof of the nonrenormalization theorems for the chiral anomalies.
