Some Three Generation (0,2) Calabi-Yau Models
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been realized that a large class of Calabi-Yau models in
which the VEV of the gauge connection is not set equal to the spin connection
of the Calabi-Yau manifold are valid classical solutions of string theory. We
provide some examples of three generation models based on such generalized
Calabi-Yau compactifications, including models with observable gauge group
$SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$.
