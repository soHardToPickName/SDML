Localized Intersecting Brane Solutions of D=11 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of two-charged intersecting brane solutions of the D=11
supergravity, which contain the M2-brane, M5-brane, Kaluza-Klein monopole or
Brinkmann wave as their building blocks. These solutions share the common
feature that one charge is smeared out or uniform over all spatial directions
occupied by the branes or waves, while the other charge is localized in them.
