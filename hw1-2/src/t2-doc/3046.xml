The partition function of the linear Poisson-sigma model on arbitrary
  surfaces

<abstract>
  We perform the calculation of the partition function of the Poisson-sigma
model on the world sheet with the topology of a two-dimensional disc.
Considering the special case of a linear Poisson structure we recover the
partition function of the Yang-Mills theory. Using a glueing procedure we are
able to calculate the partition function for arbitrary base manifolds.
