Superpotential of the M-theory conifold and type IIA string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The membrane instanton superpotential for $M$-theory on the $G_2$ holonomy
manifold given by the cone on ${\bf S^3}\x {\bf S^3}$ is given by the
dilogarithm and has Heisenberg monodromy group in the quantum moduli space. We
compare this to a Heisenberg group action on the type IIA hypermultiplet moduli
space for the universal hypermultiplet, to metric corrections from membrane
instantons related to a twisted dilogarithm for the deformed conifold and to a
flat bundle related to a conifold period, the Heisenberg group and the
dilogarithm appearing in five-dimensional Seiberg/Witten theory.
