Colours associated to non simply-laced Lie algebras and exact S-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  A new set of exact scattering matrices in 1+1 dimensions is proposed by
solving the bootstrap equations. Extending earlier constructions of colour
valued scattering matrices this new set has its colour structure associated to
non simply-laced Lie algebras. This in particular leads to a coupling of
different affine Toda models whose fusing structure has to be matched in a
suitable manner. The definition of the new S-matrices is motivated by the
semi-classical particle spectrum of the non simply-laced Homogeneous
Sine-Gordon (HSG) models, which are integrable perturbations of WZNW cosets. In
particular, the S-matrices of the simply-laced HSG models are recovered as a
special case.
