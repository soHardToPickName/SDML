Correlators in N=1 SYM(2+1)
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a calculation of the correlator <0|T^{++}(r) T^{++}(0) |0> in N=1
SYM theory in 2+1 dimensions. In the calculation, we use supersymmetric
discrete light-cone quantization (SDLCQ), which preserves the supersymmetry at
every step of the calculation. For small and intermediate r the correlator
converges rapidly for all couplings. At small r the correlator behaves like
1/r^6, as expected. At large r the correlator is dominated by the BPS states of
the theory. We find a critical coupling where the large-r correlator goes to
zero; it grows like the square root of the transverse cutoff.
