Embedding Branes in Flat Two-time Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how non-near horizon, non-dilatonic $p$-brane theories can be
obtained from two embedding constraints in a flat higher dimensional space with
2 time directions. In particular this includes the construction of D3 branes
from a flat 12-dimensional action, and M2 and M5 branes from 13 dimensions. The
worldvolume actions are found in terms of fields defined in the embedding
space, with the constraints enforced by Lagrange multipliers.
