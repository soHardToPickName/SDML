On the Group Structure of the Kalb-Ramond Gauge Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The transformation properties of a Kalb-Ramond field are those of a gauge
field; however, it is not clear which is the group structure these
transformations are associated with. The purpose of this letter is to establish
a basic framework in order to clarify the group structure underneath the 2-form
gauge potential.
