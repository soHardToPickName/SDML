Noncommutative Parameters of Quantum Symmetries and Star Products
</title>

<abstract>
  The star product technique translates the framework of local fields on
noncommutative space-time into nonlocal fields on standard space-time. We
consider the example of fields on $\kappa$- deformed Minkowski space,
transforming under $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group with noncommutative
parameters. By extending the star product to the tensor product of functions on
$\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space and $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'{e} group we
represent the algebra of noncommutative parameters of deformed relativistic
symmetries by functions on classical Poincar\'{e} group.
