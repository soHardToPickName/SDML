Fermi-Bose Transmutation for Stringlike Excitations of Maxwell-Higgs
  Systems
</title>

<abstract>
Abstract: We show that a closed Nielsen-Olesen string in presence of a point
scalar source exhibits the phenomenon of Fermi-Bose transmutation. This
provides physical support to previous claims about transmutation between
bosonic and fermionic one-dimensional structures in (3+1) dimensions. In order
to render the computations mathematically rigorous we have resorted to an
Euclidean lattice regularization.
