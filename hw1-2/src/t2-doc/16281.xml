Massless black hole pairs in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the zero mass black holes that arise as classical solutions to low
energy heterotic string theory. Though these solutions contain naked
singularities, it has been conjectured that they should be allowed in the
theory. We find a solution describing a pair of oppositely charged massless
black holes in uniformly accelerated motion under no external force. By
analytically continuing the solution to Euclidean time, we find an instanton
mediating the pair production of these objects in Minkowski space. We analyze
the creation rate, and discuss some consequences of the result.
