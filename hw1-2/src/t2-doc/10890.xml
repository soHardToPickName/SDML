Unification of Gravity, Gauge and Higgs Fields by Confined Quantum
  Fields II -Effective Theory-
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamics of quantized free fields ( of spin 0 and 1/2 ) contained in a
subspace $V_*$ of an N+4 dimensional flat space $V$ is studied. The space $V_*$
is considered as a neighborhood of a four dimensional submanifold $M$
arbitrarily embedded into $V$. We show that Einstein SO(N)-Yang-Mills Higgs
theory is induced as a low energy effective theory of the system. Gravity,
SO(N) gauge fields and Higgs fields are obtained from embedding functions of
$M$.
