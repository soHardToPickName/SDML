D-branes in Massive IIA and Solitons in Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate D2-branes and D4-branes parallel to D8-branes. The low energy
world volume theory on the branes is non-supersymmetric Chern-Simons theory. We
identify the fundamental strings as the anyons of the 2+1 Chern-Simons theory
and the D0-branes as solitons. The Chern-Simons theory with a boundary is
modeled using NS 5-branes with ending D6-branes. The brane set-up provides for
a graphical description of anomaly inflow. We also model the 4+1 Chern-Simons
theory using branes and conjecture that D4-branes with a boundary describes a
supersymmetric version of Kaplan's theory of chiral fermions.
