The energy of the high-temperature quark-gluon plasma
</title>

<abstract>
  For the quark-gluon plasma, an energy-momentum tensor is found corresponding
to the high-temperature Braaten-Pisarski effective action. The tensor is found
by considering the interaction of the plasma with a weak gravitational field
and the positivity of the energy is studied. In addition, the complete
effective action in curved spacetime is written down.
