On the quantum Poincare' group
</title>

<abstract>
  The inhomogeneous quantum groups $IGL_q(n)$ are obtained by means of a
particular projection of $GL_q(n+1)$. The bicovariant differential calculus on
$GL_q(n)$ is likewise projected into a consistent bicovariant calculus on
$IGL_q(n)$. Applying the same method to $GL_q(n,\Cb)$ leads to a bicovariant
calculus for the complex inhomogeneous quantum groups $IGL_q(n,\Cb)$. The
quantum Poincare' group and its bicovariant geometry are recovered by
specializing our results to $ISL_q(2,\Cb)$.
