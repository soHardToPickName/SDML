Massive particle creation in a static 1+1 dimensional spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We show explicitly that there is particle creation in a static spacetime.
This is done by studying the field in a coordinate system based on a physical
principle which has recently been proposed. There the field is quantized by
decomposing it into positive and negative frequency modes on a particular
spacelike surface. This decomposition depends explicitly on the surface where
the decomposition is performed, so that an observer who travels from one
surface to another will observe particle production due to the different vacuum
state.
