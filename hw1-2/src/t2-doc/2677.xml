A remark on the gauging of chiral bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the interacting chiral boson and observe that a naive gauging
procedure leaves the covariant chiral constraint incompatible with the field
equations. Consistency, therefore, rules out most gauging schemes: in a left
chiral scalar, only the coupling with the left chiral currents leads to
consistent results, in discordance with current literature.
