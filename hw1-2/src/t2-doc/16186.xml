Conformal Invariance of Interacting WZNW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two level $k$ WZNW models coupled to each other through a
generalized Thirring-like current-current interaction. It is shown that in the
large $k$ limit, this interacting system can be presented as a two-parameter
perturbation around a nonunitary WZNW model. The perturbation operators are the
sigma model kinetic terms with metric related to the Thirring coupling
constants. The renormalizability of the perturbed model leads to an algebraic
equation for couplings. This equation coincides with the master Virasoro
equation. We find that the beta functions of the two-parameter perturbation
have nontrivial zeros depending on the Thirring coupling constants. Thus we
exhibit that solutions to the master equation provide nontrivial conformal
points to the system of two interacting WZNW models.
