k-Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a large class of higher-order (i.e. non-quadratic) scalar
kinetic terms can, without the help of potential terms, drive an inflationary
evolution starting from rather generic initial conditions. In many models, this
kinetically driven inflation (or "k-inflation" for short) rolls slowly from a
high-curvature initial phase, down to a low-curvature phase and can exit
inflation to end up being radiation-dominated, in a naturally graceful manner.
We hope that this novel inflation mechanism might be useful in suggesting new
ways of reconciling the string dilaton with inflation.
