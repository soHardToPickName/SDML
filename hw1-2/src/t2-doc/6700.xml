On Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider 2+1-dimensional classical noncommutative scalar field theory. The
general ansatz for a radially symmetric solution is obtained. Some exact
solutions are presented. Their possible physical meaning is discussed. The case
of the finite $\theta$ is discussed qualitatively and illustrated by some
numerical results.
