The Renormalisation Group Equation As An Equation For Lie Transport Of
  Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the renormalisation group (RG) equation can be
viewed as an equation for Lie transport of physical amplitudes along the
integral curves generated by the $\beta$-functions of a quantum field theory.
The anomalous dimensions arise from Lie transport of basis vectors on the space
of couplings. The RG equation can be interpreted as relating a particular
diffeomorphism of flat space-(time), that of dilations, to a diffeomorphism on
the space of couplings generated by the vector field associated with the
$\beta$-functions.
