</title>

<abstract>
  Compactifications on tori may seem to have revealed their beauty long ago but
the mystery of 11d Supergravity remains and fresh attempts at a conceptual
breakthrough are worth the effort and quite timely. We shall concentrate here
on the analogy with Instanton Mathematics and discuss some open questions and
work in progress.
