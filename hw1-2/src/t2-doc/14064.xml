Thermal partition function of photons and gravitons in a Rindler wedge
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermal partition function of photons in any covariant gauge and
gravitons in the harmonic gauge, propagating in a Rindler wedge, are computed
using a local $\zeta$-function regularization approach. The correct Planckian
leading order temperature dependence $T^4$ is obtained in both cases. For the
photons, the existence of a surface term giving a negative contribution to the
entropy is confirmed, as earlier obtained by Kabat, but this term is shown to
be gauge dependent in the four-dimensional case and, therefore is discarded. It
is argued that similar terms could appear dealing with any integer spin $s\geq
1$ in the massless case and in more general manifolds. Our conjecture is
checked in the case of a graviton in the harmonic gauge, where different
surface terms also appear, and physically consistent results arise dropping
these terms. The results are discussed in relation to the quantum corrections
to the black hole entropy.
