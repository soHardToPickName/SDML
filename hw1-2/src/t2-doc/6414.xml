New Solutions for Evolution of the Scale Factor with a Variable
  Cosmological Term
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmological term is assumed to be a function of time such as $\Lambda
=Ba^{-2}$ where a(t) means the scale factor of standard cosmology. Analytical
solutions for radiation dominated epoch and open universe are found. For closed
universe, k=+1, and for flat universe, k=0, we show a numerical solution. In
general the scenario of Big Bang is preserved in our case for the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmology.
