Lightfront Formalism versus Holography&Chiral Scanning
</title>

<abstract>
  The limitations of the approach based on using fields restricted to the
lightfront (Lightfront Quantization or p$\to \infty $ Frame Approach) which
drive quantum fields towards canonical and ultimately free fields are well
known. Here we propose a new concept which does not suffer from this
limitation. It is based on a procedure which cannot be directly formulated in
terms of pointlike fields but requires ``holographic'' manipulations of the
algebras generated by those fields. We illustrate the new concepts in the
setting of factorizable d=1+1 models and show that the known fact of absence of
ultraviolet problems in those models (in the presence of higher than canonical
dimensions) also passes to their holographic images. In higher spacetime
dimensions d\TEXTsymbol{>}1+1 the holographic image lacks the transversal
localizability; however this can be remedied by doing holography on d-2
additional lightfronts which share one lightray (Scanning by d-1 chiral
conformal theories).
