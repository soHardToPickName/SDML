Vortex Solutions of Nonrelativistic Fermion and Scalar Field Theories
  Coupled to Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We have constructed nonrelativistic fermion and scalar field theories coupled
to a Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge field which admit static multi-vortex
solutions. This is achieved by introducing a magnetic coupling term in addition
to the usual minimal coupling.
