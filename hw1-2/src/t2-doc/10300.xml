Dirac Quantization of Some Singular Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Analyzing the constraint structure of electrodynamics, massive vector bosons,
Dirac fermions and electrodynamics coupled to fermions, we show that Dirac
quantization method leads to appropriate creation-annihilation algebra among
the Forier coefficients of the fields.
