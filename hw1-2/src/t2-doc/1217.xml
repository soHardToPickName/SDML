Shrinking D-Strings Expanding onto a Hypertube
</title>

<abstract>
  A solution to the BI action describing an expanded D3-brane is considered.
The configuration is not supersymmetric but is supported against collapse by
the Poynting vector. In the uniform magnetic field limit, the brane magnetic
charge grows without limit while the energy and the radius of the brane remain
finite. In this limit the brane consists of a large number of small D-strings
forming a hypertube and kept in equilibrium by the electric flux along the
hypertube.
