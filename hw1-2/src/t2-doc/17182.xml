N=1, D=10 Tensionless Superbranes I
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model for tensionless (null) super p-branes in the Hamiltonian
approach and in the framework of a harmonic superspace. The obtained algebra of
Lorentz-covariant, irreducible, first class constraints is such that the BRST
charge corresponds to a first rank system.
