A Supergravity Dual of a (1,0) Field Theory in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a supergravity dual for the $(1,0)$ superconformal field theory in
six dimensions which has $E_8$ global symmetry. Compared to the description of
the (2,0) field theory, the 4-sphere is replaced by a 4-hemisphere, or by
orbifolding the 4-sphere.
