Gauge Invariant Matrix Model for the \^A-\^D-\^E Closed Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The models of triangulated random surfaces embedded in (extended) Dynkin
diagrams are formulated as a gauge-invariant matrix model of Weingarten type.
The double scaling limit of this model is described by a collective field
theory with nonpolynomial interaction.
  The propagator in this field theory is essentially two-loop correlator in the
corresponding string theory.
