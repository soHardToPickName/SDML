Spontaneous Time Asymmetry due to Horizon
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that quantized matter fields in the presence of background metrics
with Horizon exhibit spontaneous time asymmetry. All quantized matter fields
have to vanish at the horizon. Some phenemenological applications of this in
the context of black holes and early universe are considered.
