Light-cone SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and conformal mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The light-cone SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics is analyzed in the framework of the
Dirac`s constraint formalism. Performing a complete Hamiltonian reduction of
the model we found that it is integrable and moreover the resulting
unconstrained system coincides with the so-called conformal mechanics.
