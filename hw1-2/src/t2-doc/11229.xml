Heat trace asymptotics with transmittal boundary conditions and quantum
  brane-world scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectral geometry of an operator of Laplace type on a manifold
with a singular surface. We calculate several first coefficients of the heat
kernel expansion. These coefficients are responsible for divergences and
conformal anomaly in quantum brane-world scenario.
