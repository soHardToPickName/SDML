Generalized $\mu$-Terms from Orbifolds and M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider solutions to the $\mu$-problem originating in the effective low
energy theories, of N=1 orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string,
after supersymmetry breaking. They are consistent with the invariance of the
one loop corrected effective action in the linear representation of the
dilaton. The proposed $\mu$-terms naturally generalize solutions proposed
previously, in the literature, in the context of minimal low energy
supergravity models. They emanate from the connection of the non-perturbative
superpotential to the determinant of the mass matrix of the chiral
compactification modes. Within this approach we discuss the lifting of our
solutions to their M-theory compactification counterparts.
