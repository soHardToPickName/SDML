N = 2 Supersymmetric Quantum Black Holes in Five Dimensional Heterotic
  String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact black hole solutions of the five dimensional heterotic $S$-$T$-$U$
model including all perturbative quantum corrections and preserving $1/2$ of
$N=2$ supersymmetry are studied. It is shown that the quantum corrections yield
a bound on electric charges and harmonic functions of the solutions.
