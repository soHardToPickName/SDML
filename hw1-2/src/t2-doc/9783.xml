On dynamical supergravity interacting with super-p-brane sources
</title>

<abstract>
  We review recent progress in a fully dynamical Lagrangian description of the
supergravity-superbrane interaction. It suggests that the interacting
superfield action, when it exists, is gauge equivalent to the component action
of dynamical supergravity interacting with the bosonic limit of the superbrane.
