Varational Equations and Symmetries in the Lagrangian Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  Symmetries in the Lagrangian formalism of arbitrary order are analysed with
the help of the so-called Anderson-Duchamp-Krupka equations. For the case of
second order equations and a scalar field we establish a polynomial structure
in the second order derivatives. This structure can be used to make more
precise the form of a general symmetry. As an illustration we analyse the case
of Lagrangian equations with Poincar\'e invariance or with universal
invariance.
