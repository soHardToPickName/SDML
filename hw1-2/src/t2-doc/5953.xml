Tachyonic Inflation in the Braneworld Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider cosmological inflation driven by the rolling tachyon in the
context of the braneworld scenario. We show that sufficient inflation
consistent with the observational constraints can be achieved for well defined
upper limits on the five-dimensional mass scale, string mass scale and the
string coupling for the bosonic string.
