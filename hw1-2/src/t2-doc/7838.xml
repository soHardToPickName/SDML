Solvable Lie Algebras, BPS Black Holes and Supergravity Gaugings
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I review both accomplished results and work in progress on the
use of solvable Lie algebras as an intrinsic algebraic characterization of the
scalar field sector of M--theory low energy effective lagrangians. In
particular I review the application of these techniques in obtaining the most
general form of BPS black hole solutions.
