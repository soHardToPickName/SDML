Advances in String Theory in Curved Space Times
</title>

<abstract>
  String Quantum Gravity is motivated and introduced. Advances in the study of
the classical and quantum string dynamics in curved spacetime are reported:
1-New Classes of Exact Multistring solutions in curved spacetimes. 2-Mass
spectrum of Strings in Curved Spacetimes. 3-The effect of a Cosmological
Constant and of Spacial Curvature on Classical and Quantum Strings. 4-Classical
splitting of Fundamental Strings. 5-The General String Evolution in constant
Curvature Spacetimes. 6-The Conformal Invariance Effects.
