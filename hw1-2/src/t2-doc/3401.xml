Semiclassical gravitation and quantization for the Bianchi type I
  universe with large anisotropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a perturbative method to evaluate the effective action of a free
scalar field propagating in the Bianchi type I spacetime with large space
anisotropy. The zeta- function regularization method is used to evaluate the
action to the second order in the Schwinger perturbative formula. As the
quantum corrections contain fourth derivative in the metric we apply the method
of iterative reduction to reduce it to the second-order form to obtain the
self-consistent solution of the semiclassical gravity theory, The reduced
Einstein equation shows that the space anisotropy, which will be smoothed out
during the evolution of universe, may play an important role in the dynamics of
early universe. We quantize the corresponding minisuperspace model to
investigate the behavior of the space anisotropy in the initial epoch. From the
wavefunction of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation we see that the probability for the
Bianchi type I spacetime with large anisotropy is less then that with a small
anisotropy.
