New Examples for Wightman Fields on a Manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  The product of two free scalar fields on a manifold is shown to be a well
defined operator valued distribution on the GNS Hilbert space of a globally
Hadamard product state. Viewed as a new field all n-point distributions exist,
giving a new example for a Wightman field on a manifold.
