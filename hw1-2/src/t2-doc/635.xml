General Gauss-Bonnet brane cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider 5-dimensional spacetimes of constant 3-dimensional spatial
curvature in the presence of a bulk cosmological constant. We find the general
solution of such a configuration in the presence of a Gauss-Bonnet term. Two
classes of non-trivial bulk solutions are found. The first class is valid only
under a fine tuning relation between the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant and the
cosmological constant of the bulk spacetime. The second class of solutions are
static and are the extensions of the AdS-Schwarzchild black holes. Hence in the
absence of a cosmological constant or if the fine tuning relation is not true,
the generalised Birkhoff's staticity theorem holds even in the presence of
Gauss-Bonnet curvature terms. We examine the consequences in brane world
cosmology obtaining the generalised Friedmann equations for a perfect fluid
3-brane and discuss how this modifies the usual scenario.
