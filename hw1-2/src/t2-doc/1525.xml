Conformal invariance in 2-dimensional discrete field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A discretized massless wave equation in two dimensions, on an appropriately
chosen square lattice, exactly reproduces the solutions of the corresponding
continuous equations. We show that the reason for this exact solution property
is the discrete analog of conformal invariance present in the model, and find
more general field theories on a two-dimensional lattice that exactly solve
their continuous limit equations. These theories describe in general
non-linearly coupled bosonic and fermionic fields and are similar to the
Wess-Zumino-Witten model.
