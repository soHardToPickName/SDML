Chen Integrals, Generalized Loops and Loop Calculus
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Chen iterated line integrals to construct a topological algebra ${\cal
A}_p$ of separating functions on the {\it Group of Loops} ${\bf L}{\cal M}_p$.
${\cal A}_p$ has an Hopf algebra structure which allows the construction of a
group structure on its spectrum. We call this topological group, the group of
generalized loops $\widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$.
  Then we develope a {\it Loop Calculus}, based on the {\it Endpoint} and {\it
Area Derivative Operators}, providing a rigorous mathematical treatment of
early heuristic ideas of Gambini, Trias and also Mandelstam, Makeenko and
Migdal. Finally we define a natural action of the "pointed" diffeomorphism
group $Diff_p({\cal M})$ on $ \widetilde {{\bf L}{\cal M}_p}$, and consider a
{\it Variational Derivative} which allows the construction of homotopy
invariants.
  This formalism is useful to construct a mathematical theory of {\it Loop
Representation} of Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity. Figures available by
request.
