Chiral supersymmetric pp-wave solutions of IIA supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe solutions of type IIA (N=2, D=10) supergravity built under the
assumption of the existence of at least one residual chiral supersymmetry.
Their geometry is of pp-wave type. Explicit parametrization of the metric and
matter field components, in terms of Killing spinors and arbitrary functions,
is provided.
