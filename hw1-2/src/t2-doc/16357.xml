Gauge Theories on Bound States of Fractional Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the N=2 super Yang Mills theory living in the world volume of a
bound state made of fractional D3/D7 branes at the orbifold R^{1,5}*R^4/ Z_2,
by using the probe technique. We also discuss the boundary action for the
system.
