Current Algebra and Bosonization in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the fermion-boson mapping in three dimensional space-time, in the
Abelian case, from the current algebra point of view. We show that in a
path-integral framework one can derive a general bosonization recipe leading,
in the bosonic language, to the correct equal-time current commutators of the
original free fermionic theory.
