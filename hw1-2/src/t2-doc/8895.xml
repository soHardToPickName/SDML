Generalized Integrability and two-dimensional Gravitation
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the construction of generalized integrable hierarchies of partial
differential equations, associated to affine Kac-Moody algebras, that include
those considered by Drinfel'd and Sokolov. These hierarchies can be used to
construct new models of 2D quantum or topological gravity, as well as new $\cal
W$-algebras.
