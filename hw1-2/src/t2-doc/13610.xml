An improved correspondence formula for AdS/CFT with multi-trace
  operators
</title>

<abstract>
  An improved correspondence formula is proposed for the calculation of
correlation functions of a conformal field theory perturbed by multi-trace
operators from the analysis of the dynamics of the dual field theory in Anti-de
Sitter space. The formula reduces to the usual AdS/CFT correspondence formula
in the case of single-trace perturbations.
