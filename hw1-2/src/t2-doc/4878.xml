Twisted sectors in three-dimensional gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Twisted sectors --solutions to the equations of motion with non-trivial
monodromies-- of three dimensional Euclidean gravity are studied. We argue that
upon quantization this new sector of the theory provides the necessary (and no
more) degrees of freedom to account for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
