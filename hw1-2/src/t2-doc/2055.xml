Absence of classical and quantum mixing
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, under mild assumptions, that classical degrees of freedom
dynamically coupled to quantum ones do not inherit their quantum fluctuations.
It is further shown that, if the assumptions are strengthen by imposing the
existence of a canonical structure, only purely classical or purely quantum
dynamics are allowed.
