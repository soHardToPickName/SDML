Non Relativistic Limit of a Model of Fermions interacting through a
  Chern-Simons Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the non relativistic limit of a Model of Fermions interacting
through a Chern-Simons Field, from a perspective that resembles the Wilson's
Renormalization Group approach, instead of the more usual approach found in
most texts of Field Theory. The solution of some difficulties, and a new
understanding of non relativistic models is given.
