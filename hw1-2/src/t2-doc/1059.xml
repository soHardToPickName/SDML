Generalized Quon Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalized quons interpolating between Bose, Fermi, para-Bose, para-Fermi,
and anyonic statistics are proposed. They follow from the R-matrix approach to
deformed associative algebras. It is proved that generalized quons have the
same main properties as quons. A new result for the number operator is
presented and some physical features of generalized quons are discussed in the
limit $|q_{ij}^{2}| \rightarrow 1$.
