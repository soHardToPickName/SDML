Lightcone Quantization of String Theory Duals of Free Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize in light cone gauge the bosonic sector of string theory on
Anti-de Sitter space in the zero curvature radius limit. We find that the
worldsheet falls apart into a theory of free partons and map the Hilbert space
of the string theory to the Hilbert space of a free scalar in light-front
description. We outline how the string worldsheet reproduces the field theory
at weak coupling.
