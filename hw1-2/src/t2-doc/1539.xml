The Three-Dimensional Noncommutative Nonlinear Sigma Model in Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the superspace formulation of the noncommutative nonlinear
supersymmetric O(N) invariant sigma-model in 2+1 dimensions. We prove that the
model is renormalizable to all orders of 1/N and explicitly verify that the
model is asymptotically free.
