Superembedding approach and generalized action in String/M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief introduction to superembedding approach (SEA) in its variant based on
the generalized action principle (GAP) for super-p-branes is given. A role of
harmonic variables for Lorentz group is stressed. A relation of the GAP with
complete superfield actions is noted. Recent applications in studying of
Dirichlet branes (super-Dp-branes) and M-branes are discussed.
