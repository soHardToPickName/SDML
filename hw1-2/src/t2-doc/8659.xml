Relativistic Wave Equation for Fields with Two Mass and Spin States
</title>

<abstract>
  I suggest wave equations for the scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and
pseudovector fields with different masses for spin zero and one states. Tensor,
matrix, and quaternion formulations of fields with two mass and spin states are
considered. This is the generalization of the Dirac-K\"ahler equation on the
case of different masses of fields with spin one and zero. The equation
matrices obtained are simple linear combinations of matrix elements in the
16-dimensional space. Spin projection operators and solutions of equations (for
spin one) in the form of matrix-dyads are obtained. The canonical quantization
of fields under consideration is studied. The anomalous interaction of the
scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and pseudovector fields with the external
electromagnetic field is considered. Three constants which characterize the
anomalous magnetic moment and quadrupole electric moment of a particle are
introduced.
