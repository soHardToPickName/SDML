Gravity in Randall-Sundrum Brane World Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out some subtleties with gauge fixings (which sometimes include the
so-called ``brane bending'' effects) typically used to compute the graviton
propagator on the Randall-Sundrum brane. In particular, the brane, which has
non-vanishing tension, explicitly breaks some part of the diffeomorphisms, so
that there are subtleties arising in going to, say, the axial gauge or the
harmonic gauge in the presence of (non-conformal) matter localized on the
brane. We therefore compute the graviton propagator in the gauge where only the
graviphoton fluctuations are set to zero (the diffeomorphisms necessary for
this gauge fixing are intact), but the graviscalar component is untouched. We
point out that in the Gaussian normal coordinates (where the graviscalar
component vanishes on the brane) the graviton propagator blows up in the
ultra-violet near the brane. In fact, the allowed gauge transformations, which
do not lead to such ultra-violet behavior of the graviton propagator, are such
that the coupling of the graviscalar to the brane matter cannot be gauged away
in the ultra-violet. Because of this, at the quantum level, where we expect
various additional terms to be generated in the brane world-volume action
including those involving the graviscalar, fine-tuning (which is independent of
that for the brane cosmological constant) is generically required to preserve
consistent coupling between bulk gravity and brane matter. We also reiterate
that in such warped backgrounds higher curvature terms in the bulk are
generically expected to delocalize gravity.
