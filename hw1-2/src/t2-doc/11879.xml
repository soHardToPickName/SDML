<title>
An approach to approximate calculations of Green functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach proposed recently by author for the calculation of Green
functions in quantum field theory and quantum mechanics is briefly reviewed.
The method is applied to nonperturbative calculations for anharmonic
oscillator, $\phi^4$-theory, quantum electrodynamics and other models.
