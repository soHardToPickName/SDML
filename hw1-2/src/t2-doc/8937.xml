Matrix Theory on Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the compactification of Matrix theory on tori with background
antisymmetric tensor field. Douglas and Hull have recently discussed how
noncommutative geometry appears on the tori. In this paper, we demonstrate the
concrete construction of this compactification of Matrix theory in a similar
way to that previously given by Taylor.
