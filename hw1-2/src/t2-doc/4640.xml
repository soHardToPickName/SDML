Exact Anomalous Dimensions for N=2 ADE SCFTs
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider four-dimensional N=2 superconformal field theories based on ADE
quiver diagrams. We use the procedure of hep-th/0206079 and compute the exact
anomalous dimensions of operators with large U(1)_R charge to all orders in
perturbation in the planar limit. The results are in agreement with the string
computation in the dual pp-wave backgrounds.
