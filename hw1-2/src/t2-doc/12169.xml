A Note on Brans-Dicke Cosmology with Axion
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Brans-Dicke model in the presence of an axion. The dynamical
equations are solved when the fields are space independent and the metric is
spatially flat. It is found that at late time the scale factor undergoes
decelerated expansion but the dilaton grows large. At early time, scale factor
and the dilaton approach constants.
