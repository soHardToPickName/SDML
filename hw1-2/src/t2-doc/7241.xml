Non-Renormalization Theorems in Non-Renormalizable Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A perturbative non-renormalization theorem is presented that applies to
general supersymmetric theories, including non-renormalizable theories in which
the $\int d^2\theta$ integrand is an arbitrary gauge-invariant function
$F(\Phi,W)$ of the chiral superfields $\Phi$ and gauge field-strength
superfields $W$, and the $\int d^4\theta$-integrand is restricted only by gauge
invariance. In the Wilsonian Lagrangian, $F(\Phi,W)$ is unrenormalized except
for the one-loop renormalization of the gauge coupling parameter, and
Fayet-Iliopoulos terms can be renormalized only by one-loop graphs, which
cancel if the sum of the U(1) charges of the chiral superfields vanishes. One
consequence of this theorem is that in non-renormalizable as well as
renormalizable theories, in the absence of Fayet-Iliopoulos terms supersymmetry
will be unbroken to all orders if the bare superpotential has a stationary
point.
