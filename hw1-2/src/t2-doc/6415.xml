On the Nonlinear Realization of the Superconformal Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The nonlinear realization of the superconformal symmetry in two dimensions is
considered. The superconformal symmetry is realized by means of dimension
$-1/2$\ Nambu-Goldstone fermion $\xi$\ and its dimension 3/2 conjugate $\eta$.
A matter coupling of these Nambu- Goldstone fermions reproduce the realization
found by Berkovits and Vafa to show the equivalence between the bosonic string
and a $N=1$\ superstring. This indicates that this equivalence is a result of
the super Higgs mechanism as a two dimensional field theory, in which the NG
fermions become unphysical.
