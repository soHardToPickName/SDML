Bose-Einstein condensation for a self-interacting theory in curved
  spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action is derived for a self-interacting theory with a finite
fixed $O(2)$ charge at finite temperature in curved spacetime. We obtain the
high temperature expansion of the effective action in the weak coupling limit.
In the relativistic temperature, we discuss about the phase transition in a
homogeneous spacetime.
