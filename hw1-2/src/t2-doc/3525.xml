BTZ black hole and quantum Hall effect in the bulk/boundary dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out an interesting analogy between the BTZ black hole and QHE
(Quantum Hall effect) in the (2+1)-dimensional bulk/boundary theories. It is
shown that the Chern-Simons/Liouville(Chern-Simons/chiral boson) is an
effective description for the BTZ black hole (QHE). Also the
IR(bulk)-UV(boundary) connection for a black hole information bound is realized
as the UV(low-lying excitations on bulk)-IR(long-range excitations on boundary)
connection in the QHE. An inflow of conformal anomaly($c=1$ central charge)
onto the timelike boundary of AdS$_3$ by the Noether current corresponds to an
inflow of chiral anomaly onto the edge of disk by the Hall current.
