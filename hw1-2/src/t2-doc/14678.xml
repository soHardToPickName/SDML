On Relativistic Brane Probes in Singular Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relativistic dynamics of brane probes in singular warped
spacetimes and establish limits for such analysis. The behavior of the
semiclassical brane probe wave functions implies that unitarity boundary
conditions can be imposed at the singularity.
