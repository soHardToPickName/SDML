Heterotic String Conformal Field Theory And A-D-E Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the behavior of the heterotic string near an A-D-E singularity
without small instantons. This problem is governed by a strongly coupled
worldsheet conformal field theory, which, by a combination of O(alpha')
corrections and worldsheet instantons, smooths out the singularities present in
the classical geometry.
