Aspects of Superembeddings
</title>

<abstract>
  Some aspects of the geometry of superembeddings and its application to
supersymmetric extended objects are discussed. In particular, the embeddings of
(3|16) and (6|16) dimensional superspaces into (11|32) dimensional superspace,
corresponding to supermembranes and superfivebranes in eleven dimensions, are
treated in some detail.
