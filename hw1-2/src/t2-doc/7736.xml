A Matrix Model Solution of Hirota Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a hermitian matrix chain representation of the general solution of
the Hirota bilinear difference equation of three variables. In the large N
limit this matrix model provides some explicit particular solutions of
continuous differential Hirota equation of three variables. A relation of this
representation to the eigenvalues of transfer matrices of 2D quantum integrable
models is discussed.
