Supersymmetric Bag Model as a Development of the Witten Superconducting
  String
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider particlelike solutions to supergravity based on the Kerr-Newman
BH solution. The BH singularity is regularized by means of a phase transition
to a new superconducting vacuum state near the core region. We show that this
phase transition can be controlled by gravity in spite of the extreme smallness
of the local gravitational field.
  Supersymmetric BPS domain wall model is suggested which can provide this
phase transition and formation the stable charged (dual) superconducting core.
