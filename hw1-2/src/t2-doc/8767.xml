Flavor ``Conservation'' and Hierarchy in TeV-scale Supersymmetric
  Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently a TeV-scale Supersymmetric Standard Model (TSSM) was proposed in
which the gauge coupling unification is as precise (at one loop) as in the
MSSM, and occurs in the TeV range. Proton stability in the TSSM is due to an
anomaly free Z_3 X Z_3 discrete gauge symmetry, which is also essential for
successfully generating neutrino masses in the desirable range. In this paper
we show that the TSSM admits anomaly free non-Abelian discrete flavor gauge
symmetries (based on a left-right product tetrahedral group) which together
with a ``vector-like'' Abelian (discrete) flavor gauge symmetry suppresses
dangerous higher dimensional operators corresponding to flavor changing neutral
currents (FCNCs) to an acceptable level. Discrete flavor gauge symmetries are
more advantageous compared with continuous flavor gauge symmetries as the
latter must be broken, which generically results in unacceptably large gauge
mediated flavor violation. In contrast, in the case of discrete flavor gauge
symmetries the only possibly dangerous sources of flavor violation either come
from the corresponding ``bulk'' flavon (that is, flavor symmetry breaking
Higgs) exchanges, or are induced by flavon VEVs. These sources of flavor
violation, however, are adequately suppressed by the above flavor gauge
symmetries for the string scale \sim 10-100 TeV
