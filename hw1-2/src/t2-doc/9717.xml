Vector Symmetries and Theta-Vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  Under very general assumptions we show that Vafa-Witten theorem on vector
symmetries in vector-like theories can be extended to some physically relevant
gauge theories with non-positive definite integration measure as QCD with a
theta-vacuum term.
