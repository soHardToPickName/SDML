Self-dual vortices in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with non-minimal
  coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We find self-dual vortex solutions in a Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with
anomalous magnetic moment. From a recently developed N=2-supersymmetric
extension, we obtain the proper Bogomol'nyi equations together with a Higgs
potential allowing both topological and non-topological phases in the theory.
