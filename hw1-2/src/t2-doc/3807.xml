Action at a distance as a full-value solution of Maxwell equations:
  basis and application of separated potential's method
</title>

<abstract>
  The inadequacy of Li\'{e}nard-Wiechert potentials is demonstrated as one of
the examples related to the inconsistency of the conventional classical
electrodynamics. The insufficiency of the Faraday-Maxwell concept to describe
the whole electromagnetic phenomena and the incompleteness of a set of
solutions of Maxwell equations are discussed and mathematically proved. Reasons
of the introduction of the so-called ``electrodynamics dualism concept"
(simultaneous coexistence of instantaneous Newton long-range and
Faraday-Maxwell short-range interactions) have been displayed. It is strictly
shown that the new concept presents itself as the direct consequence of the
complete set of Maxwell equations and makes it possible to consider classical
electrodynamics as a self-consistent and complete theory, devoid of inward
contradictions. In the framework of the new approach, all main concepts of
classical electrodynamics are reconsidered. In particular, a limited class of
motion is revealed when accelerated charges do not radiate electromagnetic
field.
