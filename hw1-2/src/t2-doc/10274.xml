Heterotic string theory interrelations
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish a symmetry map which relates two low-energy heterotic string
theories with different numbers of the Abelian gauge fields compactified from
the diverse to three dimensions on a torus. We discuss two applications of the
established symmetry: a generation of the heterotic string theory solutions
from the stationary Einstein-Maxwell fields and one non-trivial submersion of
the heterotic string theory into the bosonic one.
