Infinities within graviton scattering amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present unitarity as a method for determining the infinities present in
graviton scattering amplitudes. The infinities are a combination of IR and UV.
By understanding the soft singularities we may extract the UV infinities and
relate these to counter-terms in the effective action. As an demonstration of
this method we rederive the UV infinities present at one-loop when gravity is
coupled to matter.
