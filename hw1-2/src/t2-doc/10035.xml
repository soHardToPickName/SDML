Cos(M)ological Solutions in M- and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider solutions to the cosmological equations of motion in 11
dimensions with and without 4-form charges. We show explicitly the
correspondence between some of these solutions and known solutions in 10
dimensional string gravity. New solutions involving combinations of 4-form
charges are explored. We also speculate on the possibility of removing
curvature singularities present in 10D theories by oxidizing to 11D.
