Instantons and Monopoles in Maximal Abelian Projection of SU(2)
  Gluodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the instantons induce the abelian monopoles in the Maximal
Abelian Projection of $SU(2)$ gluodynamics. As an example we consider the case
of one instanton and the case of a set of instantons arranged along a straight
line. The abelian monopoles which are induced by instantons may play some role
in the confinement scenario.
