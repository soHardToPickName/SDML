Deformed Oscillator Algebras and Higher-Spin Gauge Interactions of
  Matter Fields in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a non-linear system of equations which describe higher-spin
gauge interactions of massive matter fields in 2+1 dimensional space-time and
explain some properties of the deformed oscillator algebra which underlies this
formulation. In particular we show that the parameter of mass $M$ of matter
fields is related to the deformation parameter in this algebra.
