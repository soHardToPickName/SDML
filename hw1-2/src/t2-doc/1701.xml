On the Picard-Fuchs Equations for Massive N=2 Seiberg-Witten Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method to obtain the Picard-Fuchs equations of effective, N=2
supersymmetric gauge theories with massive matter hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation is presented. It generalises a previously described
method to derive the Picard-Fuchs equations of both pure super Yang-Mills and
supersymmetric gauge theories with massless matter hypermultiplets. The
techniques developed are well suited to symbolic computer calculations.
