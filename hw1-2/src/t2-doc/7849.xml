On the instability of effective potential for non-abelian toroidal
  D-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the one-loop effective potential for the toroidal non-abelian
D-brane in the constant magnetic SU(2) gauge field. The study of its properties
shows that the potential is unbounded below. This fact indicates the
instability of the non-abelian D-brane in the background under consideration
like the instability of chromomagnetic vacuum in SU(2) gauge theory.
