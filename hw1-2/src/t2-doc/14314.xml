Target Space Structure of a Chiral Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The background for string propagation is obtained by a chiral gauging of the
$SL(2,R)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model. It is shown explicitly that the resulting
background fields satisfy the field equations of the three dimensional string
effective action and the target space has curvature singularity. Close
connection of our solution with the three dimensional black string is
demonstrated.
