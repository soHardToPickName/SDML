Chaos in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the classical and quantum dynamics in M(atrix) theory. Using a
simple ansatz we show that a classical trajectory exhibits a chaotic motion. We
argue that the holographic feature of M(atrix) theory is related with the
repulsive feature of energy eigenvalues in quantum chaotic system. Chaotic
dynamics in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is also discussed. We
demonstrate that after the separation of "slow" and "fast" modes there is a
singular contribution from the "slow" modes to the Hamiltonian of the "fast"
modes.
