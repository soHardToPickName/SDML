Matrix Strings, Compactification Scales and Hagedorn Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we use the Matrix Model of Strings in order to extract some
non-perturbative information on how the Hagedorn critical temperature arises
from eleven-dimensional physics. We study the thermal behavior of M and Matrix
theories on the compactification backgrounds that correspond to string models.
We obtain some information that allows us to state that the Hagedorn
temperature is not unique for all Matrix String models and we are also able to
sketch how the $S$-duality transformation works in this framework.
