Vector bundles and Lax equations on algebraic curves

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian theory of zero-curvature equations with spectral parameter on
an arbitrary compact Riemann surface is constructed. It is shown that the
equations can be seen as commuting flows of an infinite-dimensional field
generalization of the Hitchin system. The field analog of the elliptic
Calogero-Moser system is proposed. An explicit parameterization of Hitchin
system based on the Tyurin parameters for stable holomorphic vector bundles on
algebraic curves is obtained.
