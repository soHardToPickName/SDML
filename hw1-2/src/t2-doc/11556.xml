Anomalous Global Currents and Compensating Fields in the BV Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the anomalous divergence of currents associated with global
transformations in the antifield formalism, by introducing compensating fields
that gauge these transformations. We consider the explicit case of the global
axial current in QCD but the method applies to any global transformation of the
fields.
