Bloch-Wilson Hamiltonian and a Generalization of the Gell-Mann-Low
  Theorem

<abstract>
  The effective Hamiltonian introduced many years ago by Bloch and generalized
later by Wilson, appears to be the ideal starting point for Hamiltonian
perturbation theory in quantum field theory. The present contribution derives
the Bloch-Wilson Hamiltonian from a generalization of the Gell-Mann-Low
theorem, thereby enabling a diagrammatic analysis of Hamiltonian perturbation
theory in this approach.
