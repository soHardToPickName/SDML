Quantum Gravity, Cosmology, (Liouville) Strings and Lorentz Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  I review some aspects of non-critical strings in connection with
Lorentz-Invariance violating approaches to quantum gravity. I also argue how
non-critical strings may provide a unifying framework where string Cosmology
and quantum gravity may be tackled together.
