More about generalized maximally superintegrable systems of Winternitz
  type
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently proposed procedure of constructing maximally superintegrable systems
of Winternitz type is further developed and illustrated by an example of system
admitting an explicit construction of angle variables and additional integrals
of motion. A possible application of the method to Liouville system is briefly
presented.
