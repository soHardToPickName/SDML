On electrodynamics of rapidly moving sources
</title>

<abstract>
  Rapidly moving sources create pairs in the vacuum and lose energy. In
consequence of this, the velocity of a charged body cannot approach the speed
of light closer than a certain limit which depends only on the coupling
constant. The vacuum back-reaction secures the observance of the conservation
laws. A source can lose up to 50% of energy and charge because of the vacuum
instability.
