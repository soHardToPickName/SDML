Dyon electric charge and fermion fractionalization
</title>

<abstract>
  A first principles calculation of the quantum corrections to the electric
charge of a dyon in an N=2 gauge theory with arbitrary gauge group is
presented. These corrections arise from the fermion fields via the mechanism of
fermion fractionalization. For a dyon whose magnetic charge is a non-simple
co-root, the correction is a discontinuous function on the moduli space of
vacua and the discontinuities occur precisely on co-dimension one curves on
which the dyon decays. In this way, the complete spectrum of dyons at weak
coupling is found for a theory with any gauge group. It is shown how this
spectrum is consistent with the semi-classical monodromies.
