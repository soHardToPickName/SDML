Semi-Hopf Algebra and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a semi-Hopf algebra which is more general than a Hopf algebra. Then
we construct the supersymmetry algebra via the adjoint action on this semi-Hopf
algebra. As a result we have a supersymmetry theory with quantum gauge group,
i.e., quantised enveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra. For the example, we
construct the Lagrangian N=1 and N=2 supersymmetry.
