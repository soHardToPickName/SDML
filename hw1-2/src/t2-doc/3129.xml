Observing 4D Baby Universes in Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We measure the fractal structure of four dimensional simplicial quantum
gravity by identifying so-called baby universes. This allows an easy
determination of the critical exponent $\g$ connected to the entropy of
four-dimensional manifolds.
