BPS Domain Walls in Supersymmetric QCD: Higher Unitary Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the N=1 supersymmetric QCD with SU(N_c) gauge group involving
 N_f = N_c - 1 pairs of chiral matter multiplets in fundamental and
antifundamental color representations. For this theory in the framework of the
effective lagrangian approach, we solve the BPS equations for the domain walls
interpolating between different vacua. The equations always have a unique
solution for the walls interpolating between the chirally symmetric and a
chirally asymmetric vacua. For the walls interpolating between different
chirally asymmetric vacua, the equations admit two different solutions which
exist when the mass of the matter field is below some critical value m*. At m =
m*, two branches join together and, at m > m*, no BPS - saturated complex
domain walls exist.
