The boundary N=2 supersymmetric sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an action for the N=2 supersymmetric sine-Gordon model on the
half-line, which we argue is both supersymmetric and integrable. The boundary
interaction depends on three continuous boundary parameters, as well as the
bulk mass parameter.
