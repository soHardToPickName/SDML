Endomorphism Semigroups and Lightlike Translations
</title>

<abstract>
  Certain criteria are demonstrated for a spatial derivation of a von Neumann
algebra to generate a one-parameter semigroup of endomorphisms of that algebra.
These are then used to establish a converse to recent results of Borchers and
of Wiesbrock on certain one-parameter semigroups of endomorphisms of von
Neumann algebras (specifically, Type III_1 factors) that appear as lightlike
translations in the theory of algebras of local observables.
