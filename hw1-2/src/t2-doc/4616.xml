The thermal energy of a scalar field in a one-dimensional compact space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some controverted aspects of the evaluation of the thermal energy
of a scalar field in a one-dimensional compact space. The calculations are
carried out using a generalised zeta function approach.
