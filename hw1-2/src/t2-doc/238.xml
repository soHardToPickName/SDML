Super Fivebranes near the boundary of $AdS_7\times S^4$
</title>

  We determine, to the first order in the radius of Anti-de-Sitter, the
realisation of the $OSp(6,2|2)$ superconformal algebra on vector fields. We
then calculate, to this order, the superspace metric describing the background
of $AdS_7\times S^4$. The coordinates we work with are adapted to a 6+5
splitting of the eleven dimensional superspace. Finally, we deduce in a
manifestly supersymmetric form the equations governing the dynamics of the
fivebrane near the boundary of $AdS_7$.
