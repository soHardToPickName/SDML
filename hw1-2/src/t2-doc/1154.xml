<abstract>
  Some textbooks and reports claim that the Jacobian which arises in the
discussion of the Faddeev-Popov method to quantize non-Abelian gauge theories

gauge group parameters, is gauge invariant. Other references however prove the
opposite. In this brief report we present a discussion about this matter.
