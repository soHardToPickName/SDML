The three-boson bound state in the massive Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the (matrix-valued) Feynman rules of mass perturbation theory of
the massive Schwinger model for non-zero vacuum angle theta. Further, we
discuss the properties of the three-boson bound state and compute -- by a
partial resummation of the mass perturbation series -- its mass and its partial
decay widths.
