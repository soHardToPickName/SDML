Quantum Hall states on the cylinder as unitary matrix Chern-Simons
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a unitary matrix Chern-Simons model representing fractional
quantum Hall fluids of finite extent on the cylinder. A mapping between the
states of the two systems is established. Standard properties of Laughlin
theory, such as the quantization of the inverse filling fraction and of the
quasiparticle number, are reproduced by the quantum mechanics of the matrix
model. We also point out that this system is holographically described in terms
of the one-dimensional Sutherland integrable particle system.
