T-duality and Actions for Non-BPS D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We employ T-duality to restrict the tachyon dependence of effective actions
for non-BPS D-branes. For the Born-Infeld part the criteria of T-duality and
supersymmetry are satisfied by a simple extension of the D-brane Born-Infeld
action.
