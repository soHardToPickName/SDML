Black hole thermodynamics and information loss in two dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Black hole evaporation is investigated in a (1+1)-dimensional model of
quantum gravity. Quantum corrections to the black hole entropy are computed,
and the fine-grained entropy of the Hawking radiation is studied. A generalized
second law of thermodynamics is formulated, and shown to be valid under
suitable conditions. It is also shown that, in this model, a black hole can
consume an arbitrarily large amount of information.
