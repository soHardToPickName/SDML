Branes, AdS gravitons and Virasoro symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider travelling waves propagating on the anti-de Sitter (AdS)
background. It is pointed out that for any dimension d, this space of solutions
has a Virasoro symmetry with a non-zero central charge. This result is a
natural generalization to higher dimensions of the three-dimensional
Brown-Henneaux symmetry.
