The Nonperturbative Gauge Coupling of N=2 Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the topology of the quantum coupling space and the low energy
effective action on the Coulomb branch of scale invariant N=2 SU(n) gauge
theories pick out a preferred nonperturbative definition of the gauge coupling
up to non-singular holomorphic reparametrizations.
