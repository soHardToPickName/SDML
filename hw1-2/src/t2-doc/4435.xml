Relativistically covariant formulation of the canonical theory of
  classical fields II
</title>

<abstract>
  A covariant description of the canonical theory for interacting classical
fields is developed on a space-like hypersurface. An identity invariant under
the canonical transformations is obtained. The identity follows a canonical
equation in which the interaction Hamiltonian density genarates a deformation
of the space-like hypersurface. The equation just corresponds to the
Yang-Feldman equation in the Heisenberg pictures in quantum field theory.
