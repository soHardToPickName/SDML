Mass scale effects for the Sudakov form factors in theories with the
  broken gauge symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The off-shell and the on-shell Sudakov form factors in theories with broken
gauge symmetry are calculated in the double-logarithmic approximation. We have
used different infrared cut-offs, i.e. different mass scales, for virtual
photons and weak gauge bosons.
