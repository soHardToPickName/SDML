Local modes, local vacuum, local bogoljubov coefficients and the
  renormalised stress tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  Local modes and local particles are defined at any point in curved space time
as those that most resemble Minkowsky modes at that point. It is shown that the
renormalised stress tensor is the difference of energy between the physical
vacuum and that defined by these local modes.
