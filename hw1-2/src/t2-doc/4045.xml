Dilatonic p-Branes and Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a general dilatonic p-brane solution in arbitrary dimensions in
relation to the Randall-Sundrum scenario. When the p-brane is fully localized
along its transverse directions, the Kaluza-Klein zero mode of bulk graviton is
not normalizable. When the p-brane is delocalized along its transverse
directions except one, the Kaluza-Klein zero mode of bulk graviton is
normalizable if the warp factor is chosen to increase, in which case there are
singularities at finite distance away from the p-brane. Such delocalized
p-brane can be regarded as a dilatonic domain wall as seen in higher
dimensions. This unusual property of the warp factor allows one to avoid a
problem of dilatonic domain wall with decreasing warp factor that free massive
particles are repelled from the domain wall and hit singularities, since
massive particles with finite energy are trapped around delocalized p-branes
with increasing warp factor by gravitational force and can never reach the
singularities.
