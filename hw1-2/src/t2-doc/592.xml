Fractional Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A Symmetry between bosonic coordinates and some Grassmannian-type coordinates
is presented. Commuting two of these Grassmannian-type variables results in an
arbitrary phase (not just a minus sign). This symmetry is also realised at the
level of the field theory.
