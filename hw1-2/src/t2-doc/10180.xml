Extra dimensions and color confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an extension of the ordinary four dimensional Minkowski space by
introducing additional dimensions which have their own Lorentz transformation.
Particles can transform in a different way under each Lorentz group. We show
that only quark interactions are slightly modified and that color confinement
is automatic since these degrees of freedom run only in the extra dimensions.
No compactification of the extra dimensions is needed.
