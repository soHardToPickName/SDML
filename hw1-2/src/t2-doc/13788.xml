Branes from Moyal Deformation Quantization of Generalized Yang Mills
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a Moyal deformation quantization of the SO(4k) Generalized
Yang-Mills (GYM) theory action in D=4k dimensions, for spacetime independent
field configurations, in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, yields the Dirac-Nambu-Goto
p-brane actions (obtained from the conformally invariant Dolan-Tchrakian
p-brane actions after elimination of the auxiliary world volume metrics), in
the orthonormal gauge, for p+1=4k world volumes embedded in a D=4k target
spacetime background. The gauge fields/target spacetime coordinates
correspondence is required but no large N limit is necessary. The equivalence
between Moyal SDYM and Self Dual p-branes is proposed without choosing the
orthonormal gauge.
