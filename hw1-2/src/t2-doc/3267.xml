Group Theoretical Symmetries and Generalized Baecklund Transformations
  for Integrable Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a notion of symmetry for 1+1-dimensional integrable systems which
is consistent with their group theoretic description and reproduces in special
cases the known Baecklund transformation for the generalized Korteweg-deVries
hierarchies. We also apply it to the relativistic invariance of the
Leznov-Saveliev systems.
