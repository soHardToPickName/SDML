Rotating Charged Black Hole Solution in Heterotic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a solution of the classical equations of motion arising in the
low energy effective field theory for heterotic string theory. This solution
describes a black hole in four dimensions carrying mass $M$, charge $Q$ and
angular momentum $J$. The extremal limit of the solution is discussed.
