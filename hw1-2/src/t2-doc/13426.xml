Finite Size Effects in Integrable Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The study of Finite Size Effects in Quantum Field Theory allows the
extraction of precious perturbative and non-perturbative information. The use
of scaling functions can connect the particle content (scattering theory
formulation) of a QFT to its ultraviolet Conformal Field Theory content. If the
model is integrable, a method of investigation through a nonlinear integral
equation equivalent to Bethe Ansatz and deducible from a light-cone lattice
regularization is available. It allows to reconstruct the S-matrix and to
understand the locality properties in terms of Bethe root configurations,
thanks to the link to ultraviolet CFT guaranteed by the exact determination of
scaling function. This method is illustrated in practice for Sine-Gordon /
massive Thirring models, clarifying their locality structure and the issues of
equivalence between the two models. By restriction of the Sine-Gordon model it
is also possible to control the scaling functions of minimal models perturbed
