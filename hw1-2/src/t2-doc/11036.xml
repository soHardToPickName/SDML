Chern-Simons Solitons in Quantum Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  The self-dual Chern-Simons solitons under the influence of the quantum
potential are considered. The single-valuedness condition for an arbitrary
integer number $N \ge 0$ of solitons leads to quantization of Chern-Simons
coupling constant $\kappa = m {e^{2} \over g}$, and the integer strength of
quantum potential $s = 1 - m^{2}$. As we show, the Jackiw-Pi model corresponds
to the first member (m = 1) of our hierarchy of the Chern-Simons gauged
nonlinear Schr\"odinger models, admitting self-dual solitons. New type of
exponentially localized Chern-Simons solitons for the Bloch electrons near the
hyperbolic energy band boundary are found.
