Enhanced Gauge Symmetry in M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we examine some points in the moduli space of M-Theory at
which there arise enhanced gauge symmetries. In particular, we examine the
``trivial" points of enhanced gauge symmetry in the moduli space of M-Theory on
$S^{ 1 } \times S^{ 1 } / { \bf Z }_{ 2 }$ as well as the points of enhanced
gauge symmetry in the moduli space of M-Theory on $ K3 $ and those in the
moduli space of M-Theory on $T^{5}/{\bf Z}_{2} \times S^{1}$. Also, we employ
the above enhanced gauge symmetries to derive the existence of some points of
enhanced gauge symmetry in the moduli space of the Type IIA string theory.
