Lam'e Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a precise analytic test of the instanton approximation by
comparing the exact band spectrum of the periodic Lam\'e potential to the
tight-binding, instanton and WKB approximations. The instanton result gives the
correct leading behavior in the semiclassical limit, while the tight-binding
approximation does even better. WKB is off by an overall factor of
$\sqrt{e/\pi}$.
