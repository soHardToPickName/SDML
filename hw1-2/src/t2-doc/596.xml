Non-extremal fractional branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct non-extremal fractional D-brane solutions of type-II string
theory at the Z_2 orbifold point of K3. These solutions generalize known
extremal fractional-brane solutions and provide further insights into N=2
supersymmetric gauge theories and dual descriptions thereof. In particular, we
find that for these solutions the horizon radius cannot exceed the non-extremal
enhancon radius. As a consequence, we conclude that a system of non-extremal
fractional branes cannot develop into a black brane. This conclusion is in
agreement with known dual descriptions of the system.
