Massless Monopoles Via Confining Phase Superpotentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss how the structure of massless monopoles in supersymmetric theories
with a Coulomb phase can be obtained from effective superpotentials for a phase
with a confined photon. To illustrate the technique, we derive effective
superpotentials which can be used to derive the curves which describe the
Coulomb phase of $N=2$, $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with $N_f<N_c$ flavors.
