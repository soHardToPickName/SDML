Baryons And Branes In Anti de Sitter Space
</title>

<abstract>
  In the mapping from four-dimensional gauge theories to string theory in $AdS$
space, many features of gauge theory can be described by branes wrapped in
different ways on $\S^5$, $\RP^5$, or subspaces thereof. These include a
baryon vertex coupling N external charges in the fundamental representation
of SU(N), a bound state of $k$ gluons in SO(2k) gauge theory, strings coupled
to external charges in the spinor representation of the gauge group, and domain
walls across which the low energy gauge group changes.
