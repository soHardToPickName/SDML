  After reviewing how M-theory subsumes string theory, I report on some new and
interesting developments, focusing on the ``brane-world'': circumventing no-go
theorems for supersymmetric brane-worlds, complementarity of the Maldacena and
Randall-Sundrum pictures; self-tuning of the cosmological constant. I conclude
with the top ten unsolved problems.
