Brane plus Bulk Supersymmetry in Ten Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a generalized form of IIA/IIB supergravity depending on all R-R
potentials C^(p) (p=0,1,...,9) as the effective field theory of Type IIA/IIB
superstring theory. For the IIA case we explicitly break this R-R democracy to
either p<=3 or p>=5 which allows us to write a new bulk action that can be
coupled to N=1 supersymmetric brane actions.
  The case of 8-branes is studied in detail using the new bulk & brane action.
The supersymmetric negative tension branes without matter excitations can be
viewed as orientifolds in the effective action. These D8-branes and O8-planes
are fundamental in Type I' string theory. A BPS 8-brane solution is given which
satisfies the jump conditions on the wall. As an application of our results we
derive a quantization of the mass parameter and the cosmological constant in
string units.
