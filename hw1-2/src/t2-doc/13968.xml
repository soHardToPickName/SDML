Matrix Model for Yang-Mills Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a $N_c\times N_c$ matrix model with $\cN=2$ supersymmetries and
show its relation to the topological rigid string and the topological YM$_2$.
This allows to connect the latter two theories directly. Moreover the
construction leads to a new insight in the \ninfty limit. Finally a quantum
mechanical matrix theory is proposed which may describe light-cone
(light-front) dynamics of gauge fields.
