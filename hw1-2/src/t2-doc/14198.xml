Lectures on Strings, D-branes and Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lectures we review the basic ideas of perturbative and
non-perturbative string theory. On the non-perturbative side we give an
introduction to D-branes and string duality. The elementary concepts of non-BPS
branes and noncommutative gauge theories are also discussed.
