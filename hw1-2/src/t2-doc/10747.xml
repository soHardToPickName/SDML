Poisson-Lie T-Duality: the Path-Integral Derivation
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate Poisson-Lie T-duality in a path-integral manner that allows us
to analyze the quantum corrections. Using the path-integral, we rederive the
most general form of a Poisson-Lie dualizeable background and the generalized
Buscher transformation rules it has to satisfy.
