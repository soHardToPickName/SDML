On the Anomalous Magnetic Moment in Heterotic Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly compute the anomalous magnetic moment at one loop level for an
``electron'' in a 4d heterotic string theory. The anomalous magnetic moment
vanishes if the model is spacetime supersymmetric, as required by the
supersymmetric sum rules.
