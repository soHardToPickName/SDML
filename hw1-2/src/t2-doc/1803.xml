The Donaldson-Witten Invariants in Pure QCD with Order and Disorder 't
  Hooft-like Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the first-order formalism of pure four-dimensional ${\rm SU}(2)$
Yang--Mills theory with theta-term. We describe the Green functions associated
to electric and magnetic flux operators \`a la 't~Hooft by means of
gauge-invariant non-local operators. These Green functions are related to
Witten's invariants of four-manifolds.
