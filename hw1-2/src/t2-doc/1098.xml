Branes in N=2,D=4 sugra and the conformal field theory limit
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we summarise the brane solutions (instantons, black holes and
strings) in 4 dimensions when embedded in N=2 supergravity. Like in 10
dimensions these solutions are related by duality transformations (T-duality,
c-map). For the case that the graviphoton has no magnetic charge, we discuss
the conformal field theory description of the near-horizon geometry. The
decoupling of the massless modes in the matrix limit of the M-theory
compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold is discussed.
