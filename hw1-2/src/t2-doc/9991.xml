Spin on the 4-ball
</title>

<abstract>
  Using known mode properties, the functional determinant for massless
spin-half fields on the Euclidean 4-ball is calculated and shown to be
different for spectral (nonlocal) and mixed (local) boundary conditions. The
local result agrees with that from a conformal argument. Some higher-spin
results are also given.
