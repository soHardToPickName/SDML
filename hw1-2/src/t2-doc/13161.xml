Two-Dimensional String Theory, Topological Field Theories and the
  Deformed Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the $c=1$ string theory is studied from the point of view of
topological field theories. Calculations are done for arbitrary genus. A change
in the prescription is proposed, which reproduces the results of the $1/x^2$
deformed matrix model. It is proposed that the deformed matrix model is related
to a D-series Landau-Ginzburg superpotential.
