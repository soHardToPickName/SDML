Particles on AdS_{4/7} and Primary Operators on M_{2/5} Brane
  Worldvolumes
</title>

<abstract>
  1 identify a correspondence between the various spherical harmonic modes of
massless 11 dimensional fields propagating on the $AdS_{4/7}$ in an $AdS_{4/7}
\times S^{7\4}$ compactification of M theory, and the corresponding operators,
primary under the conformal group, on the world volume of $M_2,M_5$ branes.
This is achieved by matching representations of the superconformal algebra on
the two sides of the correspondence.
