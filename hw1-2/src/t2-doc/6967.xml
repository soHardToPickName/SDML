The Canonical Symmetry for Integrable Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of discrete nonlinear symmetries of integrable equations are
investigated. These symmetries are shown to be canonical transformations. On
the basis of the considered examples, it is concluded, that the densities of
the conservation laws are changed under these transformations by spatial
divergencies.
