Effects of Magnetic Fields on String Pair Creation
</title>

<abstract>
  The rate of pair production of open strings in general uniform
electromagnetic fields is calculated in various space-time dimensions. The
corrections with respect to the case of pure electric backgrounds are
displayed. In particular, a contribution in the form of a Born-Infeld action is
derived and its role in the present context emphasized
