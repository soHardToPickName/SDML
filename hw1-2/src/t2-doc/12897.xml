Nonlocal QED admits a finitely induced gauge field action

<abstract>
  The Letter reconsiders a result obtained by Chr\'etien and Peierls in 1954
within nonlocal QED in 4D [Proc. Roy. Soc. London A 223, 468]. Starting from
secondly quantized fermions subject to a nonlocal action with the kernel $[
i\not\partial_x a(x) - m b(x)]$ and gauge covariantly coupled to an external
U(1) gauge field they found that for $a = b$ the induced gauge field action
cannot be made finite irrespectively of the choice of the nonlocality $a$ $(=
b)$. But, the general case $a \neq b$ naturally to be studied admits a finitely
induced gauge field action, as the present Letter demonstrates.
