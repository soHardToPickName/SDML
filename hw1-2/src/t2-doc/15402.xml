A Remark on Non-conformal Non-supersymmetric Theories with Vanishing
  Vacuum Energy Density
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss non-conformal non-supersymmetric large N gauge theories with
vanishing vacuum energy density to all orders in perturbation theory. These
gauge theories can be obtained via a field theory limit of Type IIB D3-branes
embedded in orbifolded space-times. We also discuss gravity in this setup.
