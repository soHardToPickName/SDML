General Form of Dilaton Gravity and Nonlinear Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a gauge theory based on general nonlinear Lie algebras. The
generic form of `dilaton' gravity is derived from nonlinear Poincar{\' e}
algebra, which exhibits a gauge-theoretical origin of the non-geometric scalar
field in two-dimensional gravitation theory.
