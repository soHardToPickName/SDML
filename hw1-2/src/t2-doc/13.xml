Finite temperature correlation functions from form factors
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate proposals of how the form factor approach to compute
correlation functions at zero temperature can be extended to finite
temperature. For the two-point correlation function we conclude that the
suggestion to use the usual form factor expansion with the modification of
introducing dressing functions of various kinds is only suitable for free
theories. Dynamically interacting theories require a more severe change of the
form factor program.
