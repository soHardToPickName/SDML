The ^sl(2)+^sl(2)/^sl(2) Coset Theory as a Hamiltonian Reduction of
  ^D(2|1;\alpha)
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the coset ^sl(2)+^sl(2)/^sl(2) is a quantum Hamiltonian
reduction of the exceptional affine Lie superalgebra ^D(2|1;\alpha) and that
the corresponding W algebra is the commutant of the U_{q}D(2|1;\alpha) quantum
group.
