The Second-Order Equation from the (1/2,0)+ (0,1/2) Representation of
  the Poincare Group
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of the first principles we derive the Barut-Wilson-Fushchich
second-order equation in the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation. Then we discuss
the possibility of the description of various mass and spin states in such a
framework.
