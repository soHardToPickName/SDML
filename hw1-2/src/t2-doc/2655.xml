Collinear Asymptotic Dynamics for Massive Particles. Reggeization and
  Eikonalization
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamics of massive particles in the collinear high momentum regime is
investigated. Methods hitherto exploiting large time asymptotic Hamiltonians in
the Dirac picture for the treatment of infrared divergences are adapted to the
collinear asymptotic dynamics. The essential role of time ordering of the
dressing operators is brought out.
