Abelian Decomposition of Sp(2N) Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the previous paper, we generalized the method of Abelian decomposition to
the case of SO(N) Yang-Mills theory. This method that was proposed by Faddeev
and Niemi introduces a set of variables for describing the infrared limit of a
Yang-Mills theory. Here, we extend the decomposition method further to the
general case of four-dimensional Sp(2N) Yang-Mills theory. We find that the
Sp(2N) connection decomposes according to irreducible representations of SO(N).
