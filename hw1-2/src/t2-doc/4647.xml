Boundary terms in the AdS/CFT correspondence for spinor fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The requirement that the action be stationary for solutions of the Dirac
equations in anti-de Sitter space with a definite asymptotic behaviour is shown
to fix the boundary term (with its coefficient) that must be added to the
standard Dirac action in the AdS/CFT correspondence for spinor fields.
