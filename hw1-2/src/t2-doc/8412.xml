Matrix difference equations for the supersymmetric Lie algebra sl(2,1)
  and the `off-shell' Bethe ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the rational R-matrix of the supersymmetric sl(2,1) matrix
difference equations are solved by means of a generalization of the nested
algebraic Bethe ansatz. These solutions are shown to be of highest-weight with
respect to the underlying graded Lie algebra structure.
