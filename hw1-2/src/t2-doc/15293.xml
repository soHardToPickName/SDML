High and low temperature behavior of a quantum group fermion gas
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the simplest $SU_{q}(2)$ invariant fermionic hamiltonian and
calculate the low and high temperature behavior for the two distinct cases
$q>1$ and $q<1$. For low temperatures we find that entropy values for the Fermi
case are an upper bound for those corresponding to $q\neq 1$. At high
temperatures we find that the sign of the second virial coefficient depends on
$q$, and vanishes at $q=1.96$.
  An important consequence of this fact is that the parameter $q$ connects the
fermionic and bosonic regions, showing therefore that $SU_{q}(2)$ fermions
exhibit fractional statistics in three spatial dimensions.
