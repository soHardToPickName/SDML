Conformal Invariance in Classical Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometric generalization of first-order Lagrangian formalism is used to
analyse a conformal field theory for an arbitrary primary field. We require
that global conformal transformations are Noetherian symmetries and we prove
that the action functional can be taken strictly invariant with respect to
these transformations. In other words, there does not exists a "Chern-Simons"
type Lagrangian for a conformally invariant Lagrangian theory.
