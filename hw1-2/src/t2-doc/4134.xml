Anatomy of Two-Loop Effective Action in Noncommutative Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute, at two-loop order, one-particle-irreducible Green functions and
effective action in noncommutative $\lambda[\Phi^3]_\star$-theory for both
planar (g=0, h=3) and nonplanar (g=1, h=1) contributions. We adopt worldline
formulation of the Feynman diagrammatics so that relation to string theory
diagrammatics is made transparent in the Seiberg-Witten limit. We argue that
the resulting two-loop effective action is expressible via open Wilson lines:
one-particle-irreducible effective action is generating functional of connected
diagrams for interacting open Wilson lines.
