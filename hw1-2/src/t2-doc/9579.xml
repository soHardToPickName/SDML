3nj-symbols and D-dimensional quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The model which generalizes Ponzano and Regge $3D$ and
Carfora-Martellini-Marzuoli $4D$ euclidean quantum gravity is considered. The
euclidean Einstein-Regge action for a $D$-simplex is given in the semiclassical
limit by a gaussian integral of a suitable $3nj$-symbol.
