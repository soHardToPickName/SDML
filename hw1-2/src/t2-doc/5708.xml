Fock-Bargman Representation of the Distorted Heisenberg Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamical algebra associated to a family of Isospectral Oscillator
Hamiltonians, named {\it Distorted Heisenberg Algebra} because its dependence
on a distortion parameter $W \geq 0$, has been recently studied. The connection
of this algebra with the Hilbert space of entire functions of growth (1/2, 2)
is analized.
