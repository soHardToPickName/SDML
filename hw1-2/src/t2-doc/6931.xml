Introduction to Division Algebras, Sphere Algebras and Twistors
</title>

<abstract>
  A very basic introduction is given to the r\^oles of division algebras and
the related sphere algebras concerning the structure of space-time in the
dimensionalities $D\is 3,4,6$ and $10$, with special emphasis on twistors
transformations for light-likeness conditions and Hopf maps, together with some
outlook for particle and string theory.
