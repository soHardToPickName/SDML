Chiral Anomaly and Ginsparg-Wilson Relation on the Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate chiral anomaly on the noncommutative torus with the overlap Dirac
operator satisfying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation in arbitrary even dimensions.
Utilizing a topological argument we show that the chiral anomaly is combined
into a form of the Chern character with star products.
