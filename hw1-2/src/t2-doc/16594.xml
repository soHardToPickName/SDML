3D Gravity, Point Particles and Liouville Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper elaborates on the bulk/boundary relation between negative
cosmological constant 3D gravity and Liouville field theory (LFT). We develop
an interpretation of LFT non-normalizable states in terms of particles moving
in the bulk. This interpretation is suggested by the fact that ``heavy'' vertex
operators of LFT create conical singularities and thus should correspond to
point particles moving inside AdS. We confirm this expectation by comparing the
(semi-classical approximation to the) LFT two-point function with the
(appropriately regularized) gravity action evaluated on the corresponding
metric.
