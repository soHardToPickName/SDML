Derivatives and the Role of the Drinfel'd Twist in Noncommutative String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the derivatives which appear in the context of noncommutative
string theory. First, we identify the correct derivations to use when the
underlying structure of the theory is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra. Then we
show that this is a specific case of a more general structure utilising the
Drinfel'd twist. We go on to present reasons as to why we feel that the
low-energy effective action, when written in terms of the original commuting
coordinates, should explicitly exhibit this twisting.
