Renormalizability and Quantum Stability of the Phase Transition in Rigid
  String Coupled to Kalb-Ramond Fields I
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently we have shown that a phase transition occurs in the leading
approximation of the large N limit in rigid strings coupled to long range
Kalb-Ramond interactions. The disordered phase is essentially the
Nambu-Goto-Polyakov string theory while The ordered phase is a new theory. In
this part I letter we study the first sub-leading quantum corrections of the
free rigid string and derive the renormalization group equation. We show that
the theory is asymptotically free, thus the extrinsic curvature of the string
drops out at large distance scales in the disordered phase. In part II we
generalize the results of this letter to the interacting theory of rigid
strings with the long range Kalb-Ramond interactions. We derive the
renormalized mass gap equation and obtain the renormalized critical line. Our
main and final result is that the phase transition does indeed survive quantum
fluctuations.
