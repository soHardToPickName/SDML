Extended superconformal symmetry and Calogero-Marchioro model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the two dimensional Calogero-Marchioro Model (CMM) without the
harmonic confinement can naturally be embedded into an extended SU(1,1|2)
superconformal Hamiltonian. We study the quantum evolution of the
superconformal Hamiltonian in terms of suitable compact operators of the N=2
extended de Sitter superalgebra with central charge and discuss the pattern of
supersymmetry breaking. We also study the arbitrary D dimensional CMM having
dynamical OSp(2|2) supersymmetry and point out the relevance of this model in
the context of the low energy effective action of the dimensionally reduced
Yang-Mills theory.
