D-dimensional massless particle with extended gauge invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose the model of $D-$dimensional massless particle whose Lagrangian is
given by the $N-$th extrinsic curvature of world-line. The system has $N+1$
gauge degrees of freedom constituting $W-$like algebra; the classical
trajectories of the model are space-like curves which obey the conditions
$k_{N+a}=k_{N-a}$, $k_{2N}=0$, $a=1,...,N-1$, $N\leq[(D-2)/2]$, while the first
$N$ curvatures $k_i$ remain arbitrary. We show that the model admits consistent
formulation on the anti-De Sitter space. The solutions of the system are the
massless irreducible representations of Poincar\'e group with $N$ nonzero
helicities, which are equal to each other.
