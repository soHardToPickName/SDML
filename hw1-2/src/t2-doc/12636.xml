Solitons in Brane Worlds

<abstract>
  We study some aspects of dilatonic domain walls in relation to the idea on
the noncompact internal space. We find that the warp factor in the spacetime
metric increases as one moves away from the domain wall for all the
supersymmetric dilatonic domain wall solutions obtained from the (intersecting)
BPS branes in string theories through toroidal compactifications, unlike the
case of the Randall-Sundrum model. On the other hand, when the dilaton coupling
parameter a for the D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall takes the
values |a|<2/(D-2), the Kaluza-Klein spectrum of graviton has the same
structure as that of the Randall-Sundrum model (and the warp factor decreases
in the finite interval around the dilatonic domain wall), thereby implying the
possibility of extending the Randall-Sundrum model to the |a|<2/(D-2) case. We
construct fully localized solutions describing extreme dilatonic branes within
extreme dilatonic domain walls and the supersymmetric branes within the
supersymmetric domain walls of string theories. These solutions are valid in
any region of spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls.
