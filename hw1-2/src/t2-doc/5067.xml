Solution of the odderon problem for arbitrary conformal weights
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method is applied to solve the Baxter equation for three coupled,
noncompact spins. Due to the equivalence with the system of three reggeized
gluons, the intercept of the odderon trajectory is predicted for the first
time, as the analytic function of the two relevant parameters.
