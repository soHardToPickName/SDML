Gas of D-Branes and Hagedorn Density of BPS States
</title>

<abstract>
  We test the prediction of a hagedorn density of BPS states which carry RR
charge in type II compactifications. We find that in certain cases they
correspond to the supersymmetric ground states for a gas of identical 0-branes.
