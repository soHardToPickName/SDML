Planckian Scattering and Shock Wave Mixing in General Relativity and
  Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Point particle scattering at Planckian centre-of-mass (cm) energies and low
fixed momentum transfers, occurring due both to electromagnetic and
gravitational interactions, is surveyed, with particular emphasis on the novel
features occurring in electromagnetic charge-monopole scattering. The issue of
possible mixing of the shock waves occurring due to both kinds of interactions
is then addressed within the framework of Einsteinian general relativity and
the dilatonic extension suggested by string theory.
