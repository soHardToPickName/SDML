Supergravity with a Noninvertible Vierbein
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there is no off-shell Palatini formulation of minimal
supergravity. Nonetheless, we have been able to generalize the multiplet and
Lagrangians of this theory to the case of vanishing determinant of the
vierbein. Unfortunately, the requirement of regularity does not single out a
unique action.
