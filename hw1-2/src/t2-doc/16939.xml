Finite density and temperature in hybrid bag models

<abstract>
  We introduce the chemical potential in a system of two-flavored massless
fermions in a chiral bag by imposing boundary conditions in the Euclidean time
direction. We express the fermionic mean number in terms of a functional trace
involving the Green function of the boundary value problem, which is studied
analytically. Numerical evaluations for the fermionic number are presented.
