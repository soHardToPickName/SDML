Noncommutative Field Theory from String Theory: Two-loop Analysis
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncommutative \phi^3 field theory in six dimensions exhibits the logarithmic
UV/IR mixing at the two-loop order. We show that open string theory in the
presence of constant background NS-NS two-form field yields the same amplitude
upon taking a decoupling limit. The stretched string picture proposed on the
basis of one-loop analysis naturally generalizes to the two-loop amplitudes in
consideration. Our string theory formulation can incorporate the closed string
insertions as well as open string insertions. Furthermore, the analysis of the
world-sheet partition function and propagators can be straightforwardly
generalized to Riemann surfaces with genus zero but with an arbitrary number of
boundaries.
