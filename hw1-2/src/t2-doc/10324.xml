Supersymmetric Multiple Basin Attractors
</title>

<abstract>
  We explain that supersymmetric attractors in general have several critical
points due to the algebraic nature of the stabilization equations. We show that
the critical values of the cosmological constant of the adS_5 vacua are given
by the topological (moduli independent) formulae analogous to the entropy of
the d=5 supersymmetric black holes. We present conditions under which more than
one critical point is available (for black hole entropy as well as to the
cosmological constant) so that the system tends to its own locally stable
attractor point. We have found several families of Z_2-symmetric critical
points where the central charge has equal absolute values but opposite signs in
two attractor points. We present examples of interpolating solutions and
discuss their generic features.
