Multiple Vacua and Boundary Conditions of Schwinger-Dyson Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relationship between the boundary conditions of the
Schwinger-Dyson equations and the phase diagram of a bosonic field theory or
matrix model. In the thermodynamic limit, many boundary conditions lead to the
same solution, while other boundary conditions have no such limit. The list of
boundary conditions for which a thermodynamic limit exists depends on the
parameters of the theory. The boundary conditions of a physical solution may be
quite exotic, corresponding to path integration over various inequivalent
complex contours.
