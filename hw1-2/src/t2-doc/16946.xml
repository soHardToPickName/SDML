Gauge Fields and Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article I attempt to collect some ideas,opinions and formulae which
may be useful in solving the problem of gauge/ string / space-time
correspondence This includes the validity of D-brane representation, counting
of gauge-invariant words, relations between the null states and the Yang-Mills
equations and the discussion of the strong coupling limit of the string sigma
model. The article is based on the talk given at the "Odyssey 2001" conference.
