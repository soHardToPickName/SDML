Two-loop self-dual Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangians (II): Imaginary part and
  Borel analysis
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the structure of the imaginary part of the two-loop
Euler-Heisenberg QED effective Lagrangian for a constant self-dual background.
The novel feature of the two-loop result, compared to one-loop, is that the
prefactor of each exponential (instanton) term in the imaginary part has itself
an asymptotic expansion. We also perform a high-precision test of Borel
summation techniques applied to the weak-field expansion, and find that the
Borel dispersion relations reproduce the full prefactor of the leading
imaginary contribution.
