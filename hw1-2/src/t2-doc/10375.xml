Vortex solutions of a Maxwell-Chern-Simons field coupled to four-fermion
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the static vortex solutions of the model of Maxwell-Chern-Simons
gauge field coupled to a (2+1)-dimensional four-fermion theory. Especially, we
introduce two matter currents coupled to the gauge field minimally: the
electromagnetic current and a topological current associated with the
electromagnetic current. Unlike other Chern-Simons solitons the N-soliton
solution of this theory has binding energy and the stability of the solutions
is maintained by the charge conservation laws.
