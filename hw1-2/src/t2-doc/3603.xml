Seeking Inspiration from the Standard Model in Order to Go Beyond it
</title>

<abstract>
  We look at various features of the Standard Model with the purpose of
exploring some possibilities of how to seek physical laws beyond it, i.e. at
even smaller distances. Only parameters and structure which are not calculable
from the Standard Model is considered useful information. Ca. $90$ bits of
information contained in the system of representations in the Standard Model
are explained by four reasonable postulates. A crude estimate is that there is
of the order of $\sim 2 \times 10^2$ useful bits of unexplained information
left today. There are several signs of the fact that the Standard Model is a
low energy tail of a more fundamental theory (not yet known). However, some
worries are expressed as concerns how far the exploration of the physics beyond
the Standard Model can proceed - if we are to be inspired from these $\sim 2
\times 10^2$ bits alone.
