Einstein Brane-Worlds In 5D Gauged Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study, in the context of five dimensional N=2 gauged supergravity with
vector and hypermultiplets, curved domain wall solutions with worldvolumes
given by four dimensional Einstein manifolds. For a choice of the projection
condition on the Killing spinors of the BPS solutions, first order differential
equations governing the flow of the scalars are derived. With these equations,
we analyze the equations of motion and determine conditions under which gauged
supergravity theories may admit Einstein domain wall solutions.
