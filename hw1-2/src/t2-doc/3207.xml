Topological Disorder Operators in Three-Dimensional Conformal Field
  Theory

<abstract>
  Many abelian gauge theories in three dimensions flow to interacting conformal
field theories in the infrared. We define a new class of local operators in
these conformal field theories which are not polynomial in the fundamental
fields and create topological disorder. They can be regarded as
higher-dimensional analogues of twist and winding-state operators in free 2d
CFTs. We call them monopole operators for reasons explained in the text. The
importance of monopole operators is that in the Higgs phase, they create
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen vortices. We study properties of these operators in
three-dimensional QED using large N_f expansion. In particular, we show that
monopole operators belong to representations of the conformal group whose
primaries have dimension of order N_f. We also show that monopole operators
transform non-trivially under the flavor symmetry group, with the precise
representation depending on the value of the Chern-Simons coupling.
