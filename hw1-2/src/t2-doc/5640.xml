Gauge boson-monopole two particle bound states and duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider perturbations in the fields of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole,
dyon and point electric solutions. We find a series of bound modes where the
fields are confined to the core of the respective solutions, and these are
interpreted as bound states of a gauge boson with the respective solutions. We
discuss the spectra of these bound states of the various two particle systems
of the Yang-Mills-Higgs model in connection with the duality of Sen.
