Infinite Braided Tensor Products and 2-D quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Braided tensor products have been introduced by the author as a systematic
way of making two quantum-group-covariant systems interact in a covariant way,
and used in the theory of braided groups. Here we study infinite braided tensor
products of the quantum plane (or other constant Zamolodchikov algebra). It
turns out that such a structure precisely describes the exchange algebra in 2D
quantum gravity in the approach of Gervais. We also consider infinite braided
tensor products of quantum groups and braided groups.
