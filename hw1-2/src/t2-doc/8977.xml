Duality and Supersymmetric Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact duality in supersymmetric gauge theories leads to highly non-trivial
predictions about the moduli spaces of BPS monopole solutions. These notes
attempt to be a pedagogical review of the current status of these
investigations and are based on lectures given at the 33rd Karpacz Winter
School: Duality - Strings and Fields, February 1997.
