Static N=2 Black Holes For Quadratic Prepotentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We employ the principle of minimal central charge and study the entropy of
N=2 black holes corresponding to the most general quadratic prepotential. We
also give a static black hole solution for these models in which the scalar
moduli are non constants. Finally, we speculate on the microscopic origin for
our solution.
