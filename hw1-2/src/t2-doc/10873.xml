Ground state Correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas with
  Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study density correlation functions for an impenetrable Bose gas in a
finite box, with Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions in the ground state.
We derive the Fredholm minor determinant formulas for the correlation
functions. In the thermodynamic limit, we express the correlation functions in
terms of solutions of non-linear differential equations which were introduced
by Jimbo, Miwa, M\^ori and Sato as a generalization of the fifth Painlev\'e
equations.
