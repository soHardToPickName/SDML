WZW models of general simple groups
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a WZW model corresponding to a general simple group
possesses in general different quantisations which are parametrised by
$Hom(\pi_1(G),Hom(\pi_1(G),U(1)))$. The quantum theories are generically
neither monodromy nor modular invariant, but all the modular invariant theories
of Felder et.al. are contained among them.
 A formula for the transformation of the Sugawara expression for $L_0$ under
conjugation with respect to non-contractible loops in $LG$ is derived. This
formula is then used to analyse the monodromy properties of the various
quantisations. It turns out that for $\pi_1(G)\cong \Zop_N$, with $N$ even,
there are $2$ monodromy invariant theories, one of which is modular invariant,
and for $\pi_1(G)\cong \Zop_2\times\Zop_2$ there are $8$ monodromy invariant
theories, two of which are modular invariant. A few specific examples are
worked out in detail to illustrate the results.
