Two-Loop Effective Action for Theories with Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of a new approach proposed in our previous work we develope a
formalism for calculating of the effective action for some models containing
fermion fields. This method allows us to calculate the fermionic part of the
effective action (up to two-loop level) properly. The two-loop contribution to
the effective potential for the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is calculated and is
shown to vanish.
