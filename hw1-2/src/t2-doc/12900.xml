The Axial Anomaly Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider theories with gauged chiral fermions in which there are abelian
anomalies, and no nonabelian anomalies (but there may be nonabelian gauge
fields present). We construct an associated theory that is gauge-invariant,
renormalizable, and with the same particle content, by adding a finite number
of terms to the action. Alternatively one can view the new theory as arising
from the original theory by using another regularization, one that is
gauge-invariant. The situation is reminiscent of the mechanism of adding
Fadeev-Popov ghosts to an unsatisfactory gauge theory, to arrive at the usual
quantization procedure. The models developed herein are much like the abelian
Wess-Zumino model (an abelian effective theory with a Wess-Zumino counterterm),
but unlike the W-Z model are renormalizable!
  Details of the approach are worked out explicitly for the special case of a
single massless Dirac fermion, for which we couple one abelian gauge field to
the vector current and another abelian gauge field to the axial current.
