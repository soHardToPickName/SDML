Supersymmetry and Bogomol'nyi equations in the Abelian Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=2 supersymmetric extension of the 2+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs model
is discussed. By analysing the resulting supercharge algebra, the connection
between supersymmetry and Bogomol'nyi equations is clarified. Analogous results
are presented when the model is considered in 2-dimensional (Euclidean) space.
