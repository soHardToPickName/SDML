The nonminimal scalar multiplet coupled to supersymmetric Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the coupling of nonminimal scalar multiplets to supersymmetric
Yang-Mills in four dimensions and compute the one-loop contribution to the
low-energy effective action in the abelian sector. We show that the resulting
theory realizes the dual version of the corresponding one from N=2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills.
