Conformal Supergravity from the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  Construction of a five dimensional conformal supergravity (D=5 CSG) is
attempted by applying the AdS/CFT correspondence to the F(4) AdS supergravity
in six dimensions. As a first step, local transformation laws of D=5 CSG have
been established, from which the Weyl weights of the various fields in D=5 can
be predicted.
