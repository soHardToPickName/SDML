Eternal Black Holes in AdS
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a dual non-perturbative description for maximally extended
Schwarzschild Anti-de-Sitter spacetimes. The description involves two copies of
the conformal field theory associated to the AdS spacetime and an initial
entangled state. In this context we also discuss a version of the information
loss paradox and its resolution.
