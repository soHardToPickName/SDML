Supersymmetric Field Theory from Supermatrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the continuum limit of one-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric matrix
models can be described by a two-dimensional interacting field theory of a
massless boson and two chiral fermions. We interpret this field theory as a
two-dimensional N=1 supersymmetric theory of two chiral superfields, in which
one of the chiral superfields has a non-trivial vacuum expectation value.
