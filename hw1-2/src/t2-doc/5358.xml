Quantum Nucleation of Vortex String Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate quantum nucleation of vortex string loops in the relativistic
quantum field theory of a complex scalar field by using the Euclidean path
integral. Our initial metastable homogeneous field dominated by the $O(3)$
symmetric bounce solution. The nucleation rate and the critical vortex loop
size are obtained approximately. Gradually the initial current will be reduced
to zero as the induced current inside vortex loops is opposite to the initial
current. We also discuss a similar process in Maxwell-Higgs systems and
possible physical implications.
