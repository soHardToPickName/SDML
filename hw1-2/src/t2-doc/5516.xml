Dyon-Skyrmion Lumps
</title>

<abstract>
  We make a numerical study of the classical solutions of the combined system
consisting of the Georgi-Glashow model and the SO(3) gauged Skyrme model. Both
monopole-Skyrmion and dyon-Skyrmion solutions are found. A new bifurcation is
shown to occur in the gauged Skyrmion solution sector.
