Planckian Vertices on High Genus Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a method to compute leading contribution at Planckian energies for
superstring scattering amplitudes of any genus. In particular we test the
method at one-loop level by comparison with previous result for the Regge
trajectory renormalization. Modular invariance of these asymptotic terms are
also discussed.
