Degeneration of the Elliptic Algebra $A_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ and Form
  Factors in the sine-Gordon Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the work with Jimbo and Miwa, we introduce a certain degeneration
of the elliptic algebra $A_{q,p}(\widehat{sl_2})$ and its boson realization. We
investigate its rational limit. The limit is the central extension of the
Yangian double DY(sl_2) at level one. We give a new boson realization of it.
Based on these algebras, we reformulate the Smirnov's form factor bootstrap
approach to the sine-Gordon theory and the SU(2) invariant Thirring model. A
conjectural integral formula for form factor in the sine-Gordon theory is
derived.
