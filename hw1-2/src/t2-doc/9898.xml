Is particle creation by the gravitational field consistent with energy
  conservation?
</title>

<abstract>
  If particle creation is described by a Bogoliubov transformation, then, in
the Heisenberg picture, the raising and lowering operators are time dependent.
On the other hand, this time dependence is not consistent with field equations
and the conservation of the stress-energy tensor. Possible physical
interpretations and resolutions of this inconsistency are discussed.
