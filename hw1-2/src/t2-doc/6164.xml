Holography and (1+1)-dimension non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  I generalize classical gravity/quantum gauge theory duality in AdS/CFT
correspondence to (1+1)-dimensional non-relativistic quantum mechanical system.
It is shown that (1+1)-dimensional non-relativistic quantum mechanical system
can be reproduced from holographic projection of (2+1)-dimension classical
gravity at semiclassical limit. In this explanation every quantum path in
2-dimension corresponds to a classical path of 3-dimension gravity under
definite holographic projection. I consider free particle and harmonic
oscillator as two examples and find their dual gravity description.
