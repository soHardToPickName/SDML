New Action Principle for Classical Particle Trajectories in Spaces with
  Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  To comply with recent developments of path integrals in spaces with curvature
and torsion we find the correct variational principle for the classical
trajectories. Although the action depends only on the length, the trajectories
are {\em autoparallels} rather than geodesics due to the effects of a new
torsion force.
