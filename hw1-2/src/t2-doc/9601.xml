Brane cosmology: an introduction
</title>

<abstract>
  These notes give an introductory review on brane cosmology. This subject
deals with the cosmological behaviour of a brane-universe, i.e. a
three-dimensional space, where ordinary matter is confined, embedded in a
higher dimensional spacetime. In the tractable case of a five-dimensional bulk
spacetime, the brane (modified) Friedmann equation is discussed in detail, and
various other aspects are presented, such as cosmological perturbations, bulk
scalar fields and systems with several branes.
