Exact Scale Invariance of the BF-Yang-Mills Theory in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The ``extended'' BF-Yang-Mills theory in 3 dimensions, which contains a
minimally coupled scalar field, is shown to be ultraviolet finite. It obeys a
trivial Callan-Symanzik equation, with all beta-functions and anomalous
dimensions vanishing. The proof is based on an anomaly-free trace identity
valid to all orders of perturbation theory.
