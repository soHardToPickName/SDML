Spectral determinants for Schroedinger equation and Q-operators of
  Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Relation between the vacuum eigenvalues of CFT Q-operators and spectral
determinants of one-dimensional Schroedinger operator with homogeneous
potential, recently conjectured by Dorey and Tateo for special value of
Virasoro vacuum parameter p, is proven to hold, with suitable modification of
the Schroedinger operator, for all values of p.
