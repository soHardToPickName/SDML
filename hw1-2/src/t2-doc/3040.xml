Generalized WDVV equations for F4 pure N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An associative algebra of holomorphic differential forms is constructed
associated with pure N=2 Super-Yang-Mills theory for the Lie algebra F4.
Existence and associativity of this algebra, combined with the general
arguments in the work of Marshakov, Mironov and Morozov, proves that the
prepotential of this theory satisfies the generalized WDVV system.
