Radiative corrections to the Chern-Simons term at finite temperature in
  the noncommutative Chern-Simons-Higgs model

<abstract>
  The one-loop radiative correction to the Chern-Simons coefficient is computed
in noncommutative Chern-Simons-Higgs model at zero and at finite temperature.
At high temperature, we show that the static limit of this correction is
proportional to $TlogT$, in contrast with the commutative case, where it goes
like $T$. Our results are analytic functions of the noncommutative parameter.
