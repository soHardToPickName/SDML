On the local symmetries of gravity and supergravity models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present here a detailed analysis of the local symmetries of supergravity
in an arbitrary dimension D, both in the component and superfield approaches,
using a field-space democracy point of view. As an application, we discuss
briefly how a complete description of the local gauge symmetries clarifies the
properties of the supergravity-superbrane coupled system in the standard
background superfield approximation for supergravity.
