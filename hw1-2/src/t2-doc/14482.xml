Can one restore Lorentz invariance in quantum N=2 string?
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quantum N=2 string embedded into the N=4 topological framework
from the perspective of the old covariant quantisation. Making use of the
causality and cyclic symmetry of tree amplitudes we argue that no Lorentz
covariant boson emission vertex can be constructed within the N=4 topological
formalism.
