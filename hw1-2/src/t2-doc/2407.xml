Non Parallels Electric and Magnetic Fields in a F.R.W. Cosmology.
  Classical and Quantum Gravitational Implications
</title>

<abstract>
  At first, we discuss parallels electric and magnetic fields solutions in a
gravitational background. Then, considering eletromagnetic and gravitational
waves symmetries we show a particular solution for stationary gravitational
waves. Finally we consider gravitation as a gauge theory (effective
gravitational theory), evaluate the propagators of the model, analyze the
corresponding quantum excitations and verify (confirm) the tree-level unitarity
at many places of the model.
