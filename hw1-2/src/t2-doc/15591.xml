Duality Symmetries in N=2 Heterotic Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the derivation and the basic properties of the perturbative
prepotential in N=2 compactifications of the heterotic superstring. We discuss
the structure of the perturbative monodromy group and the embedding of rigidly
supersymmetric monodromies associated with enhanced gauge groups, at both
perturbative and non-perturbative level.
