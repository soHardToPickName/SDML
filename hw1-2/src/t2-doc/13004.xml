Exact scheme independence at one loop
</title>

<abstract>
  The requirement that the quantum partition function be invariant under a
renormalization group transformation results in a wide class of exact
renormalization group equations, differing in the form of the kernel. Physical
quantities should not be sensitive to the particular choice of the kernel. We
demonstrate this scheme independence in four dimensional scalar field theory by
showing that, even with a general kernel, the one-loop beta function may be
expressed only in terms of the effective action vertices, and thus, under very
general conditions, the universal result is recovered.
