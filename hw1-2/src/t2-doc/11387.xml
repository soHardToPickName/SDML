Form Factors in $D_n^{(1)}$ Affine Toda Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive closed recursion equations for the symmetric polynomials occuring
in the form factors of $D_n^{(1)}$ affine Toda field theories. These equations
follow from kinematical- and bound state residue equations for the full form
factor. We also discuss the equations arising from second and third order
forward channel poles of the S-matrix. The highly symmetric case of $D_4^{(1)}$
form factors is treated in detail. We calculate explicitly cases with a few
particles involved.
