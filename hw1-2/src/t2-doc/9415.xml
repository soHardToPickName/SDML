Q-Boson Representation of the Quantum Matrix Algebra $M_q(3)$
</title>

<abstract>
  {Although q-oscillators have been used extensively for realization of quantum
universal enveloping algebras,such realization do not exist for quantum matrix
algebras ( deformation of the algebra of functions on the group ). In this
paper we first construct an infinite dimensional representation of the quantum
matrix algebra $ M_q ( 3 ) $(the coordinate ring of $ GL_q (3)) $ and then use
this representation to realize $ GL_q ( 3 ) $ by q-bosons.}
