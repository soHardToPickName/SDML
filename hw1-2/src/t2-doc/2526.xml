Perturbative test of exact vacuum expectation values of local fields in
  affine Toda theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Vacuum expectation values of local fields for all dual pairs of non-simply
laced affine Toda field theories recently proposed are checked against
perturbative analysis. The computations based on Feynman diagram expansion are
performed upto two-loops. Agreement is obtained.
