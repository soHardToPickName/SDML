CPT violation: mechanism and phenomenology
</title>

<abstract>
  A new mechanism for T and CPT violation is reviewed, which relies on chiral
fermions, gauge interactions and nontrivial spacetime topology. Also discussed
are the possible effects on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in vacuo,
in particular for the cosmic microwave background radiation.
