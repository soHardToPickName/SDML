Vortex Line Nucleation of First-Order Transition U(1)-Symmetric Field
  Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in field systems with U(1)-symmetry, first-order transitions are
nucleated by vortex lines, not bubbles, thus calling for a reinvestigation of
the Kibble mechanism for the phase transition of the early universe.
