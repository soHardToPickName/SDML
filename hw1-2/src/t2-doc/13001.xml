Coupling of branes and normalization of effective actions in
  string/M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss issues involving p(D)- brane charge quantization and the
normalization of effective actions, in string/M-theory. We also construct the
action of (the bosonic sector of) eleven dimensional supergravity in the
presence of two- and five- branes and discuss (perturbative) anomaly
cancellation.
