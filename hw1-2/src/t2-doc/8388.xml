Open String Creation by S-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  An sp-brane can be viewed as the creation and decay of an unstable
D(p+1)-brane. It is argued that the decaying half of an sp-brane can be
described by a variant of boundary Liouville theory. The pair creation of open
strings by a decaying s-brane is studied in the minisuperspace approximation to
the Liouville theory. In this approximation a Hagedorn-like divergence is found
in the pair creation rate, suggesting the s-brane energy is rapidly transferred
into closed string radiation.
