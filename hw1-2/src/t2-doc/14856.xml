The four-fermion interaction in D=2,3,4: a nonperturbative treatment
</title>

<abstract>
  A new nonperturbative approach is used to investigate the Gross-Neveu model
of four fermion interaction in the space-time dimensions 2, 3 and 4, the number
$N$ of inner degrees of freedom being a fixed integer. The spontaneous symmetry
breaking is shown to exist in $D=2,3$ and the running coupling constant is
calculated. The four dimensional theory seems to be trivial.
