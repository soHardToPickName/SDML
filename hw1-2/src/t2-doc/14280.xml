Boundary states in boundary logarithmic CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  There exist logarithmic CFTs(LCFTs) such as the $c_{p,1}$ models. It is also
well known that it generally contains Jordan cell structure. In this paper, we
obtain the boundary Ishibashi state for a rank-2 Jordan cell structure and,
with these states in $c=-2$ rational LCFT, we derive boundary states in the
closed string picture, which correspond to boundary conditions in the open
string picture. We also discuss the Verlinde formula for LCFT and possible
applications to string theory.
