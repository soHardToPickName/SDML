Global Topology and Local Violation of Discrete Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Cosmological models that are locally consistent with general relativity and
the standard model in which an object transported around the universe undergoes
P, C and CP transformations, are constructed. This leads to generalization of
the gauge fields that describe electro-weak and strong interactions by
enlarging the gauge groups to include anti-unitary transformations. Gedanken
experiments show that if all interactions obey Einstein causality then P, C and
CP cannot be violated in these models. But another model, which would violate
charge superselection rule even for an isolated system, is allowed. It is
suggested that the fundamental physical laws must have these discrete
symmetries which are broken spontaneously, or they must be non causal.
