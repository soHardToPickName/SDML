Decomposition of Representations of CAR Induced by Bogoliubov
  Endomorphisms

<abstract>
  In a Fock representation, a non-surjective Bogoliubov transformation of CAR
leads to a reducible representation. For the case that the corresponding
Bogoliubov operator has finite corank, the decomposition into irreducible
subrepresentations is clarified. In particular, it turns out that the number of
appearing subrepresentations is completely determined by the corank.
