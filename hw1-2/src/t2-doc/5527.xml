Perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of pure N=1 super Yang-Mills
  theory from wrapped branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The Maldacena-Nunez solution is generalized to include a number of
integration constants, one of which controls the resolution of the singularity
of the wrapped D5-brane background. Some features of the dual pure N=1 super
Yang-Mills (SYM) theory are calculated, amongst which the gluino condensate,
the beta function of the gauge coupling and a brane probe potential, which is
related to the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective potential. Each integration
constant has a precise meaning in the dual SYM theory, e.g., the amount of
non-perturbative SYM physics captured by the gravity configuration is described
by the singularity resolution parameter.
