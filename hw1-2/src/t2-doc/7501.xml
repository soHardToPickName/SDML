Gauge strata and particle generations
</title>

<abstract>
  Phenomenological evidence suggests the existence of non-trivial background
fields in the QCD vacuum. On the other hand SU(3) gauge theory possessses three
different classes of both non-generic and non-trivial strata that may be used
as classical backgrounds. It is suggested that this three-fold multiplicity of
non-trivial vacua may be related to the existence of particle generations,
which would then find an explanation in the framework of the standard model.
