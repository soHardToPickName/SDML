Gauge Symmetries and Amplitudes in N=2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Picture changed operators are discussed in $N=2$ strings with space-time
signature $(2,2)$. A gauge symmetry algebra is derived in a background of torus
space-time $T^{2,2}$ and its simple representation on the picture changed
operators is given. Simple Ward identities associated with the gauge algebra
and their consequences for three and four point amplitudes of arbitrary loops
are also discussed.
