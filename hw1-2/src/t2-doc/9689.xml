String Junction Transitions in the Moduli Space of N=2 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  The string theory description of BPS states in D-brane world-volume field
theories may undergo transitions from open strings to string webs, as well as
between different string webs, as one moves in the field theory moduli space.
These transitions are driven by the string creation phenomenon. We demonstrate
such transitions in the D3-brane realization of N=2 SU(2) Super-Yang-Mills
theory.
