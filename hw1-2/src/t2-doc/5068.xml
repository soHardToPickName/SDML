Geometry of theory space and RG flows
</title>

<abstract>
  The space of couplings of a given theory is the arena of interest in this
article. Equipped with a metric ansatz akin to the Fisher information matrix in
the space of parameters in statistics (similar metrics in physics are the
Zamolodchikov metric or the O'Connor--Stephens metric) we investigate the
geometry of theory space through a study of specific examples. We then look
into renormalisation group flows in theory space and make an attempt to
characterise such flows via its isotropic expansion, rotation and shear.
Consequences arising from the evolution equation for the isotropic expansion
are discussed. We conclude by pointing out generalisations and pose some open
questions.
