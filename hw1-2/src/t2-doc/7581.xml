  theory

  The R-matrix of the U_q(d_4(3)) algebra is constructed in the 8-dimensional
fundamental representation. Using this result an exact S-matrix is conjectured
for the imaginary coupled g_2(1) affine Toda field theory, the structure of
which is found to be very similar to the previously investigated S-matrix of
d_4(3) Toda theory. It is shown that this S-matrix is consistent with the
results for the case of real coupling using the breather-particle
correspondence. For q a root of unity it is argued that the theory can be
restricted to yield Phi(11|12) perturbations of WA_2 minimal models.
