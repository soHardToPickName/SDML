Solitons with integer fermion number
</title>

<abstract>
  Necessary and sufficient conditions are found for any object in $3+1$
dimensions to have integer rather than fractional fermion number. Nontrivial
examples include the Jackiw-Rebbi monopole and the already well studied
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger soliton, both displaying integer multiples of elementary
charges in combinations that normally are forbidden.
