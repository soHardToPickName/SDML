Near Horizon Geometry of Rotating Black Holes in Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We interpret the general rotating black holes in five dimensions as rotating
black strings in six dimensions. In the near horizon limit the geometry is
locally AdS_3 x S_3, as in the nonrotating case. However, the global structure
couples the AdS_3 and the S_3, giving angular velocity to the S_3. The
asymptotic geometry is exploited to count the microstates and recover the
precise value of the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy, with rotation taken properly
into account. We discuss the perturbation spectrum of the rotating black hole,
and its relation to the underlying conformal field theory.
