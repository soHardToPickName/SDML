On the nullification of threshold amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  The nullification of threshold amplitudes is considered within the
conventional framework of quantum field theory. The relevant Ward identities
for the reduced theory are derived both on path-integral and diagrammatic
levels. They are then used to prove the vanishing of tree-graph threshold
amplitudes.
