Manifest supersymmetry and the ADHM construction of instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the (0,4) superspace version of Witten's sigma model construction
for ADHM instantons. We use the harmonic superspace formalism, which exploits
the three complex structures common to both (0,4) supersymmetry and self-dual
Yang-Mills theory. A novel feature of the superspace formulation is the
manifest interplay between the ADHM construction and its twistor counterpart.
