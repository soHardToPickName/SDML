Effective lagrangians for QCD at high density
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe low energy physics in the CFL and LOFF phases by means of
effective lagrangians. In the CFL case we present also how to derive
expressions for the parameters appearing in the lagrangian via weak coupling
calculations taking advantage of the dimensional reduction of fermion physics
around the Fermi surface. The Goldstone boson of the LOFF phase turns out to be
a phonon satisfying an anisotropic dispersion relation.
