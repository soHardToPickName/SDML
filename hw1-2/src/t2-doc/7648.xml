Exact Monodromy Group of N=2 Heterotic Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe an $N=2$ heterotic superstring model of rank-3 which is dual to
the type-II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold with Betti numbers
$b_{1,1}=2$ and $b_{1,2}=86$. We show that the exact duality symmetry found
from the type II realization contains the perturbative duality group of the
heterotic model, as well as the exact quantum monodromies of the rigid $SU(2)$
super-Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, it contains a non-perturbative monodromy
which is stringy in origin and corresponds roughly to an exchange of the string
coupling with the compactification radius.
