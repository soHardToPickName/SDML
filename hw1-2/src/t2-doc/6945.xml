Tachyon Condensation and Open String Field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform canonical quantization of the open string on a unstable D-brane in
the background of the tachyon condensation. Evaluating the Polyakov
path-integral on a stripe, we obtain the field theoretical propagator in the
open string theory. As the condensation occurs the string field theory is
continuously deformed. At the infrared fixed point of the condensation, the
open string field on the unstable D-brane transmutes to that on the lower
dimensional D-brane with the correct D-brane tension.
