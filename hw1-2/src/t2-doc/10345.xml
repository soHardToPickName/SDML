Anomalies in String Theory with D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze global anomalies for elementary Type II strings in the presence of
D-branes. Global anomaly cancellation gives a restriction on the D-brane
topology. This restriction makes possible the interpretation of D-brane charge
as an element of K-theory.
