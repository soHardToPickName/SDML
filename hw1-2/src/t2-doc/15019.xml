Do classical configurations produce Confinement?
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that certain classical SU(2) pure gauge configurations give rise to a
non-zero string tension. We then investigate cooled configurations generated by
Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice and find similar properties. We infer
evidence in favour of a classical model of Confinement.
