Calogero-Sutherland Particles as Quasisemions
</title>

<abstract>
  The ultraviolet structure of the Calogero-Sutherland models is examined, and,
in particular, semions result to have special properties. An analogy with
ultraviolet structures known in anyon quantum mechanics is drawn, and it is
used to suggest possible physical consequences of the observed semionic
properties.
