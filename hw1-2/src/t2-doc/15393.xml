Semiclassical Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the properties of a non-abelian gauge theory subjected to a gauge
invariant constraint given by the classical equations of motion. The constraint
is not imposed by hand, but appears naturally when we study a particular type
of local gauge transformations. In this way, all standard techniques to treat
gauge theories are available. We will show that this theory lives at one-loop.
Also this model retains some quantum characteristic of the usual non-abelian
gauge theories as asymptotic freedom.
