Entropy for extremal Reissner- Nordstr\o m black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We reinterpret recent work on extremal Reissner- Nordstr\o m black holes to
argue that the mass is a measure of the gravitational entropy. We also find
that the entropy of scalar fields in this background has a stronger divergence
than usual.
