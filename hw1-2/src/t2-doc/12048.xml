On Scherk-Schwarz mechanism in gauged five-dimensional supergravity and
  on its relation to bigravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the relation between the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and flipped
gauged brane-bulk supergravities in five dimensions. We discuss the form of
supersymmetry violating Scherk-Schwarz terms in pure supergravity and in
supergravity coupled to matter. We point out that brane-induced supersymmetry
breakdown in 5d Horava-Witten model is not of the Scherk-Schwarz type. We
discuss in detail flipped super-bigravity, which is the locally supersymmetric
extension of the (++) bigravity.
