The Quantum Liouville Equation for the Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the von Neumann equation, we construct the quantum evolution
equation for the effective action for systems in mixed states. This allows us
to find the hierarchy of equations which describe the time evolution of equal
time correlators. The method is applied explicitly to a scalar theory with
quartic self-interaction.
