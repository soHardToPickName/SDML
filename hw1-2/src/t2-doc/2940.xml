Cosmological constant problems and their solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  There are now two cosmological constant problems: (i) why the vacuum energy
is so small and (ii) why it comes to dominate at about the epoch of galaxy
formation. Anthropic selection appears to be the only approach that can
naturally resolve both problems. The challenge presented by this approach is
that it requires scalar fields with extremely flat potentials or four-form
fields coupled to branes with an extremely small charge. Some recent
suggestions are reviewed on how such features can arise in particle physics
models.
