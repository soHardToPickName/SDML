U-Duality and BPS Spectrum of Super Yang-Mills Theory and M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the BPS spectrum of Super-Yang-Mills theory on $T^d\times
\R$, which fits into representations of the U-duality group for M-theory
compactified on $T^{d}$, in accordance with the matrix-theory conjecture, in
fact fits into representations of the U-duality group for M-theory on
$T^{d+1}$, the extra dualities realised as generalised Nahm transformations.
The spectrum of BPS M-branes is analysed, new branes are discussed and matrix
theory applications described.
