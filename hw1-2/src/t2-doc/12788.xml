On a New Universal Class of Phase Transitions and Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the possible phase transitions between (2+1)-dimensional abelian
Chern-Simons theories. We show that they may be described by non-unitary
rational conformal field theories with c_eff = 1. As an example we choose the
fractional quantum Hall effect and derive all its main features from the
discrete fractal structure of the moduli space of these non-unitary transition
conforma lfield theories and some large scale principles. Rationality of these
theories is intimately related to the modular group yielding sever conditions
on the possible phase transitions. This gives a natural explanation for both,
the values and the widths, of the observed fractional Hall plateaux.
