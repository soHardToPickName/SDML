Split Dimensional Regularization for the Temporal Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  A split dimensional regularization, which was introduced for the Coulomb
gauge by Leibbrandt and Williams, is used to regularize the spurious
singularities of Yang-Mills theory in the temporal gauge. Typical one-loop
split dimensionally regularized temporal gauge integrals, and hence the
renormalization structure of the theory are shown to be the same as those
calculated with some nonprincipal-value prescriptions.
