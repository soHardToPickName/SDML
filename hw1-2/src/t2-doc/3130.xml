A Brane World Solution to the Cosmological Constant Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model with two parallel (positive tension) 3-branes separated
by a distance $L$ in 5-dimensional spacetime. If the interbrane space is
anti-deSitter, or is not precisely anti-deSitter but contains no event
horizons, the effective 4-dimensional cosmological constant seen by observers
on one of the branes (chosen to be the visible brane) becomes exponentially
small as $L$ grows large.
