Energy-Momentum Tensor Improvements in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some aspects of the two-dimensional scalar field, considering
particularly the action for the conformal anomaly as an ``improved''
gravitational coupling, and the possibility of introducing a dual coupling,
which provides a ``chiral'' energy-momentum tensor improvement.
