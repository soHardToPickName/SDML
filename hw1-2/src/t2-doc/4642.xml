Form Factors, Thermal States and Modular Structures
</title>

<abstract>
  Form factor sequences of an integrable QFT can be defined axiomatically as
solutions of a system of recursive functional equations, known as ``form factor
equations''. We show that their solution can be replaced with the study of the
representation theory of a novel algebra F(S). It is associated with a given
two-particle S-matrix and has the following features: (i) It contains a double
TTS algebra as a subalgebra. (ii) Form factors arise as thermal vector states
over F(S) of temperature 1/2\pi. The thermal ground states are in
correspondence to the local operators of the QFT. (iii) The underlying `finite
temperature structure' is indirectly related to the ``Unruh effect'' in Rindler
spacetime. In F(S) it is manifest through modular structures (j,\delta) in the
sense of algebraic QFT, which can be implemented explicitly in terms of the TTS
generators.
