Perturbative Quantum Field Theory in the String-Inspired Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the status and present range of applications of the
``string-inspired'' approach to perturbative quantum field theory. This
formalism offers the possibility of computing effective actions and S-matrix
elements in a way which is similar in spirit to string perturbation theory, and
bypasses much of the apparatus of standard second-quantized field theory. Its
development was initiated by Bern and Kosower, originally with the aim of
simplifying the calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum chromodynamics
and quantum gravity. We give a short account of the original derivation of the
Bern-Kosower rules from string theory. Strassler's alternative approach in
terms of first-quantized particle path integrals is then used to generalize the
formalism to more general field theories, and, in the abelian case, also to
higher loop orders. A considerable number of sample calculations are presented
in detail, with an emphasis on quantum electrodynamics.
