Exceptional String: Instanton Expansions and Seiberg-Witten Curve
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate instanton expansions of partition functions of several toric
E-string models using local mirror symmetry and elliptic modular forms. We also
develop a method to obtain the Seiberg--Witten curve of E-string with arbitrary
Wilson lines with the help of elliptic functions.
