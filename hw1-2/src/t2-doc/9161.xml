D-brane Interactions, World-sheet Parity and Anti-Symmetric Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  Using world-sheet parity we show that mixed D and N components of D-strings
are dual to the anti-symmetric $B_{\mu\nu}$ field. The contribution of the
latter is responsible for the reduction and even removal of all the
interactions between two dissimilar D-branes.
