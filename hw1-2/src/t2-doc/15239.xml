Generalized canonical quantization of bosonic string model in massive
  background fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A method of constructing a canonical gauge invariant quantum formulation for
a non-gauge classical theory depending on a set of parameters is advanced and
then applied to the theory of closed bosonic string interacting with massive
background fields. It is shown that within the proposed formulation the correct
linear equations of motion for background fields arise.
