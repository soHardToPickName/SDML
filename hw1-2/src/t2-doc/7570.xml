Expectation values of local fields in Bullough-Dodd model and integrable
  perturbed conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact expectation values of the fields e^{a\phi} in the Bullough-Dodd model
are derived by adopting the ``reflection relations'' which involve the
reflection S-matrix of the Liouville theory, as well as special analyticity
assumption. Using this result we propose explicit expressions for expectation
values of all primary operators in the c<1 minimal CFT perturbed by the
operator \Phi_{1,2} or Phi_{2,1}. Some results concerning the $\Phi_{1,5}$
perturbed minimal models are also presented.
