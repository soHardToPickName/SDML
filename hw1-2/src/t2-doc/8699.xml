Characteristic cohomology of $p$-form gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The characteristic cohomology $H^k_{char}(d)$ for an arbitrary set of free
$p$-form gauge fields is explicitly worked out in all form degrees $k<n-1$,
where $n$ is the spacetime dimension. It is shown that this cohomology is
finite-dimensional and completely generated by the forms dual to the field
strengths. The gauge invariant characteristic cohomology is also computed. The
results are extended to interacting $p$-form gauge theories with gauge
invariant interactions. Implications for the BRST cohomology are mentioned.
