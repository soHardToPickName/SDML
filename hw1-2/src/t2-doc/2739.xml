Supersymmetry Breaking Through Confining and Dual Theory Gauge Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that theories in the confining, free magnetic, and conformal phases
can break supersymmetry through dynamical effects. To illustrate this, we
present theories based on the gauge groups $SU(n)\times SU(4)\times U(1)$ and
$SU(n) \times SU(5) \times U(1)$ with the field content obtained by decomposing
an $SU(m)$ theory with an antisymmetric tensor and $m-4$ antifundamentals.
