Four Dimensional String-String Solutions and Symmetries of String
  Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  A string action is considered in four spacetime dimensions which is obtained
by dimensionally reducing the ten dimensional effective action. The equations
of motion admit string like solutions. The symmetry properties of the four
dimensional action is discussed. It is shown that new background configurations
can be generated by implementing suitable $O(d,d)$ transformations.
