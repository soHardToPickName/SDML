Unruh effect as particular Frenet-Serret vacuum radiation and detection
  proposals
</title>

<abstract>
  The paradigmatic Unruh radiation is an ideal and simple case of stationary
scalar vacuum radiation patterns related to worldlines defined as Frenet-Serret
curves. We briefly review the corresponding body of theoretical literature as
well as the proposals that have been suggested to detect these types of quantum
field radiation patterns
