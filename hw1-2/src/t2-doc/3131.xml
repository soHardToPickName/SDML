Comments on D-branes in Kazama-Suzuki models and Landau-Ginzburg
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study D-branes in Kazama-Suzuki models by means of the boundary state
description. We can identify the boundary states of Kazama-Suzuki models with
the solitons in N=2 Landau-Ginzburg theories. We also propose a geometrical
interpretation of the boundary states in Kazama-Suzuki models.
