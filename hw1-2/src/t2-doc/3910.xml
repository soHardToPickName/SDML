Four dimensional R^4 superinvariants through gauge completion
</title>

<abstract>
  We fully compute the N=1 supersymmetrization of the fourth power of the Weyl
tensor in d=4 x-space with the auxiliary fields. In a previous paper, we showed
that their elimination requires an infinite number of terms; we explicitely
compute those terms to order \kappa^4 (three loop). We also write, in
superspace notation, all the possible N=1 actions, in four dimensions, that
contain pure R^4 terms (with coupling constants). We explicitely write these
actions in terms of the \theta components of the chiral density \epsilon and
the supergravity superfields R, G_m, W_{ABC}. Using the method of gauge
completion, we compute the necessary \theta components which allow us to write
these actions in x-space. We discuss under which circumstances can these extra
R^4 correction terms be reabsorbed in the pure supergravity action, and their
relevance to the quantum supergravity/string theory effective actions.
