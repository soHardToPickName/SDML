Multisolitons in a Two-dimensional Skyrme Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Skyrme model can be generalised to a situation where static fields are
maps from one Riemannian manifold to another. Here we study a Skyrme model
where physical space is two-dimensional euclidean space and the target space is
the two-sphere with its standard metric. The model has topological soliton
solutions which are exponentially localised. We describe a superposition
procedure for solitons in our model and derive an expression for the
interaction potential of two solitons which only involves the solitons'
asymptotic fields. If the solitons have topological degree 1 or 2 there are
simple formulae for their interaction potentials which we use to prove the
existence of solitons of higher degree. We explicitly compute the fields and
energy distributions for solitons of degrees between one and six and discuss
their geometrical shapes and binding energies.
