Ectoplasm Has No Topology: The Prelude
</title>

<abstract>
  Preliminary evidence is presented that a long overlooked and critical element
in the fundamental definition of a general theory of integration over curved
Wess-Zumino superspace lies with the imposition of ``the Ethereal Conjecture''
which states the necessity of the superspace to be topologically ``close'' to
its purely bosonic sub-manifold. As a step in proving this, a new theory of
integration of closed super p-forms is proposed.
