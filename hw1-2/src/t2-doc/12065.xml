Lagrangian Approach of the First Class Constrained Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to systematically derive the exact form of local symmetries for
the abelian Proca and CS models, which are converted into first class
constrained systems by the BFT formalism, in the Lagrangian formalism. As
results, without resorting to a Hamiltonian formulation we obtain the
well-known U(1) symmetry for the gauge invariant Proca model, while showing
that for the CS model there exist novel symmetries as well as the usual
symmetry transformations.
