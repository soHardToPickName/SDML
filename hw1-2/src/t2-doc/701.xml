Composite Operators in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a formula for the derivatives of a correlation function of composite
operators with respect to the parameters (i.e., the strong fine structure
constant and the quark mass) of QCD in four-dimensional euclidean space. The
formula is given as spatial integration of the operator conjugate to a
parameter. The operator product of a composite operator and a conjugate
operator has an unintegrable part, and the formula requires divergent
subtractions. By imposing consistency conditions we derive a relation between
the anomalous dimensions of the composite operators and the unintegrable part
of the operator product coefficients.
