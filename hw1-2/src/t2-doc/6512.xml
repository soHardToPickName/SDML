On the Representation of Intermediate States in the Velocity Basis
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the implication of applying the "minimally complex" representation
to study intermediate states. We propose an interpretation of the "velocity
variables" used in the "minimally complex" representation so as to make the
construction consistent with the kinematics of the underlying scattering
process under consideration. We also show that this choice of representation
advocates the use of velocity basis over momentum basis in studying
intermediate states.
