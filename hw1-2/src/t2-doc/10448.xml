Stability Analysis of a Stringy Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the stability of charged black holes in two-dimensional
heterotic string theories that were recently discussed by McGuidan, Nappi and
Yost. In the framework of small time-dependent perturbation, we find that these
black holes are linearly stable.
