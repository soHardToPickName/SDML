Summing the derivative expansion of the effective action
</title>

<abstract>
  The derivative expansion of the effective action is a perturbative
development in derivatives of the fields. The expansion breaks down when some
of the derivatives are too large. We show how to sum exactly the first and
second derivatives and treat perturbatively derivatives higher than second.
