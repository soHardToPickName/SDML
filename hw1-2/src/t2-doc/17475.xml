Soliton Solution of the Integrable Coupled Nonlinear Schrodinger
  Equation of Manakov Type
</title>

<abstract>
  The soliton solution of the integrable coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equation
(NLS) of Manakov type is investigated by using Zakharov-Shabat (ZS) scheme. We
get the bright N-solitons solution by solving the integrable uncoupled NLS of
Manakov type. We also find that there is an elastic collision of the bright
N-solitons.
