Probing the Enhancon via Calculations in Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the N=2 gauge theory on N D7-branes wrapping K3, with D3-brane
probes. In the large N limit, the D7-branes blow up to form an enhancon shell.
We probe the region inside and outside the enhancon shell using the D3-branes,
and compute the probe metric using the Seiberg-Witten formalism. Supergravity
arguments suggest a flat interior up to 1/N corrections, and indeed our results
for the D3-brane probes are consistent with that. By including the dynamics of
the branes, these results, together with those of hep-th/0204050, demonstrate
the robustness of the enhancon mechanism beyond patching together of
supergravity solutions with D-brane source junction conditions.
