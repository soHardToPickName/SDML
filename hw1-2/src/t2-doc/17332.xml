The principle of symmetric bracket invariance as the origin of first and
  second quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  The principle of invariance of the c-number symmetric bracket is used to
derive both the quantum operator commutator relation $[\hat q, \hat p]=i\hbar$
and the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. A c-number dynamical equation is
found which leads to the second quantized field theory of bosons and fermions.
