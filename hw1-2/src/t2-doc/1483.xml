Finite-N Conformality and Gauge Coupling Unification
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I review some aspects of the idea that there is an infra-red
conformal fixed-point at the TeV scale. In particular, it is shown how gauge
coupling unification can be achieved by TeV unification in a semi-simple gauge
group.
