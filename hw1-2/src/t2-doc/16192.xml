Edge Dynamics for BF Theories and Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss BF theories defined on manifolds with spatial boundaries.
Variational arguments show that one needs to augment the usual action with a
boundary term for specific types of boundary conditions. We also show how to
use this procedure to find the boundary actions for theories of gravity with
first order formulations. Possible connection with the membrane approach is
also discussed.
