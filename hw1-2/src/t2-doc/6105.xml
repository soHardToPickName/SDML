Local State Probabilities of Solvable Lattice Models: Relatives of
  $A_{n}^{(1)}$ Family
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the results for the local state probabilities (LSP) of the
solvable lattice models, constructed around rational conformal field theory
given by WZW model on $SO(3)_{4 R}=SU(2)_{4 R} / Z_{2}$ together with primary
field $\phi_{1}$(symmetric tensor of degree 2). Some conjectures for the LSP
for some higher rank relatives of $A_{n}^{(1)}$ face models are also presented.
