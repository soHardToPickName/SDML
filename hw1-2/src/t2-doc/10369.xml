Remarks on Screening in a Gauge-Invariant Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we display a direct and physically attractive derivation of the
screening contribution to the interaction potential in the Chiral Schwinger
model and generalized Maxwell-Chern-Simons gauge theory. It is shown that these
results emerge naturally when a correct separation between gauge-invariant and
gauge degrees of freedom is made. Explicit expressions for gauge-invariant
fields are found.
