Generalized Quantum Inverse Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the quantum inverse scattering method is proposed
replacing the quantum group $RLL$ commutation relations of Lax operators by
reflection equation type $RLRL$ commutation relations. Under some natural
assumptions the most general algebra of this type allowing to construct the
neccessary integrals of motion is found. It serves to describe Lax operators
with completely non-ultralocal commutation relations. An example of this new
formalism is an integrable model on monodromies of flat connections on a
Riemann surface which is related to the XXZ quantum spin chain.
