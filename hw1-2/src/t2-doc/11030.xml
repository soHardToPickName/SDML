Free Boson Representation of $q$-Vertex Operators and their Correlation
  Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A bosonization scheme of the $q$-vertex operators of $\uqa$ for arbitrary
level is obtained. They act as intertwiners among the highest weight modules
constructed in a bosonic Fock space. An integral formula is proposed for
$N$-point functions and explicit calculation for two-point function is
presented.
