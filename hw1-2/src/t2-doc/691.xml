Born-Infeld Dynamics in Uniform Electric Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate various properties of classical configurations of the
Born-Infeld theory in a uniform electric field. This system is involved with
dynamics of (F,Dp) bound states, which are bound states of fundamental strings
and Dp-branes. The uniform electric field can be treated as a constraint on the
asymptotic behavior of the fields on the brane. BPS configurations in this
theory correspond to fundamental strings attached to the (F,Dp) bound state,
and are found to be stable due to force balance. Fluctuations around these
stable configurations are subject to appropriate Dirichlet and Neumann boundary
conditions which are identical with the ones deduced from the ordinary
worldsheet description of the attached string. Additionally, non-BPS solutions
are studied and related physics are discussed.
