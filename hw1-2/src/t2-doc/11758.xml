The M2-brane Soliton on the M5-brane with Constant 3-Form
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a BPS soliton of the effective theory of the M5-brane worldvolume
with constant 3-form representing M2-branes ending on the M5-brane. The
dimensional reduction of this solution agrees with the known results on
D-branes.
