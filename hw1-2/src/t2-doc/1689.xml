D6-branes wrapping Kahler four-cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity duals of D6-branes wrapping Kahler four-cycles
inside a Calabi-Yau threefold, CY_3. We obtain the purely gravitational
M-theory description, which turns out to be a Calabi-Yau fourfold, CY_4. We
also analyze the dynamics of a probe D6 in this background.
