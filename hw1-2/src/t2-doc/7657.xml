Correlation Functions of Conserved Currents in N = 2 Superconformal
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a manifestly supersymmetric formalism, we determine the general
structure of two- and three- point functions of the supercurrent and the
flavour current of N = 2 superconformal field theories. We also express them in
terms of N = 1 superfields and compare to the generic N = 1 correlation
functions. A general discussion of the N = 2 supercurrent superfield and the
multiplet of anomalies and their definition as derivatives with respect to the
supergravity prepotentials is also included.
