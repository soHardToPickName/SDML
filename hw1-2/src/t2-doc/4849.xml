A Note on Gauge Principle and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Classical
  Particle Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The U(1) gauge field is usually induced from the gauge principle, that is,
the extension of global U(1) phase transformation for matter field. However the
phase itself is realized only for quantum theory. In this paper we introduce
the U(1) gauge field and gauge coupling from the gauge principle classically.
The gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken from the out set. The Higgs
mechanism occurs and we obtain the London equation. The Hydrodynamical
interpretation of classical field we utilized is given, and the relation to
super conductivity is discussed.
