Towards finiteness without supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Some aspects of finite quantum field theories in 3+1 dimensions are
discussed. A model with non--supersymmetric particle content and vanishing
one-- and two--loop beta functions for the gauge coupling and one--loop beta
functions for Yukawa--couplings is presented.
