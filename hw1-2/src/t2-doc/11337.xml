Functional Approach to Classical Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Sometime ago it was shown that the operatorial approach to classical
mechanics, pioneered in the 30's by Koopman and von Neumann, can have a
functional version. In this talk we will extend this functional approach to the
case of classical field theories and in particular to the Yang-Mills ones. We
shall show that the issues of gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov determinant arise
also in this classical formalism.
