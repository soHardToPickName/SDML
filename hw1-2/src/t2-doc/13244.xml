A Large N Chiral Transition on a Plaquette
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a model of a chiral transition using the well known large N
transition in two dimensional U(N) lattice gauge theory. Restricting the
model to a single plaquette, we introduce Grassmann variables on the corners of
the plaquette with the natural phase factors of staggered fermions and couple
them to the U(N) link variables. The classical theory has a continuous chiral
symmetry which is broken at strong couplings, but is restored for weak
couplings in the $N \to \infty$ limit.
