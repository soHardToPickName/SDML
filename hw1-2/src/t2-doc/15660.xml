Weight Systems from Feynman Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  We find that the overall UV divergences of a renormalizable field theory with
trivalent vertices fulfil a four-term relation. They thus come close to
establish a weight system. This provides a first explanation of the recent
successful association of renormalization theory with knot theory.
