Regular charged black hole with a charged de Sitter core
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there is a class of regular charged black hole with a charged de
Sitter core similar to the de Sitter-Schwarzschild black hole. One can show
that the total energy momentum tensor for the static and spherically symmetric
photon field can be made conserved even the Coulomb like energy momentum tensor
for photon is not conserved alone. Possible impact and the numerical solutions
of the charged black hole will be shown in this paper.
