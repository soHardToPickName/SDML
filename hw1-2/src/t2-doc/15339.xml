Infinite dimensional symmetry of corner transfer matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some of the recent developments in two dimensional statistical
mechanics in which corner transfer matrices provide the vital link between
the physical system and the representation theory of quantum affine algebras.
This opens many new possibilities, because the eigenstates may be described
using the properties of q-vertex operators.
