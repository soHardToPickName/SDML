D-brane Scattering in IIB String Theory and IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two Dirichlet p-branes with lower dimensional brane charges and
their scattering. We first calculate the cylinder amplitude of open string with
suitable boundary conditions. We compare this result with that in the IIB
matrix model. We find the agreement between them in the long distance, low
velocity, or large field limit. We also find a way to investigate more general
boundary conditions for open string.
