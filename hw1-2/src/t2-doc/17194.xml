Inomogeneous Quantum Groups as Symmetries of Phonons
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum deformed (1+1) Poincare' algebra is shown to be the kinematical
symmetry of the harmonic chain, whose spacing is given by the deformation
parameter. Phonons with their symmetries as well as multiphonon processes are
derived from the quantum group structure. Inhomogeneous quantum groups are thus
proposed as kinematical invariance of discrete systems.
