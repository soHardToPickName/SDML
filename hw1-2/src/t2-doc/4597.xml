Universal Ratios of the Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  The scaling form of the free--energy near a critical point allows for the
definition of various universal ratios of thermodynamical amplitudes. Together
with the critical exponents they characterize the universality classes and may
be useful experimental quantities. We show how these universal quantities can
be computed for a particular class of universality by using several Quantum
Field Theory methods
