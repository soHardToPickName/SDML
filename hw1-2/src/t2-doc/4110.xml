Gravitating monopoles and black holes in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Higgs
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  We find static spherically symmetric monopoles in Einstein-Born-Infeld-Higgs
model in 3+1 dimensions. The solutions exist only when a parameter $\a $
(related to the strength of Gravitational interaction) does not exceed certain
critical value. We also discuss magnetically charged non Abelian black holes in
this model. We analyse these solutions numerically.
