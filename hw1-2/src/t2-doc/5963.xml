Deformations of the root systems and new solutions to generalised WDVV
  equations
</title>

<abstract>
  A special class of solutions to the generalised WDVV equations related to a
finite set of covectors is investigated. Some geometric conditions on such a
set which guarantee that the corresponding function satisfies WDVV equations
are found (check-conditions). These conditions are satisfied for all root
systems and their special deformations discovered in the theory of the
Calogero-Moser systems by O.Chalykh, M.Feigin and the author. This leads to the
new solutions for the generalized WDVV equations.
