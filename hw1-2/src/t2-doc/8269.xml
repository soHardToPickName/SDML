Covariant quantization of membrane dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  A Lorentz covariant quantization of membrane dynamics is defined, which also
leaves unbroken the full three dimensional diffeomorphism invariance of the
membrane. Among the applications studied are the reduction to string theory,
which may be understood in terms of the phase space and constraints, and the
interpretation of physical,zero-energy states. A matrix regularization is
defined as in the light cone gauged fixed theory but there are difficulties
implementing all the gauge symmetries. The problem involves the
non-area-preserving diffeomorphisms which are realized non-linearly in the
classical theory. In the quantum theory they do not seem to have a consistent
implementation for finite N. Finally, an approach to a genuinely background
independent formulation of matrix dynamics is briefly described.
