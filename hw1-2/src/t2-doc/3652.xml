The Spectrum of Topologically Massive Quantum Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility for the spectrum of topologically massive quantum
electrodynamics with spinor matter fields to contain unexpected and unusual
stable particle excitations for certain values of the topological photon mass.
The new field theoretical phenomena arising from this novel spectral structure
are briefly discussed.
