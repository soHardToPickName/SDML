Comments on Superstring Interactions in a Plane-Wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  The three string vertex for Type IIB superstrings in a maximally
supersymmetric plane-wave background is investigated. Specifically, we derive a
factorization theorem for the Neumann coefficients that generalizes a
flat-space result that was obtained some 20 years ago. The resulting formula is
used to explore the leading large mu asymptotic behavior, which is relevant for
comparison with dual gauge theory results.
