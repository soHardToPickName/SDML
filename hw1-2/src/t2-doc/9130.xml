Off-Shell Duality in Maxwell and Born-Infeld Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is well known that the classical equations of motion of Maxwell and
Born-Infeld theories are invariant under a duality symmetry acting on the field
strengths. We review the implementation of the SL(2,Z) duality in these
theories as linear but non-local transformations of the potentials.
