Matrix Schwarzschild Black Holes in Large N limit
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a gas picture of D0-brane partons, it is shown that the entropy, as
well as the geometric size of an infinitely boosted Schwarzschild black hole,
can be accounted for in matrix theory by interactions involving spins, or
interactions involving more than two bodies simultaneously.
