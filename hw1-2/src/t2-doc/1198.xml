A Matrix Model for Type 0 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A matrix model for type 0 strings is proposed. It consists in making a
non-supersymmetric orbifold projection in the Yang-Mills theory and identifying
the infrared configurations of the system at infinite coupling with strings.
The correct partition function is calculated. Also, the usual spectrum of
branes is found. Both type A and B models are constructed. The model in a torus
contains all the degrees of freedom and interpolates between the four string
theories (IIA, IIB, 0A, 0B) and the M theory as different limits are taken.
