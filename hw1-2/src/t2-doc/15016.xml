Singular Vectors of the Virasoro Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We give expressions for the singular vectors in the highest weight
representations of the Virasoro algebra. We verify that the expressions ---
which take the form of a product of operators applied to the highest weight
vector --- do indeed define singular vectors. These results explain the
patterns of embeddings amongst Virasoro algebra highest weight representations.
