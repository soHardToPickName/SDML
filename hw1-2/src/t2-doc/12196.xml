On minimal coupling of the ABC-superparticle to supergravity background
</title>

<abstract>
  By rigorous application of the Hamiltonian methods we show that the
ABC-formulation of the Siegel superparticle admits consistent minimal coupling
to external supergravity. The consistency check proves to involve all the
supergravity constraints.
