A Model of Three-Dimensional Lattice Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A model is proposed which generates all oriented $3d$ simplicial complexes
weighted with an invariant associated with a topological lattice gauge theory.
When the gauge group is $SU_q(2)$, $q^n=1,$ it is the Turaev-Viro invariant and
the model may be regarded as a non-perturbative definition of $3d$ simplicial
quantum gravity. If one takes a finite abelian group $G$, the corresponding
invariant gives the rank of the first cohomology group of a complex
\nolinebreak $C$: $I_G(C) = rank(H^1(C,G))$, which means a topological
expansion in the Betti number $b^1$. In general, it is a theory of the
Dijkgraaf-Witten type, $i.e.$ determined completely by the fundamental group of
a manifold.
