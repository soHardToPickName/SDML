Algebraic-geometrical formulation of two-dimensional quantum gravity

We find a volume form on moduli space of double punctured Riemann surfaces
whose integral satisfies the Painlev\'e I recursion relations of the genus
expansion of the specific heat of 2D gravity. This allows us to express the
asymptotic expansion of the specific heat as an integral on an infinite
dimensional moduli space in the spirit of Friedan-Shenker approach. We outline
a conjectural derivation of such recursion relations using the
Duistermaat-Heckman theorem.
