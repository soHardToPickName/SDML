Exact renormalization group equation and decoupling in quantum field
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  New proves of decoupling of massive fields in several quantum field theories
are derived in the effective Lagrangian approach based on Wilson
renormalization group. In the most interesting case of gauge theories with
spontaneous symmetry breaking, the approach, combined with the quantum action
principle, leads to a rather simple proof to all orders.
