On the generalizations of Poisson structures
</title>

<abstract>
  The characterization of the Nambu-Poisson n-tensors as a subfamily of the
Generalized-Poisson ones recently introduced (and here extended to the odd
order case) is discussed. The homology and cohomology complexes of both
structures are compared, and some physical considerations are made.
