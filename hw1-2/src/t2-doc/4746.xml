Massive Schwinger model and its confining aspects on curved space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a covariant method to regularize the composite operators, we obtain the
bosonized action of the massive Schwinger model on a classical curved
background. Using the solution of the bosonic effective action, the energy of
two static external charges with finite and large distance separation on a
static curved space-time is obtained. The confining behavior of this model is
also explicitly discussed.
