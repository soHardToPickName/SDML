Response of an electron system to a periodic potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a quantum field theoretical treatment of a one dimensional electron
system with a fixed chemical potential $\mu$. The non-perturbative Lindhard
response function is found for an electron system in a sinusoidal potential.
