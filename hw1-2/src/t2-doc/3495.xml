The Semispin Groups in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In discussions of the T-duality between the two heterotic string theories,
the duality is actually implemented through the "common" SO(16) x SO(16)
subgroup of "SO(32)" and E_8 x E_8. In fact, however, a global investigation
shows that no such "common" subgroup exists. This paper is a survey of the
relevant global properties of Spin(32)/Z_2 and its subgroups.
