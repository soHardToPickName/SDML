Bosonic M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture that there exists a strong coupling limit of bosonic string
theory which is related to the 26 dimensional theory in the same way that 11
dimensional M theory is related to superstring theory. More precisely, we
believe that bosonic string theory is the compactification on a line interval
of a 27 dimensional theory whose low energy limit contains gravity and a
three-form potential. The line interval becomes infinite in the strong coupling
limit, and this may provide a stable ground state of the theory. We discuss
some of the consequences of this conjecture.
