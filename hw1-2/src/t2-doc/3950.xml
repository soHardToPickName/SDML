PT symmetry and supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A re-formulated, non-Hermitian version of the Witten's supersymmetric quantum
mechanics is presented. Its use of pseudo-Hermitian (so called PT symmetric)
Hamiltonians is reviewed and illustrated via several forms of an innovated
supersymmetric partnership between strongly singular ("spiked") harmonic
oscillators.
