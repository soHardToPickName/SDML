Zero Modes and Conformal Anomaly in Liouville Vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  The partition function of a two dimensional Abelian gauge model reproducing
magnetic vortices is discussed in the harmonic approximation. Classical
solutions exhibit conformal invariance, that is broken by statistical
fluctuations, apart from an exceptional case. The corresponding ``anomaly'' has
been evaluated. Zero modes of the thermal fluctuation operator have been
carefully discussed.
