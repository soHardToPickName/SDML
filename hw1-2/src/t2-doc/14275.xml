Stringy Domain Walls of N=1, D=4 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine domain wall solutions of N=1, D=4 supergravity which preserve half
of the supersymmetry and arise from Euclidean M2-brane instantons on M5-branes
wrapping associative 3-cycles of G_2 holonomy manifolds. We also investigate
composite solutions which break an additional half of the supersymmetry.
