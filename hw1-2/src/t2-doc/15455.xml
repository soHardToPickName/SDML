Bethe Ansatz for Lattice Analogues of $N=2$ Superconformal Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The critical Boltzmann weights for lattice analogues of the $N=2$
superconformal coset models $\frac{G_1 \times SO(dim(G/H))}{H}$ were given in
\cite{nick}. In this paper Bethe Ansatz methods are employed to calculate the
spectrum of the transfer matrix obtained from these Boltzmann weights. {}From
this the central charge and conformal weights are obtained by calculating
finite-size corrections to the free energy per site. The results agree with
those obtained from the superconformal model.
