Nonlinear Realization of the General Covariance Group Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  A modified algorithm for the construction of nonlinear realizations (sigma
models) is applied to the general covariance group. Our method features finite
dimensionality of the coset manifold by letting the vacuum stability group be
infinite. No decomposition of the symmetry group to its finite-dimensional
subgroups is required.
  The expected result, i.e. Einstein-Cartan gravity, is finally obtained.
