Baldness/delocalization in intersecting brane systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Marginally bound systems of two types of branes are considered, such as the
prototypical case of Dp+4 branes and Dp branes. As the transverse separation
between the two types of branes goes to zero, different behaviour occurs in the
supergravity solutions depending on p; no-hair theorems result for p<=1 only.
Within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, these supergravity no-hair
results are understood as dual manifestations of the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner
theorem. Furthermore, the rates of delocalization for p<=1 are matched in a
scaling analysis. Talk given at ``Strings '99''; based on hep-th/9903213 with
D. Marolf.
