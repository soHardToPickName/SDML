Comments on a Full Quantization of the Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  Gotay showed that a representation of the whole Poisson algebra of the torus
given by geometric quantization is irreducible with respect to the most natural
overcomplete set of observables. We study this representation and argue that it
cannot be considered as physically acceptable. In particular, classically
bounded observables are quantized by operators with unbounded spectrum.
Effectively, the latter amounts to lifting the constraints that compactify both
directions in the torus.
