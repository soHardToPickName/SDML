Relic gravitons from non-singular string cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of the pre-Big Bang scenario of string cosmology, we propose a
modified equation for the evolution of the tensor perturbations, which includes
the full contribution of possible higher-order curvature and coupling
corrections required to regularise the background evolution. We then discuss
the high-frequency branch of the spectrum of primordial gravitons.
