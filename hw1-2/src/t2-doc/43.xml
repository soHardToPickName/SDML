Fuzzy Cosets and their Gravity Duals
</title>

<abstract>
  Dp-branes placed in a certain external RR (p+4)-form field expand into a
transverse fuzzy two-sphere, as shown by Myers. We find that by changing the
(p+4)-form background other fuzzy cosets can be obtained. Three new examples,
S^2 X S^2, CP^2 and SU(3)/(U(1) X U(1)) are constructed. The first two are
four-dimensional while the last is six-dimensional. The dipole and quadrupole
moments which result in these configurations are discussed. Finally, the
gravity backgrounds dual to these vacua are examined in a leading order
approximation. These are multi-centered solutions containing (p+4)- or
(p+6)-dimensional brane singularities.
