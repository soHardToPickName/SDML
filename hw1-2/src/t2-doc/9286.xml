Supergravity Coupled to Chiral and Yang-Mills Matter at One Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the full result for the divergent one-loop contribution to the
effective boson Lagrangian for supergravity coupled to chiral and Yang-Mills
supermultiplets. We also consider the specific case of dilaton couplings in
effective supergravity Lagrangians from superstrings, for which the one-loop
result is considerably simplified.
