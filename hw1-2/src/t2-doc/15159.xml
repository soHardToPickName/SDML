Choptuik Scaling and Quasinormal Modes in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish an exact connection between the Choptuik scaling parameter for
the three-dimensional BTZ black hole, and the imaginary part of the quasinormal
frequencies for scalar perturbations. Via the AdS/CFT correspondence, this
leads to an interpretation of Choptuik scaling in terms of the timescale for
return to equilibrium of the dual conformal field theory.
