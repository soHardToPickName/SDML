Branes and Vector-like Supersymmetry Breaking Theories with Gauged
  Global Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the brane configuration describing the
Izawa-Yanagida-Intriligator-Thomas (IYIT) model with gauged U(1) subgroup of
the global symmetry contains inconsistent geometry, implying that there exists
a stable vacuum where supersymmetry is dynamically broken.
