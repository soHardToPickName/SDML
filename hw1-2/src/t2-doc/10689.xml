Harmonic Superspaces and Superconformal Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Representations of four-dimensional superconformal groups on harmonic
superfields are discussed. It is argued that any representation can be given as
a superfield on many superflag manifolds. Representations on analytic
superspaces do not require constraints. We discuss short representations and
how to obtain them as explicit products of fundamental fields. We also discuss
superfields that transform under supergroups.
