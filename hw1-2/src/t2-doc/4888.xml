Coulomb Gas on the Half Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  The Coulomb-gas description of minimal models is considered on the half
plane. Screening prescriptions are developed by the perturbative expansion of
the Liouville theory with imaginary coupling and with Neumann boundary
condition on the bosonic field. To generate the conformal blocks of more
general boundary conditions, we propose the insertion of boundary operations.
