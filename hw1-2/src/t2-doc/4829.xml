More Results in $N=1$ Supersymmetric Gauge Theories

<abstract>
  We present the exact effective superpotentials in $4d$, $N=1$ supersymmetric
$SU(2)$ gauge theories with $N_3$ triplets and $N_2$ doublets of matter
superfields. For the theories with a single triplet matter superfield we
present the exact gauge couplings for arbitrary bare masses and Yukawa
couplings.
