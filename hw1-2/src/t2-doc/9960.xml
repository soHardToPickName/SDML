Rotating D-branes and O-planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We review orientifold constructions in the presence of magnetic backgrounds
both in the open and closed sectors. Generically, the resulting orientifold
models have a nice geometric description in terms of rotated D-branes and/or
O-planes. In the case of multiple magnetic backgrounds, some amount of
supersymmetry is recovered if the magnetic fields are suitably chosen and part
of the original D-branes and/or O-planes are transmuted into new ones.
