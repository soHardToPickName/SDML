Rotating Black Holes in Higher Dimensional Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  A black string generaliztion of the Myers-Perry N dimensional rotating black
hole is considered in an (N+1) dimensional Randall-Sundrum brane world. The
black string intercepts the (N-1) brane in a N dimensional rotating black hole.
We examine the diverse cases arising for various non-zero rotation components
and obtain the geodesic equations for these space-time. The asymptotics of
theresulting brane world geometries and their implications are discussed.
