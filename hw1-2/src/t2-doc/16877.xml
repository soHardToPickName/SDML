Monte-Carlo Simulation of Domain-Wall Network in Two-dimensional
  Extended Supersymmetric Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We will show that 2-dimensional N=2-extended supersymmetric theory can have
solitonic solution using the Hamilton-Jacobi method of classical mechanics.
Then it is shown that the Bogomol'nyi mass bound is saturated by these
solutions and triangular mass inequality is satisfied. At the end, we will
mention domain-wall structure in 3-dimensional spacetime.
