Deformed W-algebras as Symmetries of Generalized Integrable Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  A unified description of the relationship between the Hamiltonian structure
of a large class of integrable hierarchies of equations and W-algebras is
discussed. The main result is an explicit formula showing that the former can
be understood as a deformation of the latter.
