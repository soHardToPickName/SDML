Duality between quark-quark and quark-antiquark pairing in 1+1
  dimensional large N models
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify a canonical transformation which maps the chiral Gross-Neveu
model onto a recently proposed Cooper pair model. Baryon number and axial
charge are interchanged. The same physics can be described either as chiral
symmetry breaking (quark-antiquark pairing) or as superconductivity
(quark-quark pairing).
