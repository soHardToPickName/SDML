Strings, Black Holes and Lorentz Contraction
</title>

<abstract>
  Consistency of quantum mechanics in black hole physics requires unusual
Lorentz transformation properties of the size and shape of physical systems
with momentum beyond the Planck scale. A simple parton model illustrates the
kind of behavior which is needed. It is then shown that conventional
fundamental string theory shares these features.
