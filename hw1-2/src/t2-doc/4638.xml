Breaking CP and supersymmetry with orbifold moduli dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the stabilization of string moduli and resulting soft
supersymmetry-breaking terms in heterotic string orbifolds. Among the results
obtained are: formulae for the scalar interaction soft terms without
integrating out the hidden sector gaugino condensate, which reduce to standard
expressions in the usual "truncated" limit; an expression for the modular
transformation of A-terms; a study of the minima of the scalar potential in the
Kaehler modulus direction; and a discussion of the implications for CP
violation phenomenology.
  Some closely related results have appeared in a recent paper of Khalil,
Lebedev and Morris, namely the exact modular invariance of A-terms up to
unitary mixing, and the existence of certain complex minima for the moduli.
