Fusion & Tensoring of Conformal Field Theory and Composite Fermion
  Picture of Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new way for describing the transition between two quantum Hall
effect states with different filling factors within the framework of rational
conformal field theory. Using a particular class of non-unitary theories, we
explicitly recover Jain's picture of attaching flux quanta by the fusion rules
of primary fields. Filling higher Landau levels of composite fermions can be
described by taking tensor products of conformal theories. The usual projection
to the lowest Landau level corresponds then to a simple coset of these tensor
products with several U(1)-theories divided out. These two operations -- the
fusion map and the tensor map -- can explain the Jain series and all other
observed fractions as exceptional cases. Within our scheme of transitions we
naturally find a field with the experimentally observed universal critical
exponent 7/3.
