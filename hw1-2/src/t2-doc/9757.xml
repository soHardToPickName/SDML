Are Strings Thermostrings?
</title>

<abstract>
  In the method of thermostring quantization the time evolution of point
particles at finite temperature kT is described in a geometric manner. The
temperature paths of particles are represented as closed (thermo)strings, which
are swept surfaces in space-time-temperature manifold. The method makes it
possible a new physical interpretation of superstrings IIA and heterotic
strings as point particles in a thermal bath with Planck temperature.
