Tensionless p-branes with manifest conformal invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization of the tensionless p-brane is discussed. Inspection of the
constraint algebra reveals that the central extensions for the p-branes have a
simple form. Using a Hamiltonian BRST scheme we find that the quantization is
consistent in any space-time dimension while the quantization of the conformal
tensionless p-brane gives a critical dimension $d=2$.
