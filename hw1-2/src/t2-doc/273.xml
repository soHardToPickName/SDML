On the Chern-Simons topological term at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The parity-violating topological term in the effective action for 2+1 massive
fermions is computed at finite temperature in the presence of a constant
background field strength tensor. Gauge invariance of the finite-temperature
effective action is also discussed.
