Chiral phase in fermionic measure and the resolution of the strong CP
  problem
</title>

<abstract>
  The fermionic measure in the functional integral of a gauge theory suffers
from an ambiguity in the form of a chiral phase. By fixing it, one is led once
again to the conclusion that a chiral phase in the quark mass term of QCD has
no effect and cannot cause CP violation.
