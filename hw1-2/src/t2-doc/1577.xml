k-Factorization
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the k-factorization method to combine the high-energy behaviour in
QCD with the renormalization group. Resummation formulas for coefficient
functions and anomalous dimensions are derived, and their applications to
small-x scaling violations in structure functions are briefly discussed.
