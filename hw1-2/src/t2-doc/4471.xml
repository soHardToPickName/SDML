Dimensional Reduction, Gauged D=5 Supergravity and Brane Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  The U(1) gauged version of the Strominger-Vafa five dimensional N=2
supergravity with one vector multiplet is obtained via dimensional reduction
from the N=1 ten dimensional supergavity. Using such explicit relation between
the gauged supergravity theory and ten dimensional supergravity, all known
solutions of the five dimensional theory can be lifted up to ten-dimensions.
The eleven dimensional solutions can also obtained by lifting the
ten-dimensional solutions.
