Master Field on Fuzzy Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The O(N) symmetric vector model is considered on both ordinary and fuzzy
sphere. It is shown that in both cases master fields exist and their explicit
forms are presented. They are found to mix the internal symmetry and the
(fuzzy) space-time symmetry. It is also argued that the cutoff brought by the
fuzzy sphere plays an essential role in constructing the master field.
