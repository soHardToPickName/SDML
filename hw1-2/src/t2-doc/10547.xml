Curved, extended classical solutions I. The undulating kink
</title>

<abstract>
  The energy of extended classical objects, such as vortices, depends on their
shape. In particular, we show that the curvature energy of a kink in two
spatial dimensions, as a prototype of extended classical solutions, is always
negative. We obtain a closed form for the curvature energy, assuming small
deviations from the straight line.
