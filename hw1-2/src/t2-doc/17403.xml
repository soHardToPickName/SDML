Geometry of T-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  A "reduced" differential geometry adapted to the presence of abelian
isometries is constructed.Classical T-duality diagonalizes in this setting,
allowing us to get conveniently the transformation of the relevant geometrical
objects such as connections, pullbacks and generalized curvatures.Moreover we
can induce privileged maps from the viewpoint of the covariant derivatives in
the target-space and in the world-sheet generalizing previous results, at the
same time that we can correct connections and curvatures covariantly in order
to have a proper transformation under T-duality.
