Scalar Symmetries of the Hubbard Models with Variable Range Hopping
</title>

<abstract>
  Examples of scalar conserved currents are presented for trigonometric,
hyperbolic and elliptic versions of the Hubbard model with non-nearest
neighbour variable range hopping. They support for the first time the
hypothesis about the integrability of the elliptic version. The two- electron
wave functions are constructed in an explicit form.
