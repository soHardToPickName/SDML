B\"acklund Transformations an Zero-Curvature Representations of Systems
  of Partial Differential Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that B\"acklund transformations (BTs) and zero-curvature
representations (ZCRs) of systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) are
closely related. The connection is established by nonlinear representations of
the symmetry group underlying the ZCR which induce gauge transformations
relating different BTs. This connection is used to construct BTs from ZCRs (and
vice versa). Furthermore a procedure is outlined which allows a systematic
search for ZCRs of a given system of PDEs.
