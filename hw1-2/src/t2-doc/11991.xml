The Wu-Yang Ambiguity Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  Several examples are given of continuous families of SU(2) vector potentials
$A_i^a(x)$ in 3 space dimensions which generate the same magnetic field
$B^{ai}(x)$ (with det $B\neq 0$). These Wu-Yang families are obtained from the
Einstein equation $R_{ij}=-2G_{ij}$ derived recently via a local map of the
gauge field system into a spatial geometry with $2$-tensor $G_{ij}=B^a{}_i
B^a{}_j\det B$ and connection $\Gamma_{jk}^i$ with torsion defined from gauge
covariant derivatives of $B$.
