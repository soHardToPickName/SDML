Duality of Lorentzian and Euclidean black holes in two-dimensional
  string-generated models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the properties of lorentzian and euclidean black hole solutions of
a generalized 2-dim dilaton-gravity action containing a modulus field, which
arises from the compactification of heterotic string models. The duality
symmetries of these solutions are also investigated.
