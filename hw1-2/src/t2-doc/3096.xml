$R$-matrices for the $n=2,3$ Elliptic Calogero-Moser Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical (dynamical) $R$-matrices for the 2- and 3-body Calogero-Moser
models with elliptic potentials are given. The 3-body case has an interesting
nontrivial structure that goes beyond the known ansatz for momentum independent
$R$-matrices. The $R$-matrices presented include the dynamical $R$-matrices of
Avan and Talon as degenerate cases of the elliptic potential.
