  Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to topological gravity

<abstract>
  It is argued that gravitational descendants in Landau-Ginsburg theory coupled
to topological gravity can be constructed from the matter fields only. For
example, $\sigma_1 (\Phi) = V'\int \Phi$. This descendants turn out to be
connected with K.Saito higher residue pairing. Naive computaitions are
corrected with the help of the contact term, the form of this term is found.
k-point correlation functions on a sphere are calculated.
