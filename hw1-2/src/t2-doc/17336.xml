Coherent-state path-integral approach for constrained fermion systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The coherent-state path-integral representation for the propagator of
fermionic systems subjected to first-class constraints is constructed. As in
the bosonic case the importance of path-integral measures for Lagrange
multipliers is emphasized. One example is discussed in some detail.
