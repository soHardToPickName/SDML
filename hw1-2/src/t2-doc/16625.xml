  We analyze the spectrum of the bosonic and superstring on the orbifold of the
space-time by a boost, leading to the cosmological singularity. We show that
the modular invariance leads to the spectrum where the twisted sector tachyon,
together with all other twisted sector fields, present in the Euclidean version
of the orbifold, is absent. This makes impossible to resolve the singularity by
a marginal deformation of the worldsheet CFT. We also establish a relation
between the resolution of rotational orbifolds in Euclidean and Lorentzian
setups, and quantum groups. The analysis confirms the impossibility of
resolving the cosmological orbifold singularity.
