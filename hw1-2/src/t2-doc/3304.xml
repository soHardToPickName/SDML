The Geometric Construction of WZW Effective Action in Non-commutative
  Manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  By constructing close one cochain density ${\Omega^1}_{2n}$ in the gauge
group space we get WZW effective Lagrangian on high dimensional non-commutative
space.Especially consistent anomalies derived from this WZW effective action in
non-commutative four-dimensional space coincides with those by L.Bonora
etc.
