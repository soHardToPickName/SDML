Aspects of Causality and Unitarity and Comments on Vortex-like
  Configurations in an Abelian Model with a Lorentz-Breaking Term
</title>

<abstract>
  The gauge-invariant Chern-Simons-type Lorentz- and CPT-breaking term is here
reassessed and a spin-projector method is adopted to account for the breaking
(vector) parameter. Issues like causality, unitarity, spontaneous
gauge-symmetry breaking and vortex formation are investigated, and consistency
conditions on the external vector are identified.
