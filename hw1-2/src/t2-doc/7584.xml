Feynman rules for string field theories with discrete target space
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a minimal set of Feynman rules for the loop amplitudes in unitary
models of closed strings, whose target space is a simply laced (extended)
Dynkin diagram. The string field Feynman graphs are composed of propagators,
vertices (including tadpoles) of all topologies, and leg factors for the
macroscopic loops. A vertex of given topology factorizes into a fusion
coefficient for the matter fields and an intersection number associated with
the corresponding punctured surface. As illustration we obtain explicit
expressions for the genus-one tadpole and the genus-zero four-loop amplitude.
