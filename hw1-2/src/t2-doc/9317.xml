D=6, N=2, F(4)-Supergravity with supersymmetric de Sitter Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there exists a supersymmetric de Sitter background for the D=6,
N=2, F(4) supergravity preserving the compact R-symmetry and gauging with
respect to the conventional Anti de Sitter version of the theory. We construct
the gauged matter coupled F(4) de Sitter supergravity explicitly and show that
it contains ghosts in the vector sector.
