The mass formula for a fundamental string as a BPS solution of a
  D-brane's worldvolume
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a (generalized) ``mass formula'' for a fundamental string
described as a BPS solution of a D-brane's worldvolume. The mass formula is
obtained by using the Hamiltonian density on the worldvolume, based on
transformation properties required for it. Its validity is confirmed by
investigating the cases of point charge solutions of D-branes in a D-8-brane
(i.e. curved) background, where the mass of each of the corresponding strings
is proportional to the geodesic distance from the D-brane to the point
parametrized by the (regularized) value of a transverse scalar field. It is
also shown that the mass of the string agrees with the energy defined on the
D-brane's worldvolume only in the flat background limit, but the agreement does
not always hold when the background is curved.
