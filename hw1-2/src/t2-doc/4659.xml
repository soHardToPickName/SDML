<abstract>
  We study a quantum Yang-Baxter structure associated with non-ultralocal
lattice models. We discuss the canonical structure of a class of integrable
quantum mappings, i.e. canonical transformations preserving the basic
commutation relations. As a particular class of solutions we present two
examples of quantum mappings associated with the lattice analogues of the KdV
and MKdV equations, together with their exact quantum invariants. plain LaTeX,
