On the combinatorics of row and corner transfer matrices of the
  $A_{n-1}^{(1)}$ restricted face models

<abstract>
  We establish a weight-preserving bijection between the index sets of the
spectral data of row-to-row and corner transfer matrices for
$U_q\widehat{sl(n)}$ restricted interaction round a face (IRF) models. The
evaluation of momenta by adding Takahashi integers in the spin chain language
is shown to directly correspond to the computation of the energy of a path on
the weight lattice in the two-dimensional model. As a consequence we derive
fermionic forms of polynomial analogues of branching functions for the cosets
${(A^{(1)}_{n-1})_{\ell -1}\otimes (A^{(1)}_{n-1})_{1}} \over
(A^{(1)}_{n-1})_{\ell}$, and establish a bosonic-fermionic polynomial identity.
