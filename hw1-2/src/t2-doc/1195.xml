Antisymmetric tensor fields on spheres: functional determinants and
  non--local counterterms
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hodge--de Rham Laplacian on spheres acting on antisymmetric tensor fields
is considered. Explicit expressions for the spectrum are derived in a quite
direct way, confirming previous results. Associated functional determinants and
the heat kernel expansion are evaluated. Using this method, new non--local
counterterms in the quantum effective action are obtained, which can be
expressed in terms of Betti numbers.
