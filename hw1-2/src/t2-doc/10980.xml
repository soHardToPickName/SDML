Non-Abelian Structures in BSFT and RR couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk we show that the tachyon annihilation combined with an
approximation, in which string theory non-commutativity structure is captured
by the algebra of differential operators on space-time, gives a unified point
of view on: non-Abelian structures on $D$-branes; all lowest energy excitations
on $D$-branes; all RR couplings in type II string theory.
