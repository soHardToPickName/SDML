Trans-Planckian redshifts and the substance of the space-time river

<abstract>
  Trans-Planckian redshifts in cosmology and outside black holes may provide
windows on a hypothetical short distance cutoff on the fundamental degrees of
freedom. In cosmology, such a cutoff seems to require a growing Hilbert space,
but for black holes, Unruh's sonic analogy has given rise to both field
theoretic and lattice models demonstrating how such a cutoff in a fixed Hilbert
space might be compatible with a low energy effective quantum field theory of
the Hawking effect. In the lattice case, the outgoing modes arise via a Bloch
oscillation from ingoing modes. A short distance cutoff on degrees of freedom
is incompatible with local Lorentz invariance, but may nevertheless be
compatible with general covariance if the preferred frame is defined
non-locally by the cosmological background. Pursuing these ideas in a different
direction, condensed matter analogs may eventually allow for laboratory
observations of the Hawking effect. This paper introduces and gives a fairly
complete but brief review of the work that has been done in these areas, and
tries to point the way to some future directions.
