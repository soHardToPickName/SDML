Finite N analysis of matrix models for n-Ising spin on a random surface
</title>

<abstract>
  The saddle point equation described by the eigenvalues of N by N Hermitian
matrices is analized for a finite N case and the scaling relation for the large
N is considered. The critical point and the critical exponents of matrix model
are obtained by the finite N scaling. One matrix model and two matrix model are
studied in detail. Small N behavior for n-Ising model on a random surface is
investigated.
