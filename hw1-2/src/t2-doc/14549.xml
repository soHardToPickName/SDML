Improved Epstein-Glaser Renormalization II. Lorentz invariant framework
</title>

<abstract>
  The Epstein--Glaser type T-subtraction introduced by one of the authors in
aprevious paper is extended to the Lorentz invariant framework. The advantage
of using our subtraction instead of Epstein and Glaser's standard W-subtraction
method is especially important when working in Minkowski space, as then the
counterterms necessary to keep Lorentz invariance are simplified. We show how
T-renormalization of primitive diagrams in the Lorentz invariant framework
directly relates to causal Riesz distributions. A covariant subtraction rule in
momentum space is found, sharply improving upon the BPHZL method for massless
theories.
