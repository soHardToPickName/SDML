Geodesics, gravitons and the gauge fixing problem
</title>

<abstract>
  When graviton loops are taken into account, the background metric obtained as
a solution to the one-loop corrected Einstein equations turns out to be gauge
fixing dependent. Therefore it is of no physical relevance. Instead we consider
a physical observable, namely the trajectory of a test particle in the presence
of gravitons. We derive a quantum corrected geodesic equation that includes
backreaction effects and is explicitly independent of any gauge fixing
parameter.
