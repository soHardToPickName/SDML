Light-Front Quantization of Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Some basic topics in Light-Front (LF) quantized field theory are reviewed.
Poincar\`e algebra and the LF Spin operator are discussed. The local scalar
field theory of the conventional framework is shown to correspond to a
non-local Hamiltonian theory on the LF in view of the constraint equations on
the phase space, which relate the bosonic condensates to the non-zero modes.
This new ingredient is useful to describe the spontaneous symmetry breaking on
the LF. The instability of the symmetric phase in two dimensional scalar theory
when the coupling constant grows is shown in the LF theory renormalized to one
loop order. Chern-Simons gauge theory, regarded to describe excitations with
fractional statistics, is quantized in the light-cone gauge and a simple LF
Hamiltonian obtained which may allow us to construct renormalized theory of
anyons.
