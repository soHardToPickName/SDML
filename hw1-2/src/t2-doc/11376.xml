Clifford Algebra Derivation of the Characteristic Hypersurfaces of
  Maxwell's Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  An alternative, pedagogically simpler derivation of the allowed physical wave
fronts of a propagating electromagnetic signal is presented using geometric
algebra. Maxwell's equations can be expressed in a single multivector equation
using 3D Clifford algebra (isomorphic to Pauli algebra spinorial formulation of
electromagnetism). Subsequently one can more easily solve for the time
evolution of both the electric and magnetic field simultaneously in terms of
the fields evaluated only on a 3D hypersurface. The form of the special
"characteristic" surfaces for which the time derivative of the fields can be
singular are quickly deduced with little effort.
