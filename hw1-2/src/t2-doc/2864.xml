How the Little Group Constrains Massless Field Representations in Higher
  Even Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Assuming trivial action of Euclidean translations of the little group, we
derive a simple correspondence between massless field representations
transforming under the full generalized even dimensional Lorentz group, and
highest weight states of the relevant little group. This yields a connection
between `helicity' and `chirality' in all dimensions, and highlights the
special nature of the restricted representations under `gauge' transformations.
