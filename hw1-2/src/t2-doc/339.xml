Local Charged States of the Gauge Field in Three Dimensional
  Maxwell-Type Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge invariant local creation operators of charged states are introduced and
studied in pure gauge theories of the Maxwell type in 2+1D. These states are
usually unphysical because of the subsidiary condition imposed on the physical
subspace by Gauss' law. A dual Maxwell theory which possesses a topological
electric charge is introduced. Pure Electrodynamics lies in the sector where
the topological charge identically vanishes. Charge bearing operators fully
expressed in terms of the gauge field, however, can create physical states in
the nontrivial topological sectors which thereby generalize QED. An order
disorder structure exists relating the charged operators and the magnetic flux
creating (vortex) operators, both through commutation rules and correlation
functions. The relevance of this structure for bosonization in 2+1D is
discussed.
