Two-dimensional gravity with an invariant energy scale
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the gauging of a two-dimensional deformation of the Poincare
algebra, which accounts for the existence of an invariant energy scale. The
model describes 2D dilaton gravity with torsion. We obtain explicit solutions
of the field equations and discuss their physical properties.
