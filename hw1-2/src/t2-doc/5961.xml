Simulated Annealing for Topological Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  The search for solutions of field theories allowing for topological solitons
requires that we find the field configuration with the lowest energy in a given
sector of topological charge. The standard approach is based on the numerical
solution of the static Euler-Lagrange differential equation following from the
field energy. As an alternative, we propose to use a simulated annealing
algorithm to minimize the energy functional directly. We have applied simulated
annealing to several nonlinear classical field theories: the sine-Gordon model
in one dimension, the baby Skyrme model in two dimensions and the nuclear
Skyrme model in three dimensions. We describe in detail the implementation of
the simulated annealing algorithm, present our results and get independent
confirmation of the studies which have used standard minimization techniques.
