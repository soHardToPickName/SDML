Enhanced D-Brane Categories from String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct D-brane categories in B-type topological string theory as
solutions to string field equations of motion. Using the formalism of
superconnections, we show that these solutions form a variant of a construction
of Bondal and Kapranov. This analysis is an elaboration on recent work of
Lazaroiu. We also comment on the relation between string field theory and the
derived category approach of Douglas, and Aspinwall and Lawrence.
Non-holomorphic deformations make a somewhat unexpected appearance in this
construction.
