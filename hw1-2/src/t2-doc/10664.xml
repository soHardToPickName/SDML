Gauge Dressing of 2D Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the gauge Ward identities, we study correlation functions of gauged
WZNW models. We show that the gauge dressing of the correlation functions can
be taken into account as a solution of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation. Our
method is analogous to the analysis of the gravitational dressing of 2D field
theories.
