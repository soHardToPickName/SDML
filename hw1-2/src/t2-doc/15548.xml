Representations of the Mapping Class Group of the Two Punctured Torus on
  the Space of \hat {sl}(2,C) Spin1/2-Spin1/2 Kac-Moody Blocks

<abstract>
  The integral representations of the $\hat {sl}(2,C)$ Spin 1/2 - Spin 1/2
Kac-Moody Blocks on the torus, arising from the free field representation of
the $\hat {sl}(2,C)$ Kac-Moody algebra of Wakimoto and Bernard and Felder, are
used to derive an infinite class of representations of the mapping class group
of the two punctured torus.
