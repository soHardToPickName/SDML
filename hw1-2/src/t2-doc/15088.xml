Black Hole Radiation On and Off the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  After a brief review of the description of black holes on branes, we examine
the evaporation of a small black hole on a brane in a world with large extra
dimensions. We show that, contrary to previous claims, most of the energy is
radiated into the modes on the brane. This raises the possibility of observing
Hawking radiation in future high energy colliders if there are large extra
dimensions.
