Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory and Riemannian Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce new local gauge invariant variables for N=1 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory, explicitly parameterizing the physical Hilbert space of the
theory. We show that these gauge invariant variables have a geometrical
interpretation, and can be constructed such that the emergent geometry is that
of N=1 supergravity: a Riemannian geometry with vector-spinor generated
torsion. Full geometrization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is carried
out, and geometry independent divergences associated to the inversion of a
differential operator with zero modes -- that were encountered in the
non-supersymmetric case -- do not arise in this situation.
