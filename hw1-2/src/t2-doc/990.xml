Total Divergences in Hamiltonian Formalism of Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this report it is proposed to generalize the definition of Poisson
brackets in order to treat spatial integrals of divergences as Hamiltonians
which generate a kind of Hamiltonian equations on the boundary. Nonlinear
Schrodinger equation is used as an illustrative example.
