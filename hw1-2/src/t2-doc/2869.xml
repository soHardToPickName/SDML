D0-Branes As Light-Front Confined Quarks
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that different aspects of Light-Front QCD at confined phase can be
recovered by the Matrix Quantum Mechanics of D0-branes. The concerning Matrix
Quantum Mechanics is obtained from dimensional reduction of pure Yang-Mills
theory to 0+1 dimension. The aspects of QCD dynamics which are studied in
correspondence with D0-branes are: 1) phenomenological inter-quark potentials,
2) whiteness of hadrons and 3) scattering amplitudes. In addition, some other
issues such as the large-N behavior, the gravity--gauge theory relation and
also a possible justification for involving ``non-commutative coordinates'' in
a study of QCD bound-states are discussed.
