The Nambu-Goto Theory of Closed Bosonic Strings Moving in
  1+3-Dimensional Minkowski Space: The Construction of the Quantum Algebra of
  Observables up to Degree Five
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum algebra of observables postulated in hep-th/9805057 is
constructed up to degree five. All independent relations of degree four are
given; they involve three as yet undetermined parameters. Definitions and
symbols are used as introduced in the above-mentioned article.
