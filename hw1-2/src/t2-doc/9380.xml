Heterotic versus Type I
</title>

<abstract>
  I compare the calculations of special $F^4$ and $R^4$ terms in the
(toroidally-compactified) heterotic and type-I effective actions. Besides
checking duality, this elucidates the quantitative rules of D-brane calculus. I
explain in particular (a) why D-branes do not run in loops, and (b) how their
instanton contributions arise from orbifold fixed points of their moduli space.
The instanton sum has a simple representation as a sum of the elliptic genera
of matrix models.
