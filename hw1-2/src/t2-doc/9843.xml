From N=1 to N=2 supersymmetries in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from N=1 scalar and vector supermultiplets in 2+1 dimensions, we
construct superfields which constitute Lagrangians invariant under N=2
supersymmetries. We first recover the N=2 supersymmetric Abelian-Higgs model
and then the N=2 pure super Yang-Mills model. The conditions for this elevation
are consistent with previous results found by other authors.
