On the non-relativistic limit of the quantum sine-Gordon model with
  integrable boundary condition
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the the generalized Calogero-Moser model with boundary potential
of the P\"oschl-Teller type describes the non-relativistic limit of the quantum
sine-Gordon model on a half-line with Dirichlet boundary condition.
