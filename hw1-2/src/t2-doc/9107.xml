Intersecting Noncommutative D-branes and Baryons in Magnetic Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric intersecting configurations of D-branes with B-field
backgrounds. Noncommutative D-brane or M-brane pairs can intersect
supersymmetrically over (p-1)-brane, as well as over (p-2)-brane like ordinary
branes. d=10 and d=11 supergravity solutions are obtained and the supersymmetry
projection rule is examined. As an application we study a noncommutative
D7-brane probe in noncommutative D3-brane background, intersecting at
noncommutative plane, which describes BPS baryons of noncommutative gauge
theory in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.
