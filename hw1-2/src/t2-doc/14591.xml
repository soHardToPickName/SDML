A Note on T-Duality, Open Strings in B-field Background and Canonical
  Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study T-duality for open strings ending on branes with
non-zero B-field on them from the point of view of canonical transformations.
For the particular case of type II strings on the two torus we show that the
$Sl(2,Z)_N$ transformations can be understood as a sub-class of canonical
transformations on the open strings in the B-field background.
