The Deformed Matrix Model at Finite Radius and a New Duality Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The $1/x^{2}$ deformed $c=1$ matrix model is studied at finite radius and
non-zero cosmological constant. Calculational techniques are presented and
illustrated in some examples. Furthermore, a new kind of $R \rightarrow 1/R$
duality is discovered which mixes different genus.
