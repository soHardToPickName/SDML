N=4 Supersymmetric Gauge Theory in the Derivative Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  Maximally supersymmetric gauge theories have experienced renewed interest due
to the AdS/CFT correspondence and its conjectured S-duality. These gauge
theories possess a large amount of symmetry and have quasi-integrable
properties. We derive the amplitudes in the derivative expansion of the
spontaneously broken examples and perform all loop integrations. The S-matrix
is found via an algebraic recursion and at each order is SL(2,Z) invariant.
