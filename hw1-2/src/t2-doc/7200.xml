Non-transversal colliding singularities in F-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short introduction to the study of compactifications of F-theory on
elliptic Calabi-Yau threefolds near colliding singularities. In particular we
consider the case of non-transversal intersections of the singular fibers.
