On a Modification of the Boundary State Formalism in Off-shell String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the application of boundary states in computing amplitudes in
off-shell open string theory. We find a straightforward generalization of
boundary state which produces the correct matrix elements with on-shell closed
string states.
