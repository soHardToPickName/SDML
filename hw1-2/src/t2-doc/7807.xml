Ground State of the Quantum Symmetric Finite Size XXZ Spin Chain with
  Anisotropy Parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$

  We find an analytic solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE) for the
special case of a finite XXZ spin chain with free boundary conditions and with
a complex surface field which provides for $U_q(sl(2))$ symmetry of the
Hamiltonian. More precisely, we find one nontrivial solution, corresponding to
the ground state of the system with anisotropy parameter $\Delta = {1/2}$
corresponding to $q^3 = -1$.
