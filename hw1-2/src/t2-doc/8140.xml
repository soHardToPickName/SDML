Discrete Torsion in Singular G_2-Manifolds and Real LG
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate strings at singularities of G_2-holonomy manifolds which arise
in Z_2 orbifolds of Calabi-Yau spaces times a circle. The singularities locally
look like R^4/Z_2 fibered over a SLAG, and can globally be embedded in CICYs in
weighted projective spaces. The local model depends on the choice of a discrete
torsion in the fibration, and the global model on an anti-holomorphic
involution of the Calabi-Yau hypersurface. We determine how these choices are
related to each other by computing a Wilson surface detecting discrete torsion.
We then follow the same orbifolds to the non-geometric Landau-Ginzburg region
of moduli space. We argue that the symmetry-breaking twisted sectors are
effectively captured by real Landau-Ginzburg potentials. In particular, we find
agreement in the low-energy spectra of strings computed from geometry and
Gepner-model CFT. Along the way, we construct the full modular data of
orbifolds of N=2 minimal models by the mirror automorphism, and give a real-LG
interpretation of their modular invariants. Some of the models provide examples
of the mirror-symmetry phenomenon for G_2 holonomy.
