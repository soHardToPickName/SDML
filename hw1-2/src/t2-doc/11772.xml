A geometric approach to D-branes in group manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a brief review of some recent results on the geometric approach to
symmetric D-branes in group manifolds, both twisted and untwisted. We describe
the geometry of the gluing conditions and the quantisation condition in the
boundary WZW model, and we illustrate this by determining the consistent
twisted and untwisted D-branes in the Lie group SU_3.
