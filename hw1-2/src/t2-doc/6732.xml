Superalgebraic Truncations from D=10, N=2 Chiral Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study ten-dimensional N=2 maximal chiral supergravity in the context of
Lie superalgebra SU(8/1). The possible successive superalgebraic truncations
from ten dimensional N=2 chiral theory to the lower dimensional supergravity
theories are systematically realized as sub-superalgebraic chains of SU(8/1) by
using the Kac-Dynkin weight techniques.
