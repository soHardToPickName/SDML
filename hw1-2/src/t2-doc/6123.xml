The Secret Chern-Simons Action for the Hot Gluon Plasma
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the generating functional for hard thermal loops with external
gluons in QCD is essentially given by the eikonal for a Chern-Simons gauge
theory. This action, determined essentially by gauge invariance arguments, also
gives an efficient way of obtaining the hard thermal loop contributions without
the more involved calculation of Feynman diagrams.
