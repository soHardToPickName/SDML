What does E_8 know about 11 dimensions ?
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some possible relationships in gauge theories, string theory and M
theory in the light of some recent results obtained in gauge invariant
supersymmetric quantum mechanics. In particular this reveals a new relationship
between the gauge group E_8 and 11-dimensional space.
