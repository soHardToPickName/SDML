Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball with uniform velocity of
  light at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir energy, free energy and Casimir force are evaluated, at arbitrary
finite temperature, for a dilute dielectric ball with uniform velocity of light
inside the ball and in the surrounding medium. In particular, we investigate
the classical limit at high temperature. The Casimir force found is repulsive,
as in previous calculations.
