Horizon Geometry, Duality and Fixed scalars in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the problem of extremizing the tension for BPS strings in D=6
supergravities with different number of supersymmetries. General formulae for
fixed scalars and a discussion of degenerate directions is given. Quantized
moduli, according to recent analysis, are supposed to be related to conformal
field theories which are the boundary of three dimensional anti-de Sitter space
time.
