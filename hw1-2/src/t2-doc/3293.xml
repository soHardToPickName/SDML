Skyrme model on S_3 and Harmonic maps
</title>

<abstract>
  A non-linear sigma model mimicking the Skyrme model on S_3 is proposed and a
family of classical solutions to the equations are constructed numerically. The
solutions terminate into catastrophe-like spikes at critical values of the
Skyrme coupling constant and, when this constant is zero, they coincide with
the series of Harmonic maps on S_3 constructed some years ago by P. Bizon.
