Counting Domain Walls in N=1 Super Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the multiplicity of BPS domain walls in N=1 super Yang-Mills theory,
by passing to a weakly coupled Higgs phase through the addition of fundamental
matter. The number of domain walls connecting two specified vacuum states is
then determined via the Witten index of the induced worldvolume theory, which
is invariant under the deformation to the Higgs phase. The worldvolume theory
is a sigma model with a Grassmanian target space which arises as the coset
associated with the global symmetries broken by the wall solution. Imposing a
suitable infrared regulator, the result is found to agree with recent work of
Acharya and Vafa in which the walls were realized as wrapped D4-branes in IIA
string theory.
