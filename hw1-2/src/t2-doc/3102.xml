Gravitational anomalies in a dispersive approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The gravitational anomalies in two dimensions, specifically the Einstein
anomaly and the Weyl anomaly, are fully determined by means of dispersion
relations. In this approach the anomalies originate from the peculiar infrared
feature of the imaginary part of the relevant formfactor which approaches a
$\delta$-function singularity at zero momentum squared when $m \to 0$.
