Variational solution of the Gross-Neveu model at finite temperature in
  the large N limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a nonperturbative variational method to investigate the phase
transition of the Gross-Neveu model. It is shown that the variational procedure
can be generalized to the finite temperature case. The large N result for the
phase transition is correctly reproduced.
