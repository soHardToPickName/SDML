Tachyon-free Orientifolds of Type 0B Strings in Various Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct non-tachyonic, non-supersymmetric orientifolds of Type 0B
strings in ten, six and four space-time dimensions. Typically, these models
have unitary gauge groups with charged massless fermionic and bosonic matter
fields. However, generically there remains an uncancelled dilaton tadpole.
