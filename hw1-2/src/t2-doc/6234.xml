An Extension of Distribution Theory Related to Gauge Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a considerable part of the theory of (ultra)distributions and
hyperfunctions can be extended to more singular generalized functions, starting
from an angular localizability notion introduced previously. Such an extension
is needed to treat gauge quantum field theories with indefinite metric in a
generic covariant gauge. Prime attention is paid to the generalized functions
defined on the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $S_\alpha^0$ which gives the widest
framework for construction of gauge-like models. We associate a similar test
function space with every open and every closed cone, show that these spaces
are nuclear and obtain the required formulas for their tensor products. The
main results include the generalization of the Paley--Wiener--Schwartz theorem
to the case of arbitrary singularity and the derivation of the relevant theorem
on holomorphic approximation.
