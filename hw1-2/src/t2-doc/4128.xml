Solution of the SU(2) Mandelstam Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how the Mandelstam constraints for an $SU(2)$ pure lattice gauge
theory with $3{\cal N}$ physical degrees of freedom may be solved completely in
terms of $3{\cal N}$ Wilson and Polyakov loop variables and ${\cal N}-1$ gauge
invariant discrete +/-1 variables, thus enabling a manifestly gauge invariant
formulation of the theory.
