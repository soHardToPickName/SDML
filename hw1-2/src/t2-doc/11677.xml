Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking and the Linear Multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze gaugino condensation in the presence of a dilaton and an
antisymmetric tensor field, with couplings reminiscent of string theories. The
degrees of freedom relevant to a supersymmetric description of the effective
theory below the scale of condensation are discussed in this context.
