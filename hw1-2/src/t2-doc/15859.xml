Some Properties of Pole Solution in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A solution with the pole configuration in six dimensions is analysed both
analytically and numerically. It is a dimensional reduction model of
Randall-Sundrum type. The soliton configuration is induced by the bulk Higgs
mechanism. The boundary condition is systematically solved up to the 6th order.
The Riemann curvature is finite everywhere. An exact solution for the no
potential case is also presented.
