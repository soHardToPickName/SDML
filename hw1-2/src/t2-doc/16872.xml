M-Theory, Torons and Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the decompactification limit of M-theory superpotentials for N=1
four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. These superpotentials can be
interpreted as generated by toron configurations. The connection with the
confinement picture in the maximal abelian gauge is discussed.
