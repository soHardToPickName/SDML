Kaluza-Klein Monopole in AdS Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct analogs of the flat space Kaluza-Klein monopoles in locally
Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spaces for D = 6. We show that unlike the flat space KK
monopole, there are no five dimensional static KK monopoles in AdS space. Thus,
one needs at least two extra dimensions, one of which is compact, to get a
static KK monopole for cosmological backgrounds.
