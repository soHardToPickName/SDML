y-Deformed BPS Dp- branes On a Surface In a Calabi-Yau Threefold
</title>

<abstract>
  Using y-deformed algebraic geometric techniques the y-deformed Mukay vector
of RR-charges of the y-deformed BPS Dp-branes localized on a surface in a
Calabi-Yau threefold. The formulas that are obtained here are generalizations
of the formulas of the fourth section of the preprint hep-th/0007243 .
