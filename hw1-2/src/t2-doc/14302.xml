  manifold with finite volume
</title>

<abstract>
  The functional determinant of Laplace-type operators on the 3-dimensional
non-compact hyperbolic manifold with invariant fundamental domain of finite
volume is computed by quadratures and making use of the related terms of the
Selberg trace formula.
