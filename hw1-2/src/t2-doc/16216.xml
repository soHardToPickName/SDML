AB and Berry phases for a quantum cloud of charge
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the phase accumulated by a charged particle in an extended
quantum state as it encircles one or more magnetic fluxons, each carrying half
a flux unit. A simple, essentially topological analysis reveals an interplay
between the Aharonov-Bohm phase and Berry's phase.
