Mirror Symmetry on Arbitrary Dimensional Calabi-Yau Manifold with a few
  moduli
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the B-model on the mirror pair of $X_{2N-2}(2,2,\cdots,2,1,1)$ ,
which is an $(N-2)$-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold and has two marginal
operators i.e. $h^{1,1}(X_{2N-2}(2,2,\cdots,2,1,1))=2$. In \cite{nagandjin} we
have discussed about mirror symmetry on $X_N(1,1,\cdots,1)$ and its mirror
pair. However, $X_N(1,1,\cdots,1)$ had only one moduli. In this paper we extend
its methods to the case with a few moduli using toric geometry.
