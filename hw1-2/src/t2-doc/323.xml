Remark on Pauli-Villars Lagrangian on the Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  It is interesting to superimpose the Pauli-Villars regularization on the
lattice regularization. We illustrate how this scheme works by evaluating the
axial anomaly in a simple lattice fermion model, the Pauli-Villars Lagrangian
with a gauge non-invariant Wilson term. The gauge non-invariance of the axial
anomaly, caused by the Wilson term, is remedied by a compensation among
Pauli-Villars regulators in the continuum limit. A subtlety in Frolov-Slavnov's
scheme for an odd number of chiral fermions in an anomaly free complex gauge
representation, which requires an infinite number of regulators, is briefly
mentioned.
