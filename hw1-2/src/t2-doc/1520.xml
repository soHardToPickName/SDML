String cosmology and relic gravitational radiaton
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory counterparts to Einstein's gravity, cosmology and inflation are
described. A very tight upper bound on the Cosmic Gravitational Radiation
Background (CGRB) of standard inflation is shown to be evaded in string
cosmology, while an interesting signal in the phenomenologically interesting
frequency range is all but excluded. The generic features of such a stringy
CGRB are presented.
