DYNAMICAL SUPERSYMMETRY
</title>

<abstract>
  We show, in a simple quantum mechanical model, how a theory can become
supersymmetric in the presence of interactions even when the free theory is
not. This dynamical generation of supersymmetry relaxes the condition on the
equality of masses of the superpartners which would be of phenomenological
interest.
