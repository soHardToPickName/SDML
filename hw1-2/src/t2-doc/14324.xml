Numerical Aspects of Bubble Nucleation
</title>

<abstract>
  Bubble nucleation has been studied on lattices using phenomenological
Langevin equations. Recently there have been theoretical motivations for using
these equations. These studies also conclude that the simple Langevin
description requires some modification. We study bubble nucleation on a lattice
and determine effects of the modified Langevin equations.
