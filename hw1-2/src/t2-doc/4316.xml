Self-Dual N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a large set of new self-dual N=1 SUSY gauge theories. Examples
include SU(N) theories with tensors and SO(N) theories with spinors. Using
these dualities as starting points, new non-trivial duals can be derived by
higgsing the gauge group or by integrating out matter. General lessons that can
be learned from these duals are: ``accidental" infrared symmetries play an
important role in duality, many theories have more than one ``dual", and there
seems to be no simple organizing pattern which relates duals of theories with
different number of flavors.
