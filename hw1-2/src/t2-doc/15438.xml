Newtonian versus black-hole scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss non-relativistic scattering by a Newtonian potential. We show that
the gray-body factors associated with scattering by a black hole exhibit the
same functional dependence as scattering amplitudes in the Newtonian limit,
which should be the weak-field limit of any quantum theory of gravity. This
behavior arises independently of the presence of supersymmetry. The connection
to two-dimensional conformal field theory is also discussed.
