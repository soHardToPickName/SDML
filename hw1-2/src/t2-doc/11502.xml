Some Additional Solutions of Conformal Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  We made a careful study of Polyakov's Diofantian equations for 2D turbulence
and found several additional CFTs which meet his criterion. This fact implies
that we need further conditions for CFT in order to determine the exponent of
the energy spectrum function.
