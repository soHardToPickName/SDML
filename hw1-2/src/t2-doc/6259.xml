Black holes as D3-branes on Calabi-Yau threefolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole can be obtained by
wrapping a dyonic D3-brane on a Calabi-Yau manifold. In the orbifold limit
T^6/Z_3, we explicitly show the correspondence between the solution of the
supergravity equations of motion and the D-brane boundary state description of
such a black hole.
