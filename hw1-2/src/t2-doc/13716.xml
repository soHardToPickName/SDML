On gravitational couplings in D-brane action
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the two closed string graviton - two open string scalar scattering
amplitude on the disc to show that there is no second-derivative curvature -
scalar coupling term R X^2 in the low-energy effective action of a D-brane in
curved space in type II superstring theory.
