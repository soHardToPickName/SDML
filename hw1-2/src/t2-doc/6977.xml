The Aharonov-Bohm Problem Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of a nonrelativistic charged particle in two dimensions in the
presence of an arbitrary number of nonquantized magnetic fluxes are
investigated in free space as well as in a uniform magnetic field. The fluxes
are represented mathematically as branch points in one of the complex
coordinates. It is found that in order to construct solutions, the fluxes have
to be treated in general as dynamical objects dual to the charges. A medium
made up of fluxes acts like an anti-magnetic field and tends to expel the
charges.
