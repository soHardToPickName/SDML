Theoretical analysis of a reported weak gravitational shielding effect
</title>

<abstract>
  Under special conditions (Meissner-effect levitation in a high frequency
magnetic field and rapid rotation) a disk of high-$T_c$ superconducting
material has recently been found to produce a weak shielding of the
gravitational field. We show that this phenomenon has no explanation in the
standard gravity theories, except possibly in the non-perturbative Euclidean
quantum theory.
