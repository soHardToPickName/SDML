The `BRST-invariant' Condensate of Dimension Two in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The status of the `BRST-invariant' condensate of mass dimension two in QCD is
explained. The condensate is only invariant under an `on-shell' BRST symmetry
which includes a partial gauge-fixing. The on-shell BRST symmetry represents
the residual gauge symmetry under gauge transformations which preserve the
partial gauge fixing. The gauge-invariant operators which correspond to the
BRST-invariant condensate are identified in the Lorentz and maximal Abelian
gauges and are shown to be invariant under the residual gauge transformations.
