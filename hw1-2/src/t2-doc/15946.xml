Implementing holographic projections in Ponzano--Regge gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the path-sum of Ponzano-Regge with additional boundary
contributions in the context of the holographic principle of Quantum Gravity.
We calculate an holographic projection in which the bulk partition function
goes to a semi-classical limit while the boundary state functional remains
quantum-mechanical. The properties of the resulting boundary theory are
discussed.
