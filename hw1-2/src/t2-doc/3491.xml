Brane Tensions and Coupling Constants from within M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Reviewing the cancellation of local anomalies of M-theory on R^10 x S^1/Z_2
the Yang-Mills coupling constant on the boundaries is rederived. The result is
lambda^2 = 2^(1/3) (2 pi) (4 pi kappa^2)^(2/3) corresponding to eta =
lambda^6/kappa^4 = 256 pi^5 in the `upstairs' units used by Horava and Witten
and differs from their calculation. It is shown that these values are
compatible with the standard membrane and fivebrane tensions derived from the
M-theory bulk action. In view of these results it is argued that the natural
units for M-theory on R^10 x S^1/Z_2 are the `downstairs' units where the brane
tensions take their standard form and the Yang-Mills coupling constant is
lambda^2 = 4 pi (4 pi kappa^2)^(2/3).
