Operator Product Expansions and Consistency Relations in a O(N)
  Invariant Fermionic CFT for 2<d<4
</title>

<abstract>
  A conformally invariant theory of Majorana fermions in 2<d<4 with O(N)
symmetry is studied using Operator Product Expansions and consistency relations
based on the cancellation of shadow singularities. The critical coupling G_{*}
of the theory is calculated to leading order in 1/N. This value is then used to
reproduce the O(1/N) correction for the anomalous dimension of the fermion
field as evidence for the validity of our approach to conformal field theory in
d>2.
