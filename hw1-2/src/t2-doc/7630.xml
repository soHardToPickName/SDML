Gauge Invariant Variational Approach with Fermions: the Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the gauge invariant variational approach of Phys. Rev. D52 (1995)
3719, hep-th/9408081, to theories with fermions. As the simplest example we
consider the massless Schwinger model in 1+1 dimensions. We show that in this
solvable model the simple variational calculation gives exact results.
