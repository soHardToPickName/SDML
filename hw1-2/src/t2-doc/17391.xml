Gauge Symmetry Breakdown due to Dynamical Higgs Scalar
</title>

<abstract>
  Assuming dynamical spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry for massless
gauge theory without scalar fields, we present a method how to construct an
effective action of the dynamical Nambu-Goldstone bosons and elemetary fermions
by using auxiliary fields. Here dynamical particles are asssumed to be composed
of elementary fermions. Various quantities including decay constants are
calculated from this effective action. This technique is also applied to gauge
symmetry breakdown, $SU(5)\to SU(4)$, to obtain massive gauge fields.
