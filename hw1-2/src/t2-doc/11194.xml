On Projective Gravity and the vanishing of the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize Einstein's Lagrangian in a non-polynomial (in R) way. The usual
Lagrangian (linear in R) is the zero $\alpha'$ limit of our theory, where
$\alpha'$ is a parameter that is interpreted as the inverse cosmological
costant before the Planck time. The theory space of this lagrangian admits a
${\bf Z_{2}}$ modular group, namely $R \leftrightarrow 1/R$. Independence of
the modular invariant expectation values from the number of `Big Bangs'
enforces a quantization condition for the cosmological constant. At the
semiclassical approximation we obtain $\Lambda =0$, and a vacuum equation which
is equivalent to inflation cosmology. D=4 and D=1 universes are obtained as
unique (and topologically separated by the D=2 semiclassical barrier) integer
dimension solutions. They correspond to the first excited level and the ground
state respectively of our projective gravity.
