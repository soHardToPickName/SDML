On the definiteness of the conformal anomaly in nonconformal gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  The critical dimension of the bosonic string in the harmonic and the deDonder
gauge may be calculated from the time ordered product of two energy momentum
tensors. We show that recently found ambiguities within that method in
nonconformal gauges can be resolved by a treatment respecting background
covariance.
