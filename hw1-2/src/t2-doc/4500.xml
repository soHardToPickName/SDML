Integrable Heisenberg-van Vleck chains with variable range exchange
</title>

<abstract>
  The review of recent results in the s=1/2 quantum spin chains with
$1/\sinh^2(\kappa r$ exchange is presented. Related problems in the theory of
classical and quantum Calogero-Sutherland-Moser systems with inverse square
hyperbolic and elliptic potentials are discussed. The attention is paid to
finding the explicit form of corresponding Bethe-Ansatz equations and to
connection with generalized Hubbard chains in one dimension.
