A note on inflationary string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  Cosmological solutions are obtained by continuation of black D-brane
solutions into the region between the horizons. It is investigated whether one
can find exponential expansion when probing the cosmology with D-branes. A
unique configuration exhibiting exponential expansion is discussed.
