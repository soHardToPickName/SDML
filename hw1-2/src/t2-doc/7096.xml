Mass Gap in Kaluza-Klein Spectrum in a Network of Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Newton's force law for brane world consisting of periodic
configuration of branes. We show that it supports a massless graviton.
Furthermore, this massless mode is well separated from the Kaluza-Klein
spectrum by a mass gap. Thus most of the problems in phenomenology coming from
continuum of Kaluza-Klein modes without mass gap are potentially cured in such
a model.
