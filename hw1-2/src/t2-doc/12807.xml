Some Remarks on Quantum Coherence
</title>

<abstract>
  There are many striking phenomena which are attributed to
  ``quantum coherence''. It is natural to wonder if there are new quantum
coherence effects waiting to be discovered which could lead to interesting
results and perhaps even practical applications. A useful starting point for
such discussions is a definition of ``quantum coherence''. In this article I
give a definition of quantum coherence and use a number of illustrations to
explore the implications of this definition. I point to topics of current
interest in the fields of cosmology and quantum computation where questions of
quantum coherence arise, and I emphasize the impact that interactions with the
environment can have on quantum coherence.
