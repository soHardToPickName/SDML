Random lattice strings vs. type IIB matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  I comment on a curious relation between Siegel's model of random lattice
strings and type IIB matrix model. The comparison of the two theories suggests
that there may exist extra terms in the latter which are overlooked in the weak
string coupling limit.
