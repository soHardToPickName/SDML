Higher Dimensional Schwinger-like Anomalous Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct explicit form of the anomalous effective action, in arbitrary
even dimension, for Abelian vector and axial gauge fields coupled to Dirac
fermions. It turns out to be a surprisingly simple extension of 2D Schwinger
model effective action.
