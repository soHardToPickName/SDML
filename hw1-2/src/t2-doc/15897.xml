Covariant $\kappa-$Symmetry Gauge Fixing and the Classical Relation
  Between Physical Variables of the NSR String and the Type II GS Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  The main goal of this paper is the manifestly covariant derivation of the
classical relation between the gauge-fixed Grassmann variables of the NSR
string and the Type II GS superstring. To this end we analyze the
superembedding equation for the Type II superstring to derive the relation
between the original variables of the NSR string and the Type II GS superstring
and, further, by means of Lorentz harmonic variables we fix $\kappa-$symmetry
of the GS superstring in the manifestly Lorentz covariant way.
