Chirality deconfinement beyond the $C=1$ barrier of two dimensional
  gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The characteristic novel features of strongly coupled gravity at the special
values ($C_L=7, 13, 19$) are reviewed in a simple manner using pictures as much
as possible. (Notes of lectures at the 1995 Cargese Meeting Low dimensional
applications of quantum field theory)
