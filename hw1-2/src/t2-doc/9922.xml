Boundary G/G theory and topological Poisson-Lie sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a boundary version of the gauged WZW model with a Poisson-Lie group
G as the target. The Poisson-Lie structure of G is used to define the
Wess-Zumino term of the action on surfaces with boundary. We clarify the
relation of the model to the topological Poisson sigma model with the dual
Poisson-Lie group G^* as the target and show that the phase space of the theory
on a strip is essentially the Heisenberg double of G introduced by
Semenov-Tian-Shansky
