Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau Theory in the Causal Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider the scalar sector of Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau theory in
the framework of Epstein-Glaser causal method. We calculate the lowest order
distributions for Compton scattering, vacuum polarization, self-energy and
vertex corrections. By requiring gauge invariance of the theory we recover, in
a natural way, the scalar propagator of the usual effective theory.
