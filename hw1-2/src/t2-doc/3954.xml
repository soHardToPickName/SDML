Black Hole Formation by Sine-Gordon Solitons in Two-dimensional Dilaton
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The CGHS model of two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to a sine-Gordon
matter field is considered. The theory is exactly solvable classically, and the
solutions of a kink and two-kink type solitons are studied in connection with
black hole formation.
