Stress Tensors in p-adic String Theory and Truncated OSFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the stress tensors for the p-adic string model and for the pure
tachyonic sector of open string field theory by naive metric covariantization
of the action. Then we give the concrete energy density of a lump solution of
the p-adic model. In the cubic open bosonic string field theory, we also give
the energy density of a lump solution and pressure evolution of a rolling
tachyon solution.
