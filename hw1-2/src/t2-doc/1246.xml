Quantum Cohomology at Higher Genus: Topological Recursion Relations and
  Virasoro Conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct topological recursion relations (TRR's) at higher genera $g\ge2$
for general 2-dimensional topological field theories coupled to gravity. These
TRR's when combined with Virasoro conditions enable one to determine the number
of higher genus holomorphic curves in any Fano varieties. In the case of $CP^2$
we reproduce the known results at genus $g=2$.
