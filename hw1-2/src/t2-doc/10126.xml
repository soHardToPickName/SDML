A q-Deformation of the Harmonic Oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  The q-deformed harmonic oscillator is studied in the light of q-deformed
phase space variables. This allows a formulation of the corresponding
Hamiltonian in terms of the ordinary canonical variables $x$ and $p$. The
spectrum shows unexpected features such as degeneracy and an additional part
that cannot be reached from the ground state by creation operators. The
eigenfunctions show lattice structure, as expected.
