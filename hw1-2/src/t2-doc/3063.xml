Lattice Approximation of Quantum Statistical Traces at a Complex
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that the simple condition on the potential V, \int exp(-t V) <
\infty for all t>0, is sufficient for the lattice approximation of the trace
Tr[A exp(-b H)] with (Re b)>0 to work for all bounded functions A and a large
class of potentials. As a by-product we obtain an explicit bound for the
real-temperature lattice kernels.
