On the fundamental structure of nature and the unification of forces
</title>

<abstract>
  A model for the fundamental structure of nature is presented. It is based on
two fundamental fermions moving with the velocity of light and differing from
each other by the projection of the spin on the momentum vector. The energy of
both fermions is proportional to the momentum, which is scaled inversely with
the size of a length quantum. All the known forces are a manifestation of one
elementary interaction, the spin exchange or spin flip-flop which takes place
when two different elementary fermions come together in the same space cell. At
this stage the model can explain the properties of the photon as a two-fermion
particle and it can be shown that the Dirac theory for relativistic fermions
could be deduced from this model. The model predicts that particles like the
electron or the quark are stable combinations of a large number of the
fundamental fermions, but proof of that prediction has not been given.
