The M five brane on a torus
</title>

<abstract>
  The D-3 brane is examined from the point of view of the wrapped M-theory five
brane on a torus. In particular, the S-dual versions of the 3-brane are
identified as coming from different gauge choices of the auxiliary field that
is introduced in the PST description of the five brane world volume theory.
