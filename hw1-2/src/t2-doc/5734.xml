Selection rules for splitting strings
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been pointed out that Nielsen-Olesen vortices may be able to decay by
pair production of black holes. We show that when the abelian Higgs model is
embedded in a larger theory, the additional fields may lead to selection rules
for this process - even in the absence of fermions - due to the failure of a
charge quantization condition. We show that, when there is topology change, the
criterion based on the charge quantization condition supplements the usual
criterion based on $\pi_0(H)$. In particular, we find that, unless
$2\sin^2\theta_W$ is a rational number, the thermal splitting of electroweak
Z-strings by magnetically neutral black holes is impossible, even though
$\pi_0(H)$ is trivial.
