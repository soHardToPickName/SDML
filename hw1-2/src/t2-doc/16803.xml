SU(N) Yang-Mills on a circle, loop variables, Mandelstam identities and
  quantization ambiguities
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills on a circle (cylindrical space-time) and
quantize the eigenvalues of the holonomy. In this way the Mandelstam identities
associated with the holonomy are trivially solved. Furthermore we indicate that
there are exactly two physically inequivalent representations of the algebra of
gauge-invariant operators, resulting in different spectra.
