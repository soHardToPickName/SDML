Remarks on the Atiyah-Hitchin metric
</title>

<abstract>
  We outline the construction of the Atiyah-Hitchin metric on the moduli space
of SU(2) BPS monopoles with charge 2, first as an algebraic curve in C^3
following Donaldson and then as a solution of the Toda field equations in the
continual large N limit. We adopt twistor methods to solve the underlying
uniformization problem, which by the generalized Legendre transformation yield
the Kahler coordinates and the Kahler potential of the metric. We also comment
on the connection between twistors and the Seiberg-Witten construction of
quantum moduli spaces, as they arise in three dimensional supersymmetric gauge
theories, and briefly address the uniformization of algebraic curves in C^3 in
the context of large N Toda theory. (Based on talks delivered in September 1998
at the 32nd International Symposium Ahrenshoop on the Theory of Elementary
Particles, Buckow; the 21st Triangular Meeting on Quantum Field Theory, Crete
and the TMR meeting on Quantum Aspects of Gauge Theories, Supersymmetry and
Unification, Corfu; to be published in the proceedings in Fortschritte der
Physik.)
