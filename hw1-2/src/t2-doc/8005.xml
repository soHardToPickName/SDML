Renormalization of non-locally regularized BRST-anti-BRST theories
</title>

<abstract>
  An extension of the non-local regularization scheme is formulated in the
Sp(2) symmetric Lagrangian BRST quantization framework. It generates a
systematic treatment of the anomalous quantum master equations and allows to
substract the divergences as well as to calculate genuine higher loop BRST and
anti-BRST anomalies.
