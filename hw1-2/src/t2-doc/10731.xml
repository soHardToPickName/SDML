Quantum Moduli Spaces of Linear and Ring Mooses
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum moduli spaces of four dimensional $SU(2)^{r}$ linear and ring moose
theories with $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry and link chiral superfields in the
fundamental representation are produced starting from simple pure gauge
theories of disconnected nodes.
