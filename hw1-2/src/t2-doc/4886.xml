Curing Fermion Mass Gauge Variance in QED$_{2+1}$
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of the gauge dependence of the fermion mass in the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons QED$_{2+1}$ is revisited. Using Proca mass term as an
intermediate infrared regulator we are demonstrating gauge-invariance of the
fermion mass shell in QED$_{2+1}$ in all orders of the perturbation theory.
