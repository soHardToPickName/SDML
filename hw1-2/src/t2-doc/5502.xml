Deriving exact prepotential for $N = 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
  theories from superconformal anomaly with rank two gauge groups
</title>

<abstract>
  The exact prepotential for $N = 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is
derived from the superconformal anomalous Ward identity for the gauge group
SU(2) and SU(3) which can be generalized to any other rank two gauge group.
