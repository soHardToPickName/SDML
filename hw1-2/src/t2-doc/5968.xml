A Class of String Backgrounds as a Semiclassical Limit of WZW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of string backgrounds associated with non semi-simple groups is
obtained as a special large level limit of ordinary WZW models. The models have
an integer Virasoro central charge and they include the background recently
studied by Nappi and Witten.
