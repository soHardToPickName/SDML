Solitons in 2+1 Dimensional Non-Commutative Maxwell Chern-Simons Higgs
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We find soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional non-commutative Maxwell
Chern-Simons Higgs theories. In the limit of the Chern-Simons coefficient going
to zero, these solutions go over to the previously found solutions in the
non-commutative Maxwell Higgs theories. The new solutions may have relevance in
the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect and possibly in string vacua
corresponding to open strings terminating on D2 branes in the presence of D0
branes.
