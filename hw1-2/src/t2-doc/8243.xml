Explicit construction of nilpotent covariants in N=4 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  Some aspects of correlation functions in N=4 SYM are discussed. Using N=4
harmonic superspace we study two and three-point correlation functions which
are of contact type and argue that these contact terms will not affect the
non-renormalisation theorem for such correlators at non-coincident points. We
then present a perturbative calculation of a five-point function at two loops
in N=2 harmonic superspace and verify that it reproduces the derivative of the
previously found four-point function with respect to the coupling. The
calculation of this four-point function via the five-point function turns out
to be significantly simpler than the original direct calculation. This
calculation also provides an explicit construction of an N=2 component of an
N=4 five-point nilpotent covariant that violates U(1)_Y symmetry.
