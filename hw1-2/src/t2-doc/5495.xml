The Witten Index Beyond the Adiabatic Approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  We attempt to deal with the orbifold singularities in the moduli space of
flat connections for supersymmetric gauge theories on the torus. At these
singularities the energy gap in the transverse fluctuations vanishes and the
resulting breakdown of the adiabatic approximation is resolved by considering
the full set of zero-momentum fields. These can not be defined globally, due to
the problem of Gribov copies. For this reason we restrict the fields to the
fundamental domain, containing no gauge copies, but requiring a boundary
condition in field space.
