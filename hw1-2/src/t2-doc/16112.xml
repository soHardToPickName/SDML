The phase transition in the multiflavour Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  A summary is given of a quantization of the multiflavour Schwinger model on a
finite-temperature cylinder with chirality-breaking boundary conditions at its
spatial ends, and it is shown that the analytic expression for the chiral
condensate implies that the theory exhibits a second order phase transition
with $T_c = 0$.
