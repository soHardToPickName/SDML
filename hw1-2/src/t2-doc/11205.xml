On Nahm's transformation with twisted boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  Following two different tracks, we arrive at a definition of Nahm's
transformation valid for self-dual fields on the 4-dimensional torus with
non-zero twist tensor.The transform is again a self-dual gauge field defined on
a new torus and with non-zero twist tensor. It preserves the property of being
an involution.
