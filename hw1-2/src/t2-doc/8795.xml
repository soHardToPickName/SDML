BRS Symmetry and Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRS symmetry determines physical states, Lagrange densities and candidate
anomalies. It renders gauge fixing unobservable in physical states and is
required if negative norm states are to decouple also in interacting models.
The relevant mathematical structures and the elementary cohomological
investigations are presented.
