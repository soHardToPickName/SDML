Global Properties of Exact Solutions in Integrable Dilaton-Gravity
  Models

  Global canonical transformations to free chiral fields are constructed for DG
models minimally coupled to scalar fields. The boundary terms for such
canonical transformations are shown to vanish in asymptotically static
coordinates if there is no scalar field.
