Stochastic Master Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We treat the stochastic equation for large N master fields proposed by
Greensite and Halpern using a construction of master fields modelled after work
of Voiculescu, and show that it contains the same information as the usual
factorized Schwinger-Dyson equations.
