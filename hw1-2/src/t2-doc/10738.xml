Large Parabosons versus supersymmetry in Jahn-Teller Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The applications of parabosons by Schmutz (1980) and of supersymmetry by
Jarvis {\em et al.} (1984) in Jahn-Teller systems are compared and contrasted.
Although a parasupersymmetric Jahn-Teller system has not yet been identified,
the method of Schmutz is used here to show that the $E \times \epsilon $
supersymmetric Jahn-Teller Hamiltonian can be written in terms of paraboson
operators.
