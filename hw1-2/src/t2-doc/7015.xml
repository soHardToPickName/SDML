Can the Unruh-DeWitt detector extract energy from the vacuum?
</title>

<abstract>
  The Unruh effect can be correctly treated only by using the Minkowski
quantization and a model of a "particle" detector, not by using the Rindler
quantization. The energy produced by a detector accelerated only for a short
time can be much larger than the energy needed to change the velocity of the
detector. Although the measuring process lasts an infinite time, the production
of the energy can be qualitatively explained by a time-energy uncertainty
relation.
