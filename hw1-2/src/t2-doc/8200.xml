Quantum Deformations of $\tau$-functions, Bilinear Identities and
  Representation Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper is a brief review of recent results on the concept of
``generalized $\tau$-function'', defined as a generating function of all the
matrix elements in a given highest-weight representation of a universal
enveloping algebra ${\cal G}$. Despite the differences from the particular case
of conventional $\tau$-functions of integrable (KP and Toda lattice)
hierarchies, these generic $\tau$-functions also satisfy bilinear Hirota-like
equations, which can be deduced from manipulations with intertwining operators.
The main example considered in details is the case of quantum groups, when such
$\tau$-``functions'' are not $c$-numbers but take their values in
non-commutative algebras (of functions on the quantum group $G$). The paper
contains only illustrative calculations for the simplest case of the algebra
SL(2) and its quantum counterpart $SL_q(2)$, as well as for the system of
fundamental representations of SL(n).
