Quantum discontinuity between zero and infinitesimal graviton mass with
  a Lambda term
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the recently demonstrated absence of the usual discontinuity for
massive spin 2 with a Lambda term is an artifact of the tree approximation, and
that the discontinuity reappears at one loop.
