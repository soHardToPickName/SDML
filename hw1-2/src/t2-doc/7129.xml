Some notes on string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We start from a quantum computational principle suggested for string theory
in a previous paper and discuss how it might lead to a dynamical principle
implying the correct classical gravitational limit. Besides this, we briefly
look at some structural properties of moduli space.
