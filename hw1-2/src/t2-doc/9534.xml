GUT's with Adjoint Higgs from Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss how effective grand unified theories requiring adjoint Higgs fields
for breaking to the standard model can be contained within string theory.
Initial findings are presented in a search for and classification of effective
three generation SO(10) SUSY-GUT models built using the free-fermionic string
approach. Based on talk presented at PASCOS '94, Syracuse, NY.
