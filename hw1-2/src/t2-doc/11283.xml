W-Strings on Group Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a procedure for constructing actions describing propagation of
W-strings on group manifolds by using the Hamiltonian canonical formalism and
representations of W-algebras in terms of Kac-Moody currents. An explicit
construction is given in the case of the $W_3$ string.
