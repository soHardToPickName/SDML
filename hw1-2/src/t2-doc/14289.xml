The Spacetime Superalgebras in a Massive IIA Background via Brane Probes
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the spacetime superalgebras explicitly from ``test'' p-brane
actions in a D-8-brane (i.e. a massive IIA) background to the lowest order in
$\theta$ via canonical formalism, and show that the forms of the superalgebras
are the same as those in all the other D-brane (i.e. massless IIA) backgrounds,
that is, they are indifferent to the presence of the Chern-Simons terms which
are proportional to the mass and added to the D-brane actions in the case of
massive IIA backgrounds. Thus, we can say that all the D-brane background
solutions including a D-8-brane are on equal footing from the viewpoint of the
superalgebras via brane probes. We also deduce from the algebra all the
previously known 1/4 supersymmetric intersections of a p-brane or a fundamental
string with a D-8-brane, as the supersymmetric ``gauge fixings'' of the test
branes in the D-8-brane background.
