Conformal Covariance Subalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a direct Lie algebraic characterisation of conformal inclusions of
chiral current algebras associated with compact, reductive Lie algebras. We use
straightforward quantum field theoretic arguments and prove a long standing
conjecture of Schellekens and Warner on grounds of unitarity and positivity of
energy. We explore the structures found to characterise ``conformal covariance
subalgebras'' and ``coset current algebras''.
