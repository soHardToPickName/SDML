Gauge Symmetry Breaking through the Hosotani Mechanism in Softly Broken
  Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge symmetry breaking through the Hosotani mechanism (the dynamics of
nonintegrable phases) in softly broken supersymmetric QCD with $N_F^{fd}$
flavors is studied. For $N=$ even, there is a single SU(N) symmetric vacuum
state, while for $N=$ odd, there is a doubly degenerate SU(N) symmetric vacuum
state in the model. We also study generalized supersymmetric QCD by adding
$N_F^{adj}$ numbers of massless adjoint matter. The gauge symmetry breaking
pattern such as $SU(3)\to SU(2)\times U(1)$ is possible for appropriate choices
of the matter content and values of the supersymmetry breaking parameter. The
massless state of the adjoint Higgs scalar is also discussed in the models.
