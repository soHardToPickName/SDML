The Light-Cone Effective Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to calculate simple vacuum diagrams in light-cone quantum
field theory. As an application, I consider the one-loop effective potential of
phi^4 theory. The standard result is recovered both with and without the
inclusion of zero modes having longitudinal momentum k^+ = 0.
