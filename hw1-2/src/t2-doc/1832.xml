Black holes with topologically nontrivial AdS asymptotics
</title>

<abstract>
  Asymptotically locally AdS black hole geometries of dimension d > 2 are
studied for nontrivial topologies of the transverse section. These geometries
are static solutions of a set of theories labeled by an integer 0 < k <
[(d-1)/2] which possess a unique globally AdS vacuum. The transverse sections
of these solutions are d-2 surfaces of constant curvature, allowing for
different topological configurations. The thermodynamic analysis of these
solutions reveals that the presence of a negative cosmological constant is
essential to ensure the existence of stable equilibrium states. In addition, it
is shown that these theories are holographically related to [(d-1)/2] different
conformal field theories at the boundary.
