A New Approach to Spin and Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an algebraic proof of the spin-statistics connection for the
parabosonic and parafermionic quantum topological charges of a theory of local
observables with a modular PCT-symmetry. The argument avoids the use of the
spinor calculus and also works in 1+2 dimensions. It is expected to be a
progress towards a general spin-statistics theorem including also
(1+2)-dimensional theories with braid group statistics.
