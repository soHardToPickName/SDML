A Possible Candidate for Dark Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of a new quantum field theory without divergence presented by us
we identify W-matter with dark matter and guess that the two new stars RXJ1865
and 3C58 and quasi-stellar objects are the compounds of a F-celestial body with
a W-celestial body with massive enough mass, and some earthquakes, some
tsunamis and some disasters in some areas like Bermuda are caused by W-objects.
Keywords: Dark matter; W-matter; Quasi-stellar objects.
