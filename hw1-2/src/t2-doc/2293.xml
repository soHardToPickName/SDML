The domain-wall/QFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the correspondence between adS-supergravities and superconformal
field theories on the adS boundary to a correspondence between gauged
supergravities (typically with non-compact gauge groups) and quantum field
theories on domain walls.
