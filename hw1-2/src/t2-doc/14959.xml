Rotating Kaluza-Klein Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  All regular four-dimensional black holes are constructed in the theory
obtained by Kaluza-Klein reduction of five-dimensional Einstein gravity. They
are interpreted in string theory as rotating bound states of D0- and D6-branes.
Conservation of angular momentum is important for the stability of the bound
states. The thermodynamics, the duality symmetries, and the near-horizon limit
are explored.
