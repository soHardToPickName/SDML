What's Wrong with Pauli-Villars Regularization in $QED_{3}$ ?
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we argue that there is no ambiguity between the Pauli-Villars
and other methods of regularization in (2+1)-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics with respect to dynamical mass generation, provided we properly
choose the couplings for the regulators.
