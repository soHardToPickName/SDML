Free Fields for Any Spin in 1+2 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct free fields of arbitrary spin in 1+2 dimensions i.e. free fields
for which the one-particle Hilbert space carries a projective isometric
irreducible representation of the Poincar\'e group in 1+2 dimensions. We
analyse in detail these representations in the fiber bundle formalism and
afterwards we apply Weinberg procedure to construct the free fields. Some
comments concerning axiomatic field theory in 1+2 dimensions are also made.
