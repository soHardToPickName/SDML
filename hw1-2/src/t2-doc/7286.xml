Spin Content of the Quantum Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical soliton solution, quantized by means of suitable translational
and rotational collective coordinates, is embedded into the one-particle
irreductible representation of the Poincare group corresponding to a definite
spin. It is shown, that within the conventional quasiclassical expansion such
embedding leads to a set of nontrivial consistency conditions imposed on the
classical solution. The validity of these relations is considered for a number
of soliton models in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions.
