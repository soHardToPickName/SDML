Algebraic Shape Invariant Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the shape invariance condition in supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, we develop an algebraic framework for shape invariant Hamiltonians
with a general change of parameters. This approach involves nonlinear
generalizations of Lie algebras. Our work extends previous results showing the
equivalence of shape invariant potentials involving translational change of
parameters with standard $SO(2,1)$ potential algebra for Natanzon type
potentials.
