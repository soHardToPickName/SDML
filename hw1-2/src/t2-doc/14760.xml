Integral Transforms for Conformal Field Theories with a Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method is developed for solving the conformally invariant integrals
that arise in conformal field theories with a boundary. The presence of a
boundary makes previous techniques for theories without a boundary less
suitable. The method makes essential use of an invertible integral transform,
related to the radon transform, involving integration over planes parallel to
the boundary. For successful application of this method several nontrivial
hypergeometric function relations are also derived.
