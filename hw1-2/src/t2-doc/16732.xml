On W_3-morphisms and the Geometry of Plane Curves
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a description of W_3 transformations in terms of deformations of
convex curves in two dimensional Euclidean space. This geometrical
interpretation sheds some light on the nature of finite W_3-morphisms. We also
comment on how this construction can be extended to the case of W_n and
``nicely curved'' curves in $\reals^{n-1}$.
