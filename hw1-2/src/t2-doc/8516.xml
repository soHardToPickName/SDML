Iterative Solution of the Supereigenvalue Model
</title>

<abstract>
An integral form of the discrete superloop equations for the supereigenvalue
model of Alvarez-Gaume, Itoyama, Manes and Zadra is given. By a change of
variables from coupling constants to moments we find a compact form of the
planar solution for general potentials. In this framework an iterative scheme
for the calculation of higher genera contributions to the free energy and the
multi-loop correlators is developed. We present explicit results for genus one.
