The standard model in noncommutative geometry and fermion doubling
</title>

<abstract>
  The link between chirality in the fermion sector and (anti-)self-duality in
the boson sector is reexamined in the light of Connes' noncommutative geometry
approach to the Standard Model. We find it to impose that the noncommutative
Yang-Mills action be symmetrized in an analogous way to the Dirac-Yukawa
operator itself.
