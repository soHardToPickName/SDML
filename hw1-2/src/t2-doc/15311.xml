Nonlinear Sigma Models and Symplectic Geometry on Loop Spaces of
  (Pseudo)Riemannian Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider symplectic and Hamiltonian structures of systems
generated by actions of sigma-model type and show that these systems are
naturally connected with specific symplectic geometry on loop spaces of
Riemannian and (pseudo)Riemannian manifolds.
