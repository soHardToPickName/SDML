  We explicitly evaluate the disk S-matrix elements of one closed string and an
arbitrary number of open string states in the presence of a large background
B-flux. From this calculation, we show that in the world-volume action of
D-branes in terms of non-commutative fields, the closed string fields must be
treated as functionals of the non-commutative gauge fields. We also find the
generalized multiplication rule *_N between N open string fields on the
world-volume of the D-brane. In particular, this result indicates that the
difference between the familiar * and the *_N product is just some total
derivative terms. We show that the *_N product and the dependence of the closed
string fields on the non-commutative gauge fields emerge also from transforming
the ordinary Dirac-Born-Infeld action(including the closed string fields) under
the Seiberg-Witten map. We then conjecture a non-commutative DBI action for the
transformation of the commutative DBI action under the SW map.
