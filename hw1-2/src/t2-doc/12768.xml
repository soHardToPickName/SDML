Free field realization of $q$-deformed primary fields for
  $U_q(\widehat{\sl}_2)$

  The $q$-vertex operators of Frenkel and Reshetikhin are studied by means of a
$q$-deformation of the Wakimoto module for the quantum affine algebra
$U_q(\widehat{\sl}_2)$ at an arbitrary level $k\ne 0,-2$. A Fock module version
of the $q$-deformed primary field of spin $j$ is introduced, as well as the
screening operators which (anti-)commute with the action of
$U_q(\widehat{\sl}_2)$ up to a total difference of a field. A proof of the
intertwining property is given for the $q$-vertex operators corresponding to
the primary fields of spin $j\notin {1 \over2}\Z_{\geq0}$, which is enough to
treat a general case. A sample calculation of the correlation function is also
given.
