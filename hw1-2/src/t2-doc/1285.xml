Instantons on noncommutative R^4, and (2,0) superconformal six
  dimensional theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the resolution of moduli space of ideal instantons parameterizes
the instantons on non-commutative $\IR^{4}$. This moduli space appears as a
Higgs branch of the theory of $k$ $D0$-branes bound to $N$ $D4$-branes by the
expectation value of the $B$ field. It also appears as a regularized version of
the target space of supersymmetric quantum mechanics arising in the light cone
description of $(2,0)$ superconformal theories in six dimensions.
