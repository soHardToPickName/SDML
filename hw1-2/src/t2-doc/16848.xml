Laurent Series Representation for the Open Superstring Free Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  Open superstrings at non-zero temperature are considered. A novel
representation for the free energy (Laurent series representation) is
constructed. It is shown that the Hagedorn temperature arises in this formalism
as the convergence condition (specifically, the radius of convergence) of the
Laurent series.
