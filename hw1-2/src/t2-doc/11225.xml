Large angular momentum closed strings colliding with D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate colliding processes of closed strings with large angular
momenta with D-branes. We give explicit CFT calculations for closed string
states with an arbitrary number of bosonic excitations and no or one fermion
excitation. The results reproduce the correspondence between closed string
states and single trace operators in the boundary gauge theory recently
suggested by Berenstein, Maldacena and Nastase.
