Supersymmetric Structure of the Bosonic String Theory in the Beltrami
  Parametrization
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the bosonic string theory quantized in the Beltrami
parametrization possesses a supersymmetric structure like the
vector-supersymmetry already observed in topological field theories.
