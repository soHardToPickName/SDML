Microscopic universality in random matrix models of QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  I shall present a proof of universality of the microscopic spectral
correlations in Verbaarschot's random matrix models of QCD, to corroborate the
beautiful agreement between the predictions from the gaussian model and the
numerical data. Rather than following closely the original proof, I shall
disguise it with the conventional approach of Q, P operators and with the
method employed in an alternative proof by Kanzieper-Freilikher, in a hope that
borrowing notions from quantum mechanics may add the proof some pedagogical
flavor. I shall also discuss a problem associated with the multi-criticality.
