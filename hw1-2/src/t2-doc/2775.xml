Electroweak Theory and Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The noncommutative generalisation of the standard electroweak model due to
Balakrishna, Gursey and Wali is formulated in terms of the derivations
Der_2(M_3) of a three dimensional representation of the su(2) Lie algebra of
weak isospin. A light Higgs boson of mass about 130 GeV, together with four
very heavy scalar bosons are predicted.
