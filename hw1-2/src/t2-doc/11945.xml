BRS symmetry restoration of chiral Abelian Higgs-Kibble theory in
  dimensional renormalization with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$

<abstract>
  The one-loop renormalization of the abelian Higgs-Kibble model in a general
't Hooft gauge and with chiral fermions is fully worked out within dimensional
renormalization scheme with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$. The anomalous terms
introduced in the Slavnov-Taylor identities by the minimal subtraction
algorithm are calculated and the asymmetric counterterms needed to restore the
BRS symmetry, if the anomaly cancellation conditions are met, are computed. The
computations draw heavily from regularized action principles and Algebraic
Renormalization theory.
