Symmetries of the Kadomstev-Petviashvili Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between the $\widehat{\Sl}(\infty)$ algebra of flows commuting
with the KP hierarchy and the Kac-Moody-Virasoro Lie point symmetries of
individual equations is established. This is used to calculate the point
symmetries for all equations in the hierarchy.
