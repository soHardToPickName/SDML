Gauge Symmetries of the Master Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the geometry of the Lagrangian Batalin--Vilkovisky theory on an
antisymplectic manifold. We show that gauge symmetries of the BV-theory are
essentially the symmetries of an even symplectic structure on the stationary
surface of the master action.
