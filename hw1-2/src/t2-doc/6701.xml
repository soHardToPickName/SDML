Boundary bound states and boundary bootstrap in the sine-Gordon model
  with Dirichlet boundary conditions.

<abstract>
We present a complete study of boundary bound states and related boundary
S-matrices for the sine-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our
approach is based partly on the bootstrap procedure, and partly on the explicit
solution of the inhomogeneous XXZ model with boundary magnetic field and of the
boundary Thirring model. We identify boundary bound states with new ``boundary
strings'' in the Bethe ansatz. The boundary energy is also computed.
