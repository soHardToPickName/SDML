IRREDUCIBLE GAUGE THEORIES IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE Sp(2)-COVARIANT
  QUANTIZATION METHOD
</title>

<abstract>
  Irreducible gauge theories in both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian versions of
the Sp(2)-covariant quantization method are studied. Solutions to generating
equations are obtained in the form of expansions in power series of ghost and
auxiliary variables up to the 3d order inclusively.
