Matrix Models in Homogeneous Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate non-commutative gauge theories in homogeneous spaces G/H. We
construct such theories by adding cubic terms to IIB matrix model which contain
the structure constants of G. The isometry of a homogeneous space, G must be a
subgroup of SO(10) in our construction. We investigate CP^2=SU(3)/U(2) case in
detail which gives rise to 4 dimensional non-commutative gauge theory. We show
that non-commutative gauge theory on R^4 can be realized in the large N limit
by letting the action approach IIB matrix model in a definite way. We discuss
possible relevances of these theories to the large N limit of IIB matrix model.
