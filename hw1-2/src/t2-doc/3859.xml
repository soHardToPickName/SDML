Vortex induced confinement and the IR properties of Green functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theory are used to establish a relation
between the IR properties of Green functions and confinement. Using Landau
gauge where the gauge configurations are restricted to the first Gribov regime,
results on the ghost-, gluon form-factor and the running coupling constant are
presented. Finally, we discuss the behavior of the ghost form-factor of the
de-confined phase at high temperatures.
