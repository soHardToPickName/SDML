The Kosterlitz-Thouless Phenomenon on a Fluid Random Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of a periodic scalar field on a two-dimensional dynamical random
lattice is studied with the inclusion of vortices in the action. Using a random
matrix formulation, in the continuum limit for genus zero surfaces the
partition function is found exactly, as a function of the chemical potential
for vortices of unit winding number, at a specific radius in the plasma phase.
This solution is used to describe the Kosterlitz- Thouless phenomenon in the
presence of 2D quantum gravity as one passes from the ultra-violet to the
infra-red.
