Dynamics of the Cosmological Constant in Two-Dimensional Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a two-dimensional model of gravity with the cosmological constant
as a dynamical variable. The effective cosmological constant is derived when
the universe has no initial boundary. It turns out to be extremely small if the
universe is sufficiently large.
