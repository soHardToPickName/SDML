Extended phase space for a spinning particle
</title>

<abstract>
  Extended phase space of an elementary (relativistic) system is introduced in
the spirit of the Souriau's definition of the `space of motions' for such
system. Our formulation is generally applicable to any homogeneous space-time
(e.g. de Sitter) and also to Poisson actions. Calculations concerning the
Minkowski case for non-zero spin particles show an intriguing alternative: we
should either accept two-dimensional trajectories or (Poisson) noncommuting
space-time coordinates.
