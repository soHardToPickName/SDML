Essay on the Non-Maxwellian Theories of Electromagnetism
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first part of this paper we review several formalisms which give
alternative ways for describing the light. They are: the formalism `baroque'
and the Majorana-Oppenheimer form of electrodynamics, the Sachs' theory of
Elementary Matter, the Dirac-Fock-Podol'sky model, its development by
Staruszkiewicz, the Evans-Vigier ${\bf B}^{(3)}$ field, the theory with an
invariant evolution parameter of Horwitz, the analysis of the
action-at-a-distance concept, presented recently by Chubykalo and
Smirnov-Rueda, and the analysis of the claimed `longitudity' of the
antisymmetric tensor field after quantization. The second part is devoted to
the discussion of the Weinberg formalism and its recent development by
Ahluwalia and myself.
