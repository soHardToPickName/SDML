Lagrangians for the W-Algebra Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The field algebra of the minimal models of W-algebras is amenable to a very
simple description as a polynomial algebra generated by few elementary fields,
corresponding to order parameters. Using this description, the complete
Landau-Ginzburg lagrangians for these models are obtained. Perturbing these
lagrangians we can explore their phase diagrams, which correspond to
multicritical points with $D_n$ symmetry. In particular, it is shown that there
is a perturbation for which the phase structure coincides with that of the IRF
models of Jimbo et al.
