<title>
A Generalization of Quantum Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new fractional statistics for arbitrary dimensions, based on an
extension of Pauli's exclusion principle, to allow for finite multi-occupancies
of a single quantum state. By explicitly constructing the many-body Hilbert
space, we obtain a new algebra of operators and a new thermodynamics. The new
statistics is different from fractional exclusion statistics; and in a certain
limit, it reduces to the case of parafermi statistics.
