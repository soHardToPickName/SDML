Equivalence between Schwinger and Dirac schemes of quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper introduces the modified version of Schwinger's quantization
method, in which the information on constraints and the choice of gauge
conditions are included implicitly in the choice of variations used in
quantization scheme. A proof of equivalence between Schwinger- and
Dirac-methods for constraint systems is given.
