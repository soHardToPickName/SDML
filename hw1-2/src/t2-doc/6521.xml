Symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms
</title>

<abstract>
  No-go theorems on gauge-symmetry-deforming interactions of chiral p-forms are
reviewed. We consider the explicit case of p=4, D=10 and show that the only
symmetry-deforming consistent vertex for a system of one chiral 4-form and two
2-forms is the one that occurs in the type II B supergravity Lagrangian.
