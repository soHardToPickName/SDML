Spherical Functions for the Quantum Group su_q(2)
</title>

<abstract>
  The representation theory of the quantum group su$_q(2)$ is used to introduce
$q$-analogues of the Wigner rotation matrices, spherical functions, and
Legendre polynomials. The method amounts to an extension of variable separation
from Laplace equations to certain differential-dilation equations.
