Quantum Field Theory without Divergences: Quantum Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  A fundamental length is introduced into physics in a way which respects the
principles of relativity and quantum field theory. This improves the properties
of quantum field theory: divergences are removed. How to quantize gravity is
also indicated. When the fundamental length tends to zero the present version
of quantum field theory is recovered.
