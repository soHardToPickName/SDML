A generating formulation for free higher spin massless fields
</title>

<abstract>
  An action describing the dynamics of an infinite collection of massless
integer spin fields with spin s=0,1,2,3, ...$\infty$ corresponding to totally
symmetric Young tableaux representations of Poincare and anti-de Sitter groups
is constructed, in any dimension d, in terms of two functions on a
2d-dimensional manifold. The action is represented by an integral localized on
a 2d-1-dimensional hypersurface.
