New boundary conditions for integrable lattices

  New boundary conditions for integrable nonlinear lattices of the XXX type,
such as the Heisenberg chain and the Toda lattice are presented. These
integrable extensions are formulated in terms of a generic XXX Heisenberg
magnet interacting with two additional spins at each end of the chain. The
construction uses the most general rank 1 ansatz for the 2x2 L-operator
satisfying the reflection equation algebra with rational r-matrix. The
associated quadratic algebra is shown to be the one of dynamical symmetry for
the A1 and BC2 Calogero-Moser problems. Other physical realizations of our
quadratic algebra are also considered.
