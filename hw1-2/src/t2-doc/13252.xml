Baryons as Solitons in Three Dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that baryons of three dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics can be
understood as solitons of its effective lagrangian. In the parity preserving
phase we study, these baryons are fermions for odd $N_c$ and bosons for even
$N_c$, never anyons. We quantize the collective variables of the solitons and
there by calculate the flavor quantum numbers, magnetic moments and mass
splittings of the baryon. The flavor quantum numbers are in agreement with
naive quark model for the low lying states. The magnetic moments and mass
splittings are smaller in the soliton model by a factor of $\log {F_\pi\over
N_c m_\pi}$. We also show that there is a dibaryon solution that is an analogue
of the deuteron. These solitons can describe defects in a quantum
anti--ferromagnet.
