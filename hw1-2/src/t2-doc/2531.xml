Renormalization of noncommutative Yang-Mills theories: A simple example
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove by explicit calculation that Feynman graphs in noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory made of repeated insertions into itself of arbitrarily many
one-loop ghost propagator corrections are renormalizable by local counterterms.
This provides a strong support for the renormalizability conjecture of that
model.
