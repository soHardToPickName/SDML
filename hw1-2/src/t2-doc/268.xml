On dilaton dependence of type II superstring action
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric action of type IIA D=10 superstring in N=2a, D=10
supergravity background can be derived by double dimensional reduction of the
action of supermembrane coupled to D=11 supergravity. We demonstrate that the
background Ramond-Ramond fields appear in the resulting superstring action with
an extra factor of exponential of the dilaton.
