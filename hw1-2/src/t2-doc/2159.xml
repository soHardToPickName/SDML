$w_{\infty}$-Currents in 3-Dimensional Toda Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral densities obeying a $w_{\infty}$ Poisson--bracket algebra are
constructed for the $2+1\,\, A_{\infty}$ -- Toda field theory, using its
alternative $w_{\infty}$ -- Toda representation. They are obtained from formal
traces of powers of the Lax operator. The spin 2 and 3 currents are explicitely
derived, and the consistency of their Poisson algebra is checked.
