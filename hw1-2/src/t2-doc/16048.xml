String Representation of the Abelian Higgs Model with an Axionic
  Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  Making use of the duality transformation, we construct string representation
for the partition function of the London limit of Abelian Higgs Model with an
additional axionic term. In the lowest order of perturbation theory, this term
leads to the appearance in the resulting string effective action of a new
threelocal interaction between the elements of the string world-sheet.
Consequently, there emerges a threelocal correlator of the dual field strength
tensors, which does not contain the average over world-sheets, and is therefore
nontrivial even in the sector of the theory with a single small vortex. The
relation between the obtained correlator and the bilocal one is established.
Finally, it is argued that the vacuum structure of the London limit of the
Abelian Higgs Model with an additional axionic interaction is much more similar
to that of gluodynamics rather than without this interaction.
