On the Quantum Moduli Space of N=2 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Families of hyper-elliptic curves which describe the quantum moduli spaces of
vacua of $N=2$ supersymmetric $SO(N_c)$ gauge theories coupled to $N_f$ flavors
of quarks in the vector representation are constructed. The quantum moduli
spaces for $2N_f < N_c-1$ are determined completely by imposing $R$-symmetry,
instanton corrections and the proper classical singularity structure. These
curves are verified by residue calculations. The quantum moduli spaces for
$2N_f\geq N_c-1$ theories are parameterized and their general structure is
worked out using residue calculations. The exact metrics on the quantum moduli
spaces as well as the exact spectrum of stable massive states are derived. The
results presented here together with recent results of Martinec and Warner
provide a natural conjecture for the form of the curves for the other gauge
groups.
