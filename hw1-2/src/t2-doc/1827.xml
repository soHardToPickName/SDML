More About the Massive Multi-flavor Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The massive multi-flavor Schwinger model on a circle is reduced to a finite
dimensional quantum mechanics problem. The model sensitively depends on the
parameter $mL|\cos\onehalf\theta|$ where $m$, $L$, and $\theta$ are a typical
fermion mass, the volume, and the vacuum angle, respectively.
