All-orders finite $N=1$ super-Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I present a criterion for all-order finiteness in $N=1$ SYM theories. The
structure of the supercurrent anomaly, the Callan-Symanzik equation and the
supersymmetric non-renormalization theorem for chiral anomalies are the
essential ingredients of the proof.
