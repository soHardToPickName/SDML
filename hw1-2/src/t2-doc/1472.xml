One-Loop Quadratic Divergences of the Dual Non-Linear Sigma Model in
  Four-Dimensional Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Following a review of the dual description of the non-linear sigma model we
investigate the one-loop quadratic divergences. We use the covariant background
field method for the general case and apply the results to the important
example of $SU(2)$.
