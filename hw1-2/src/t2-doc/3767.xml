On Effective Superpotentials in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Effective superpotentials are considered which include glueball chiral
superfields among their arguments in supersymmetric gauge theories. It is seen
that the accommodation of glueball superfields is suitable for their complete
determination.
