Protected Operators in N=2,4 Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The anomalous dimension of single and multi-trace composite operators of
scalar fields is shown to vanish at all orders of the perturbative series. The
proof hold for theories with N=2 supersymmetry with any number of
hypermultiplets in a generic representation of the gauge group. It then applies
to the finite N=4 theory as well as to non conformal N=2 models.
