The Gravity dual of the Non-Perturbative $ N = 2 $ SUSY Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The anomalous Ward identity is derived for $N = 2$ SUSY Yang-Mills theories,
which is resulted out of Wrapping of $D_5$ branes on Supersymmetric two cycles.
  From the Ward identity One obtains the Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde
equation and hence can solve for the pre-potential. This way one avoids the
problem of enhancon which maligns the non-perturbative behaviour of the
Yang-Mills theory resulted out of Wrapped branes.
