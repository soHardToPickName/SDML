Ward - Takahashi identities and Noether's theorem in quantum field
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A gap in the mathematical logic in derivations in quantum field theory arises
as consequence of variation before quantization. To close this gap the present
paper introduces a mathematically rigorous variational calculus for operator
fields. Using quantization before variation it is demonstrated that the
so-called naive results are correct; in particular both Noether's theorem and
the Ward-Takahashi identities retain full validity in quantum field theory.
