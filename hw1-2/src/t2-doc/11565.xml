New strings with world-sheet supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a new model of string theory with world-sheet supersymmetry. It
possesses an additional global fermionic symmetry which is similar in many ways
to BRST symmetry. The spectrum consists of massless states of Rarita-Schwinger
fields describing infinite tower of half-integer spins.
