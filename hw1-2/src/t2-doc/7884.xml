Free fields via canonical transformations of matter-coupled 2D dilaton
  gravity models
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the 1+1-dimensional matter-coupled Jackiw-Teitelboim model
and the model with an exponential potential can be converted by means of
appropriate canonical transformations into a bosonic string theory propagating
on a flat target space with an indefinite signature. This makes it possible to
consistently quantize these models in the functional Schroedinger
representation thus generalizing recent results on CGHS theory.
