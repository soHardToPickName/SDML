About the Poisson Structure for D4 Spinning String
</title>

<abstract>
  The model of D4 open string with non-Grassmann spinning variables is
considered. The non-linear gauge, which is invariant both Poincar\'e and scale
transformations of the space-time, is used for subsequent studies. It is shown
that the reduction of the canonical Poisson structure from the original phase
space to the surface of constraints and gauge conditions gives the degenerated
Poisson brackets. Moreover it is shown that such reduction is non-unique. The
conseption of the adjunct phase space is introduced. The consequences for
subsequent quantization are discussed. Deduced dependence of spin $J$ from the
square of mass $\mu^2$ of the string generalizes the ''Regge spectrum`` for
conventional theory.
