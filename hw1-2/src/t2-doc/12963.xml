A Note on Background Independence in Noncommutative Gauge Theories,
  Matrix Model and Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the construction of D-branes with nonzero $B$ field in the matrix model
we give a physical interpretation of the known background independence in gauge
theories on a noncommutative space. The background independent variables are
identified as the degrees of freedom of the underlying matrix model. This
clarifies and extends some recent results about the end point of tachyon
condensation in D-branes with a $B$ field. We also explain the freedom in the
description which is parametrized by a two form $\Phi$ from the points of view
of the noncommutative geometry on the worldvolume of the branes, and of the
first quantized string theory.
