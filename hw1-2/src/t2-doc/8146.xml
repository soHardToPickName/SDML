Duality in N=2 nonlinear sigma-models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=2 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma-models in two dimensions
defined in terms of the nonminimal scalar multiplet. We compute in superspace
the one-loop beta function and show that the classical duality between these
models and the standard ones defined in terms of chiral superfields is
maintained at the quantum one-loop level. Our result provides an explicit
application of the recently proposed quantization of the nonminimal scalar
multiplet via the Batalin-Vilkovisky procedure.
