Matrix String Theory As A Generalized Quantum Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Matrix String Theory of Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind can be
understood as a generalized quantum theory (provisionally named "quansical"
theory) which differs from Adler's generalized trace quantum dynamics. The
effective Matrix String Theory Hamiltonian is constructed in a particular
fermionic realization of Matrix String Theory treated as an example of
"quansical" theory.
