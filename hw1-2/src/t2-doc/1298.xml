Black Holes and Solitons in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this review, I discuss a general method for constructing classical
solutions of the equations of motion arising in the effective low energy string
theory, and discuss specific applications of this method. (Based on talks given
at the Johns Hopkins Workshop held at Goteborg, June 8-10, 1992, and ICTP
Summer Workshop held at Trieste, July 2-3, 1992)
