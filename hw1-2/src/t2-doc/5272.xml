Differential Equations Associated to The SU(2) WZNW Model on Elliptic
  Curves
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the $SU(2)$ WZNW model over a family of elliptic curves. Starting
from the formulation developed by Tsuchiya, Ueno and Yamada, we derive a system
of differential equations which contains the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard
equations. Our system completely determines the $N$-point functions and it is
regarded as a natural elliptic analogue of the one developed by Tsuchiya and
Kanie for the projective line. We also calculate the system for the 1-point
functions explicitly. This gives a generalization of the system for
$\hat\frak{sl}(2,\C)$-characters derived by Eguchi and Ooguri.
