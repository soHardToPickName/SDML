Supersymmetry and the Geometry of Taub-NUT
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric extension of Taub-NUT space admits 4 standard
supersymmetries plus several additional non-standard ones. The geometrical
origin of these symmetries is traced. The result has applications to fermion
modes in gravitational instantons as well as in long-range monopole dynamics.
