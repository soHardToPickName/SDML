String Theory Origins of Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The string theory introduced in early 1971 by Ramond, Neveu, and myself has
two-dimensional world-sheet supersymmetry. This theory, developed at about the
same time that Golfand and Likhtman constructed the four-dimensional
super-Poincar\'e algebra, motivated Wess and Zumino to construct supersymmetric
field theories in four dimensions. Gliozzi, Scherk, and Olive conjectured the
spacetime supersymmetry of the string theory in 1976, a fact that was proved
five years later by Green and myself.
