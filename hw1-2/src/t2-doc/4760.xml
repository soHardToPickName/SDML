Schwinger model on a half-line
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Schwinger model on a half-line in this paper. In particular, we
investigate the behavior of the chiral condensate near the edge of the line.
The effect of the chosen boundary condition is emphasized. The extension to the
finite temperature case is straightforward in our approach.
