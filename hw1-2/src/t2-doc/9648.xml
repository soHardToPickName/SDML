  $\phi^4$-trajectory in three dimensions

  We study the invariant unstable manifold of the trivial renormalization group
fixed point tangent to the $\phi^{4}$-vertex in three dimensions. We
parametrize it by a running $\phi^{4}$-coupling with linear step
$\beta$-function. It is shown to have a renormalized double expansion in the
running coupling and its logarithm.
