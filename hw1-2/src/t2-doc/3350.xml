Algebraic Solution of the Supersymmetric Hydrogen Atom in d Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the Schroedinger
Hamiltonian with 1/r-potential in arbitrary space-dimensions is constructed.
The supersymmetric hydrogen atom admits a conserved Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector
which extends the rotational symmetry SO(d) to a hidden SO(d+1) symmetry. This
symmetry of the system is used to determine the discrete eigenvalues with their
degeneracies and the corresponding bound state wave functions.
