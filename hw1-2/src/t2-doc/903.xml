Connecting Green's Functions in an Arbitrary Pair of Gauges and an
  Application to Planar Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish a finite field-dependent BRS transformation that connects the
Yang-Mills path-integrals with Faddeev-Popov effective actions for an arbitrary
pair of gauges F and F'. We establish a result that relates an arbitrary
Green's function [either a primary one or one that of an operator] in an
arbitrary gauge F' to those in gauge F that are compatible to the ones in gauge
F by its construction [in that the construction preserves expectation values of
gauge-invariant observables]. We establish parallel results also for the planar
gauge-Lorentz gauge connection.
