U-duality of Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory compactified on a three-torus possesses an SL(5,Z) U-duality
group. We investigate the realisation of this symmetry on the Born-Infeld
theory on a three-brane, and discuss a U-duality covariant formulation of the
BPS sector of the theory where the rank of the gauge group is treated on an
equal footing with the fluxes.
