<abstract>
  Fixed angle scattering at high energy in a string theory with boundaries
satisfying Dirichlet conditions (Dirichlet strings) in $D=4$ is shown to have
logarithmic dependence on energy, in addition to the power-like behavior known
before. High temperature free energy also depends logarithmically on
temperature. Such a result could provide a matching mechanism between strings
at long distance and asymptotic freedom at short distance, which is necessary
for the reformulation of large-$N$ QCD as a string theory.
