Noncovariant Gauges in Simple Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A gauge-averaging functional of the axial type is studied for simple
supergravity at one loop about flat Euclidean four-space bounded by a
three-sphere, or two concentric three-spheres. This is a generalization of
recent work on the axial gauge in quantum supergravity on manifolds with
boundary. Ghost modes obey nonlocal boundary conditions of the spectral type,
in that half of them obey Dirichlet or Neumann conditions at the boundary. In
both cases, they give a vanishing contribution to the one-loop divergence. The
admissibility of noncovariant gauges at the classical level is also proved.
