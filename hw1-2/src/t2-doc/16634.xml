The Instanton Universal Moduli Space of N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the recursive structure of the compactification of the instanton
moduli space of N=2 Super Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2), to
construct, by inductive limit, a universal moduli space which includes all the
multi-instanton moduli spaces. Furthermore, with the aim of understanding the
field theoretic structure of the strong coupling expansion, we perform the
Borel sum which acts on the parameter defining such a universal moduli space.
