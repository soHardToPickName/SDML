Schwinger- Dyson Equations and Dynamical Symmetry Breaking in Quantum
  R^2- gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The dymamical chiral symmetry breaking in higher- derivative quantum gravity
has been investigated on the flat background. The Schwinger- Dyson equations
numerical solutions have been found in the ladder approximation. Both two- and
four- dimensional cases have been considered. The dymamical fermion mass
generation accompanied by the second- order phase transition has been shown to
take place in a different gauges.
