Dynamics of Multiparticle Systems with non - Abelian Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the dynamics governing the evolution of a many body system
constrained by an nonabelian local symmetry. We obtain explicit forms of the
global macroscopic condition assuring that at the microscopic level the
evolution respects the overall symmetry constraint. We demonstrate the
constraint mechanisms for the case of SU(2) system comprising particles in
fundamental, and adjoint representations (`nucleons' and `pions').
