Quantum Integrable Systems: Basic Concepts and Brief Overview
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview of the quantum integrable systems (QIS) is presented. Basic
concepts of the theory are highlighted stressing on the unifying algebraic
properties, which not only helps to generate systematically the representative
Lax operators of different models, but also solves the related eigenvalue
problem in an almost model independent way. Difference between the approaches
in the integrable ultralocal and nonultralocal quantum models are explained and
the interrelation between the QIS and other subjects are focussed on.
