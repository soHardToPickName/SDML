Sigma Model Corrections to the Confining Background
</title>

<abstract>
  Sigma model ($\alpha^{\prime}$) corrections to the confining string
background are obtained. The main result is that the Poincar\'e invariant
ansatz is maintained. Physical conditions for the dissapearance of the naked
singularity are discussed.
