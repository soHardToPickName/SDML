BPS States, Weight Spaces and Vanishing Cycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some simple group theoretical properties of BPS states, in relation
with the singular homology of level surfaces. Primary focus is on classical and
quantum N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, though the considerations can be
applied to string theory as well.
