On Coherent States and q-Deformed Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some aspects of the relation between ordinary coherent states and
q-deformed generalized coherent states with some of the simplest cases of
quantum Lie algebras. In particular, new properties of (q-)coherent states are
utilized to provide a path integral formalism allowing to study a modified form
of q-classical mechanics, to probe some geometrical consequences of the
q-deformation and finally to construct Bargmann complex analytic realizations
for some quantum algebras.
