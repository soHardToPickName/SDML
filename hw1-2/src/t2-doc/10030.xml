O(1/N_f) Corrections to the Thirring Model in 2<d<4
</title>

<abstract>
  The Thirring model, that is, a relativistic field theory of fermions with a
contact interaction between vector currents, is studied for dimensionalities
2<d<4 using the 1/N_f expansion, where N_f is the number of fermion species.
The model is found to have no ultraviolet divergences at leading order provided
a regularization respecting current conservation is used. Explicit O(1/N_f)
corrections are computed, and the model shown to be renormalizable at this
order in the massless limit; renormalizability appears to hold to all orders
due to a special case of Weinberg's theorem. This implies there is a universal
amplitude for four particle scattering in the asymptotic regime. Comparisons
are made with both the Gross-Neveu model and QED.
