T-duality and Effective D-Brane Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  T-duality realized on D-brane effective actions is studied from a pure
worldvolume point of view. It is proved that invariance in the form of the
Dirac-Born-Infeld and Wess-Zumino terms fixes the T-duality transformations of
the NS-NS and R-R background fields, respectively. The analysis is extended to
uncover the mapping of global symmetries of the corresponding pair of D-branes
involved in the transformation.
