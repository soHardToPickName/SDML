Identical Particles and Quantum Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a solution to the problem of compatibility of Bose-Fermi
statistics with symmetry transformations implemented by compact quantum groups
of Drinfel'd type. We use unitary transformations to conjugate multi-particle
symmetry postulates, so as to obtain a twisted realization of the symmetric
groups S_n.
