The string scale and the Planck scale
</title>

<abstract>
  A particle spectrum below the string scale in accordance with predictions
from heterotic string theory yields a Planck mass $m_{Pl}=(8\pi G_N)^{-1/2}$
which exceeds the string scale by a factor $\simeq 61.9$. A Planck mass
$m_{Pl}=2.43\times 10^{18}$ GeV then corresponds to a string scale
$m_s=3.9\times 10^{16}$ GeV. Such a low value for the string scale in turn
implies that the relative strength of graviton and vector exchange in the
string/M-theory phase exceeds the corresponding ratio in the low energy field
theory.
