On the Role of Vector Supersymmetry in Topological Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
Vector supersymmetry is typical of topological field theory. Its role in the
construction of gauge invariant quantities is explained, as well as its role in
the cancellation of the ultraviolet divergences. The example of the
Chern-Simons theory in three dimensions is treated in details.
