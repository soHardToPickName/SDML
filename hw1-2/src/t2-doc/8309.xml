Non-locally Regularized Field-Antifield Quantization of the Chiral
  Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-local regularization is a powerfull method to regularize theories
with an action that can be decomposed in a kinetic and an interacting part.
Recently it was shown how to regularize the Batalin-Vilkovisky field-antifield
formalism of quantization of gauge theories with the non-local regularization.
We compute precisely the anomaly of the Chiral Schwinger model with this
extended non-local regularization.
