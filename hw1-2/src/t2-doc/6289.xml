q-Deformed Dynamics and Virial Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of the q-deformed Heisenberg algebra the investigation of
$q$-deformation of Virial theorem explores that q-deformed quantum mechanics
possesses better dynamical property. It is clarified that in the case of the
zero potential the theoretical framework for the q-deformed Virial theorem is
self-consistent. In the selfadjoint states the q-deformed uncertainty relation
essentially deviates from the Heisenberg one.
