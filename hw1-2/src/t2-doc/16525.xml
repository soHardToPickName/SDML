Circular Semiclassical String Solutions on AdS_5 x S_5
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss two semiclassical string solutions on AdS_5\times S_5. In the
first case, we consider a multiwrapped circular string pulsating in the radial
direction of AdS_5, but fixed to a point on the S_5. We compute the energy of
this motion as a function of a large quantum number $n$. We identify the string
level with $mn$, where $m$ is the number of string wrappings.
  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence, we argue that the bare dimension of the
corresponding gauge invariant operator is $2n$ and that its anomalous dimension
scales as \lambda^{1/4}\sqrt{mn}, for large $n$. Next we consider a
multiwrapped circular string pulsating about two opposite poles of the $S_5$.
We compute the energy of this motion as a function of a large quantum number,
$n$ where again the string level is given as $mn$. We find that the dimension
of the corresponding operator is 2n(1+f(m^2\lambda/(2n)^2)), where f(x) is
computible as a series about x=0 and where it is analytic. We also compare this
result to the BMN result for large J operators.
