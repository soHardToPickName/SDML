Comments on the U(2) Noncommutative Instanton
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the 't Hoof ansatz for instanton solutions in noncommutative U(2)
Yang-Mills theory. We show that the extension of the ansatz leading to singular
solutions in the commutative case, yields to non self-dual (or self-antidual)
configurations in noncommutative space-time. A proposal leading to selfdual
solutions with Q=1 topological charge (the equivalent of the regular BPST
ansatz) can be engineered, but in that case the gauge field and the curvature
are not Hermitian (although the resulting Lagrangian is real).
