w_{\infty} Algebras, Conformal Mechanics, and Black Holes

<abstract>
  We discuss BPS solitons in gauged ${\cal N}=2$, D=4 supergravity. The
solitons represent extremal black holes interpolating between different vacua
of anti-de Sitter spaces. The isometry superalgebras are determined and the
motion of a superparticle in the extremal black hole background is studied and
confronted with superconformal mechanics. We show that the Virasoro symmetry of
conformal mechanics, which describes the dynamics of the superparticle near the
horizon of the extremal black hole under consideration, extends to a symmetry
under the $w_{\infty}$ algebra of area-preserving diffeomorphisms. We find that
a Virasoro subalgebra of $w_{\infty}$ can be associated to the Virasoro algebra
of the asymptotic symmetries of $AdS_2$. In this way spacetime diffeomorphisms
of $AdS_2$ translate into diffeomorphisms in phase space: our system offers an
explicit realization of the $AdS_2/CFT_1$ correspondence. Using the
dimensionally reduced action, the central charge is computed. Finally, we also
present generalizations of superconformal mechanics which are invariant under
${\cal N} =1$ and ${\cal N} =2$ superextensions of $w_{\infty}$.
