IR-Singularities in Noncommutative Perturbative Dynamics?
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the IR-singularities that appear in a noncommutative scalar
quantum field theory on $\mathcal{E}_4$. We demonstrate with the help of the
quadratic one-loop effective action and an appropriate field redefinition that
no IR-singularities exist. No new degrees of freedom are needed to describe the
UV/IR-mixing.
