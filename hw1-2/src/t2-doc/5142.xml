A Two-Form Formulation of the Vector-Tensor Multiplet in Central Charge
  Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  A two-form formulation for the N=2 vector-tensor multiplet is constructed
using superfield methods in central charge superspace. The N=2 non-Abelian
standard supergauge multiplet in central charge superspace is also discussed,
as is with the associated Chern-Simons form. We give the constraints, solve the
Bianchi identities and present the action for a theory of the vector-tensor
multiplet coupled to the non-Abelian supergauge multiplet via the Chern-Simons
form.
