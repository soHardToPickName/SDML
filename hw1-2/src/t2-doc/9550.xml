Superstring with Extrinsic Curvature Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest supersymmetric extension of conformally invariant string theory
which is exclusively based on extrinsic curvature action. At the classical
level this is a tension-less string theory. The absence of conformal anomaly in
quantum theory requires that the space-time should be 6-dimensional.
