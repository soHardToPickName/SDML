Exponential Hierarchy From Spacetime Variable String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that non-supersymmetric spacetime varying string vacua can lead
to an exponential hierarchy between the electroweak and the gravitational
scales. The hierarchy is naturally generated by a string coupling of O(1).
