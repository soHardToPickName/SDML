One-dimensional classical adjoint SU(2) Coulomb Gas
</title>

<abstract>
  The equation of state of a one-dimensional classical nonrelativistic Coulomb
gas of particles in the adjoint representation of SU(2) is given. The problem
is solved both with and without sources in the fundamental representation at
either end of the system. The gas exhibits confining properties at low
densities and temperatures and deconfinement in the limit of high densities and
temperatures. However, there is no phase transition to a regime where the
string tension vanishes identically; true deconfinement only happens for
infinite densities and temperatures. In the low density, low temperature limit,
a new type of collective behavior is observed.
