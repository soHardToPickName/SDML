Towards Nonperturbative Renormalizability of Quantum Einstein Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize recent evidence supporting the conjecture that four-dimensional
Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is nonperturbatively renormalizable along the
lines of Weinberg's asymptotic safety scenario. This would mean that QEG is
mathematically consistent and predictive even at arbitrarily small length
scales below the Planck length. For a truncated version of the exact flow
equation of the effective average action we establish the existence of a
non-Gaussian renormalization group fixed point which is suitable for the
construction of a nonperturbative infinite cutoff-limit. The cosmological
implications of this fixed point are discussed, and it is argued that QEG might
solve the horizon and flatness problem of standard cosmology without an
inflationary period.
