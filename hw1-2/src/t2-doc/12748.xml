Constant threshold correction to electrically charged dilatonic black
  holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the effect of a constant threshold correction to a general
non-extreme, static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black hole
solution of the dilatonic Einstein-Maxwell Lagrangian, with an arbitrary
coupling $\beta$ between the electromagnetic tensor and the dilaton field. For
a small $\beta$, an exact analytical solution is obtained. For an arbitrary
$\beta$, a close form solution, up to first order in the threshold correction,
of the metric and the dilaton are presented. In the extremal limit, the close
form solution is reduced to an exact analytical form.
