Solutions of relativistic wave equations in superpositions of
  Aharonov-Bohm, magnetic, and electric fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new exact solutions (in 3+1 and 2+1 dimensions) of relativistic
wave equations (Klein-Gordon and Dirac) in external electromagnetic fields of
special form. These fields are combinations of Aharonov-Bohm solenoid field and
some additional electric and magnetic fields. In particular, as such additional
fields, we consider longitudinal electric and magnetic fields, some crossed
fields, and some special non-uniform fields. The solutions obtained can be
useful to study Aharonov-Bohm effect in the corresponding electromagnetic
fields.
