New 4D, N = 1 Superfield Theory: Model of Free Massive Superspin-3/2
  Multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a Lagrangian formulation for the free superspin-3/2 massive 4D,
N=1 superfield. The model is described by a dynamical real vector superfield
and an auxiliary real scalar superfield. The corresponding multiplet contains
spin-1, spin-2 and two spin-3/2 propagating component fields on-shell. The
auxillary superfield is needed to ensure that the on-shell vector superfield
carries only the irreducible representation of the Poincare supergroup with a
given mass and the fixed superspin of 3/2. The bosonic sector of the component
level of the model is also presented.
