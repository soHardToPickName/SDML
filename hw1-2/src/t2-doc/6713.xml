Prospects for unification under 4-dimensional optics
</title>

<abstract>
  4-dimensional optics is here introduced axiomatically as the space that
supports a Universal wave equation which is applied to the postulated Higgs
field. Self-guiding of this field is shown to produce all the modes necessary
to provide explanations for the known elementary particles. Forces are shown to
appear as evanescent fields due to waveguiding of the Higgs field, which
provide coupling between waveguides corresponding to different particles.
Carrier particles are also discussed and shown to correspond to waveguided
modes existing in 3-dimensional space.
