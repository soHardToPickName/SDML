Gauge Invariances in Second Class Constrained Systems - A Comparative
  Look at Two Methods
</title>

<abstract>
  We look at and compare two different methods developed earlier for inducing
gauge invariances in systems with second class constraints. These two methods,
the Batalin-Fradkin method and the Gauge Unfixing method, are applied to a
number of systems. We find that the extra field introduced in the
Batalin-Fradkin method can actually be found in the original phase space
itself.
