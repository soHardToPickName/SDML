Three-point functions and operator product expansion in the SL(2)
  conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the SL(2) conformal field theory, we write down and analyze the analytic
expression of the three-point functions of generic primary fields with definite
SL(2) weights. Using these results, we discuss the operator product expansion
in the SL(2,R) WZW model. We propose a prescription of the OPE, the classical
limit of which is in precise agreement with the tensor products of the
representations of SL(2,R).
