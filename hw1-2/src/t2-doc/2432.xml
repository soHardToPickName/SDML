Holography in the Penrose limit of AdS space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Penrose limit of pure AdS space, which is flat Minkowski
space. Even though there is no holographic principle, we construct a
``holographic screen'' on which information on the corresponding CFT is
encoded. The screen is obtained as a gauge-fixing condition upon restricting
the Hilbert space to the states that are annihilated by the generator of scale
transformations. This constraint leads to Dirac brackets which turn the
Poincare algebra into the algebra of the conformal group on the ``holographic
screen.''
