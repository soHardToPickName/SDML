Dirac monopoles embedded into SU(N) gauge theory with $\theta$ - term
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Dirac monopoles embedded into SU(N) gauge theory with theta-term
for $\theta = 4\pi M $ (where $M$ is half-integer for $N = 2$ and is integer
for $N>2$). Due to the theta - term those monopoles obtain the SU(N) charge and
become the dyons. They belong to different irreducible representations of SU(N)
(but not to all of them). The admitted representations are enumerated. Their
minimal rank increases with increasing of $N$. The main result of the paper is
the representation of the partition function of SU(N) model with theta-term
(that contains singular gauge fields correspondent to the mentioned monopoles)
as the vacuum average of the product of Wilson loops (considered along the
monopole worldlines). This vacuum average should be calculated within the
correspondent model without theta-term.
