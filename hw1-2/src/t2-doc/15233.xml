Large-mass behaviour of loop variables in abelian Maxwell-Chern-Simons
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The large-mass behaviour of loop variables in Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory is
analysed by means of a gauge-field transformation which allows to reset the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons action to pure Chern-Simons.
