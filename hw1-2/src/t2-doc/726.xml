ADHM/Nahm Construction of Localized Solitons in Noncommutative Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relationship between ADHM/Nahm construction and ``solution
generating technique'' of BPS solitons in noncommutative gauge theories.
ADHM/Nahm construction and ``solution generating technique'' are the most
strong ways to construct exact BPS solitons. Localized solitons are the
solitons which are generated by the ``solution generating technique.'' The
shift operators which play crucial roles in ``solution generating technique''
naturally appear in ADHM/Nahm construction and we can construct various exact
localized solitons including new solitons: localized periodic instantons
(=localized calorons) and localized doubly-periodic instantons. Nahm
construction also gives rise to BPS fluxons straightforwardly from the
appropriate input Nahm data which is expected from the D-brane picture of BPS
fluxons. We also show that the Fourier-transformed soliton of the localized
caloron in the zero-period limit exactly coincides with the BPS fluxon.
