Quantum Coherence in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The formation and evaporation of two dimensional black holes are discussed.
It is shown that if the radiation in minimal scalars has positive energy, there
must be a global event horizon or a naked singularity. The former would imply
loss of quantum coherence while the latter would lead to an even worse
breakdown of predictability. CPT invariance would suggest that there ought to
be past horizons as well. A way in which this could happen with wormholes is
described.
