A note on D-branes in group manifolds: flux quantisation and D0-charge
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a D-brane in a group manifold given by a (twisted) conjugacy
class is characterised by a gauge invariant two-form field determined in terms
of the matrix of gluing conditions. Using a quantisation argument based on the
path integral one obtains the known quantisation condition for the
corresponding D-branes. We find no evidence for the existence of a quantised
U(1) gauge field flux. We propose an expression for the D0 charge of such
 D-branes.
