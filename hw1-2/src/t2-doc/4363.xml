pp-waves in 11-dimensions with extra supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The Killing spinor equations for pp-wave solutions of eleven dimensional
supergravity are analysed and it is shown that there are solutions that
preserve 18,20,22 and 24 supersymmetries, in addition to the generic solution
preserving 16 supersymmetries and the Kowalski-Glikman solution preserving 32
supersymmetries.
