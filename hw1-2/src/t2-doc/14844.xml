Duality and Confinement in Massive Antisymmetric Tensor Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the duality between massive and topologically massive antisymmetric
tensor gauge theories in arbitrary space-time dimensions to include topological
defects. We show explicitly that the condensation of these defects leads, in 4
dimensions, to confinement of electric strings in the two dual models. The dual
phase, in which magnetic strings are confined is absent. The presence of the
confinement phase explicitly found in the 4-dimensional case, is generalized,
using duality arguments, to arbitrary space-time dimensions.
