A Torsion Correction to the RR 4-Form Fieldstrength
</title>

<abstract>
  The shifted quantization condition of the M-theory 4-form G_4 is well-known.
The most naive generalization to type IIA string theory fails, an orientifold
counterexample was found by Hori in hep-th/9805141. In this note we use
D2-brane anomaly cancellation to find the corresponding shifted quantization
condition in IIA. Our analysis is consistent with the known O4-plane tensions
if we include a torsion correction to the usual construction of G_4 from C_3, B
and G_2. The resulting Bianchi identities enforce that RR fluxes lift to
K-theory classes.
