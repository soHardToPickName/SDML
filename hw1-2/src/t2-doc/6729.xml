Positivity of the Bondi Energy in Einstein-Maxwell Axion- Dilaton
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a proof of the positivity of the Bondi energy in Einstein-Maxwell
axion-dilaton gravity, being the low-energy limit of the heterotic string
theory. We consider the spacelike hypersurface which asymptotically approaches
a null cone and on which the equations of the theory under consideration are
given. Next, we generalize the proof allowing the hypersurface having inner
boundaries.
