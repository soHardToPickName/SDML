Geometric Origin of Montonen-Olive Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how $N=4, D=4$ duality of Montonen and Olive can be derived for all
gauge groups using geometric engineering in the context of type II strings,
where it reduces to T-duality. The derivation for the non-simply laced cases
involves the use of some well known facts about orbifold conformal theories.
