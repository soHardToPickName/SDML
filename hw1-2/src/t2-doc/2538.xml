The Moduli Space of BPS Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a progress in our understanding of the moduli space for an
arbitrary number of BPS monopoles in a gauge theory with a group $G$ of rank
$r$ that is maximally broken to $U(1)^r$. The derivation of the moduli space
metric has been obtained from studying the low energy dynamics of
well-separated dyons.
