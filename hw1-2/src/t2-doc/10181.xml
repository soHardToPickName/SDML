On the String Description of Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  A non supersymmetric string background, directly derived from the string soft
dilaton theorem, is used to compute, in the semiclassical approximation, the
expectation value of Wilson loops in static gauge. The resulting potential
shares common features with the one obtained through Schwarzschild-anti de
Sitter spacetime metrics. In particular a linear confining potential appears
naturally.
