Zero-curvature condition in two dimensions. Relativistic particle models
  and finite \W-transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  A relation between an $Sp(2M)$ gauge particle model and the zero-curvature
condition in a two-dimensional gauge theory is presented. For the $Sp(4)$ case
we construct finite \W-transformations.
