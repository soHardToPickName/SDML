Intersecting D-branes and black holes in type 0 string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study intersecting D-branes in type 0 string theories and show that the
D$p_{\pm}$-brane bound states obey similar intersecting rules as the
D$p$-branes of the type II theories. The D$5_{\pm}$-D$1_{\pm}$ brane system is
studied in detail. We show that the corresponding near-horizon geometry is the
$AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ space and that there is no tachyon instability in
this background. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is calculated. The worldvolume
theory on the D$5_{\pm}$-D$1_{\pm}$ system is also studied. This theory
contains both bosons and fermions and it is seen to arise as a projection of
the supersymmetric gauge theory related to the D5-D1 system of the type IIB
theory. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula is reproduced exactly using the
dual conformal field theory.
