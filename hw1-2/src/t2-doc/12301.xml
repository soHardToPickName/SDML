Stable de Sitter Vacua from N=2 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We find extrema of the potential of matter couplings to N=2 supergravity that
define de Sitter vacua and no tachyonic modes. There are three essential
ingredients in our construction: namely non-abelian non-compact gaugings, de
Roo-Wagemans rotation angles, and Fayet-Iliopoulos terms.
