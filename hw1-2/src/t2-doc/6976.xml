On the Poisson Structure of the Time-Dependent Mean-Field Equations for
  Systems of Bosons out of Equilibrium
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the Poisson structure of the time-dependent mean-field equations
for bosons and construct the Lie-Poisson bracket associated to these equations.
The latter follow from the time-dependent variational principle of Balian and
Veneroni when a gaussian Ansatz is chosen for the density operator. We perform
a stability analysis of both the full and the linearized equations. We also
search for the canonically conjugate variables. In certain cases, the evolution
equations can indeed be cast in a Hamiltonian form.
