On non-uniform black branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Certain black branes are unstable toward fluctuations that lead to
non-uniform mass distributions. We study static, non-uniform solutions that
differ only perturbatively from uniform ones. For uncharged black strings in
five dimensions, we find evidence of a first order transition from uniform to
non-uniform solutions.
