Exact solutions of an elliptic Calogero--Sutherland model
</title>

<abstract>
  A model describing N particles on a line interacting pairwise via an elliptic
function potential in the presence of an external field is partially solved in
the quantum case in a totally algebraic way. As an example, the ground state
and the lowest excitations are calculated explicitly for N=2.
