Hawking radiation of nonsingular black holes in two dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we study the process of Hawking radiation of a black hole
assuming the existence of a limiting physical curvature scale. The particular
model is constructed using the Limiting Curvature Hypothesis (LCH) and in the
context of two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The black hole solution exhibits
properties of the standard Schwarzschild solution at large values of the radial
coordinate. However, near the center, the black hole is nonsingular and the
metric becomes that of de Sitter spacetime. The Hawking temperature is
calculated using the method of complex paths. We find that such black holes
radiate eternally and never completely evaporate. The final state is an
eternally radiating relic, near the fundamental scale, which should make a
viable dark matter candidate. We briefly comment on the black hole information
loss problem and the production of such black holes in collider experiments.
