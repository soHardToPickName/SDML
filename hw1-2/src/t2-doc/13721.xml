Non-supersymmetric Orientifolds with D-branes at Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  We present special classes of orientifold models involving supersymmetry
breaking via branes at angles. Type II superstring theories are compactified on
a two torus times a four-dimensional orbifold. Combining worldsheet parity with
a reflection of half of the compact coordinates leads to D6-branes at angles
which are mapped onto each other by the orbifold group, while applying the
geometric action only along one coordinate leads to intersecting D8-branes with
non-trivial transformation properties under the orbifold group. The models
differ in the gauge groups and matter content.
