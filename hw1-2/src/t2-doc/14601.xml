BRST analysis of N=2 superconformal minimal unitary models in Coulomb
  gas formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a BRST analysis of the N=2 superconformal minimal unitary models.
A bosonic as well as fermionic BRST operators are used to construct irreducible
representations of the N=2 superconformal algebra on the Fock space as BRST
cohomology classes of the BRST operators. Also a character formula is rederived
by using the BRST analysis.
