Particle production in string cosmology models
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute spectra of particles produced during a dilaton-driven kinetic
inflation phase within string cosmology models. The resulting spectra depend on
the parameters of the model and on the type of particle and are quite varied,
some increasing and some decreasing with frequency. We use an approximation
scheme in which all spectra can be expressed in a nice symmetric form, perhaps
hinting at a deeper symmetry of the underlying physics. Our results may serve
as a starting point for detailed studies of relic abundances, dark matter
candidates, and possible sources of large scale anisotropy.
