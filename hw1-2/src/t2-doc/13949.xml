Locally Anisotropic Interactions: II. Torsions and Curvatures of Higher
  Order Anisotropic Superspaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Torsions, curvatures, structure equations and Bianchi identities for locally
anisotropic superspaces (containing as particular cases different
supersymmetric extensions and prolongations of Riemann, Finsler, Lagrange and
Kaluza--Klein spaces) are investigated.
