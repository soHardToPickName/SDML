Exercising in K-theory: Brane Condensation without Tachyon
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the p-dimensional noncommutative Yang--Mills model corresponding
to a (p-1)-brane allows solutions which correspond to lower branes. This may be
interpreted as the Morita equivalence of noncommutative planes of various
dimensions.
