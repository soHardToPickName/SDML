Factorization and q-Deformed Algebra of Quantum Anharmonic Oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  We have studied the underlying algebraic structure of the anharmonic
oscillator by using the variational perturbation theory. To the first order of
the variational perturbation, the Hamiltonian is found to be factorized into a
supersymmetric form in terms of the annihilation and creation operators, which
satisfy a q-deformed algebra. This algebraic structure is used to construct all
the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.
