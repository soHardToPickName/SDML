String-derived renormalization of Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the application of bosonic string techniques to the calculation of
renormalization constants and effective actions in Yang-Mills theory. We
display the multiloop string formulas needed to compute Yang-Mills amplitudes,
and we discuss how the renormalizations of proper vertices can be extracted in
the field theory limit. We show how string techniques lead to the background
field method in field theory, and indicate how the gauge invariance of the
multiloop effective action can be inferred form the string formalism.
