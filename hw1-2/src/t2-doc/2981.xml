Higher Order Conformal Invariance of String Backgrounds Obtained by
  O(d,d) Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  Proposals that $O(d,d)$ boosts of trivial backgrounds lead to non-trivial
conformally invariant backgrounds are checked to two loop order. We find that
conformal invariance can be achieved by adding simple higher order corrections
to the metric and dilaton.
