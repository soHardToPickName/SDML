Monopole equations on 8-manifolds with Spin(7) holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a consistent set of monopole equations on eight-manifolds with
Spin(7) holonomy. These equations are elliptic and admit non-trivial solutions
including all the 4-dimensional Seiberg-Witten solutions as a special case.
