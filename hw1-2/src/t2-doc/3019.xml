Localization and Nonperturbative Local Quantum Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  The main content of this treatise is a new concept in nonperturbative
non-Lagrangian QFT which explains and extends the ad hoc constructions in
low-dimensional models and incorporates them together with the higher
dimensional theories into a new construction method. Thermal and entropical
properties, which were hitherto restricted to situations with classical
horizons (Killing vectors), are now generic (nonperturbative) aspects of
"modular localization". The underlying more algebraic (and less geometric) mode
of thinking also gives rise to interesting questions in renormalizable
deformatioms of higher spin fields, in particular gauge theories.
