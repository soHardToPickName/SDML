On the Effective Description of Dynamically Broken SUSY-Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new class of models describing dynamically broken
supersymmetric theories at low energies. Our approach is a direct
generalization of the known supersymmetric non-linear sigma models, but allows
in contrast to the latter the description of dynamical supersymmetry breaking
by non-perturbative non-semiclassical effects. It is especially useful within
the context of quantum effective actions and the associated concept of symmetry
breaking as a hysteresis effect.
