Lagrangian approach to local symmetries and self-dual model in gauge
  invariant formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking the St\"uckelberg Lagrangian associated with the abelian self-dual
model of P.K. Townsend et al as a starting point, we embed this mixed first-
and second-class system into a pure first-class system by following
systematically the generalized Hamiltonian approach of Batalin, Fradkin and
Tyutin. The resulting Lagrangian possesses an extended gauge invariance and
provides a non-trivial example for a general Lagrangian approach to unravelling
the full set of local symmetries of a Lagrangian.
