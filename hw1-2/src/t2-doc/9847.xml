Strings in Noncompact Spacetimes: Boundary Terms and Conserved Charges
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some of the novel properties of conformal field theories with
noncompact target spaces as applied to string theory. Standard CFT results get
corrected by boundary terms in the target space in a way consistent with the
expected spacetime physics. For instance, one-point functions of general
operators on the sphere and boundary operators on the disk need not vanish; we
show that they are instead equal to boundary terms in spacetime. By applying
this result to vertex operators for spacetime gauge transformations with
support at infinity, we derive formulas for conserved gauge charges in string
theory. This approach provides a direct CFT definition of ADM energy-momentum
in string theory.
