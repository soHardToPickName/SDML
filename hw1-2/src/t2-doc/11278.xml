Fermionic Sum Representations for the Virasoro Characters of the Unitary
  Superconformal Minimal Models
</title>

<abstract>
We present fermionic sum representation for the general Virasoro character of
the unitary minimal superconformal series ($N=1$). Example of the corresponding
``finitizated" identities relating corner transfer matrix polynomials with
fermionic companions is considered. These identities in the thermodynamic limit
lead to the generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
