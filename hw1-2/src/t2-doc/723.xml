Anomalies in Instanton Calculus

<abstract>
  I develop a formalism for solving topological field theories explicitly, in
the case when the explicit expression of the instantons is known. I solve
topological Yang-Mills theory with the $k=1$ Belavin {\sl et al.} instanton and
topological gravity with the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. It turns out that naively
empty theories are indeed nontrivial. Many unexpected interesting hidden
quantities (punctures, contact terms, nonperturbative anomalies with or without
gravity) are revealed. Topological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ is not just
Donaldson theory, but contains a certain {\sl link} theory. Indeed, local and
non-local observables have the property of {\sl marking} cycles. From
topological gravity one learns that an object can be considered BRST exact only
if it is so all over the moduli space ${\cal M}$, boundary included. Being BRST
exact in any interior point of ${\cal M}$ is not sufficient to make an
amplitude vanish. Presumably, recursion relations and hierarchies can be found
to solve topological field theories in four dimensions, in particular
topological Yang-Mills theory with $G=SU(2)$ on ${\bf R}^4$ and topological
gravity on ALE manifolds.
