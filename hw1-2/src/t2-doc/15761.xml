$SU(2,R)_q $ Symmetries of Non-Abelian Toda Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical and quantum algebras of a class of conformal NA-Toda models are
studied. It is shown that the $SL(2,R)_q$ Poisson brackets algebra generated by
certain chiral and antichiral charges of the nonlocal currents and the global
U(1) charge appears as an algebra of the symmetries of these models.
