The WZW model on Random Regge Triangulations
</title>

<abstract>
  By exploiting the correspondence between Random Regge triangulations (i.e.,
Regge triangulations with variable connectivity) and punctured Riemann
surfaces, we are able to characterize the SU(2) Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a
triangulated surface of genus g.
