Recent Developments in the Theory of Tunneling
</title>

<abstract>
  Path-integral approach in imaginary and complex time has been proven
successful in treating the tunneling phenomena in quantum mechanics and quantum
field theories. Latest developments in this field, the proper valley method in
imaginary time, its application to various quantum systems, complex time
formalism, asympton theory for the large order analysis of the perturbation
theory, are reviewed in a self-contained manner.
