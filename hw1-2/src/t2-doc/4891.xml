Integrable XYZ Spin Chain with Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a general class of boundary terms of the open XYZ spin-1/2 chain
compatible with integrability. We have obtained the general elliptic solution
of $K$-matrix obeying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation using the $R$-matrix of
the eight vertex model and derived the associated integrable spin-chain
Hamiltonian.
