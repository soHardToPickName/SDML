Virtual Reality in the World of Holograms

<abstract>
  If we assume that the initial conditions for the universe were such that
there was no volume-extensive entropy `at the beginning of time' (which is true
in Linde's chaotic inflation), we can formulate a covariant holographic bound
on the entanglement entropy inside or outside closed space-like surfaces. This
bound should hold even for regions where the coarse-grained entropy exceeds the
surface area. We find that Bousso's bound gives strong support for this
conjecture. We also present a speculative interpretation of the entropy bound,
according to which any observer of interest can be surrounded by a holographic
screen, providing a non-redundant description of the rest of the universe.
