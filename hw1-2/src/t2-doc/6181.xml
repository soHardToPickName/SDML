Realizations of the $q$-Heisenberg and $q$-Virasoro Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We give field theoretic realizations of both the $q$-Heisenberg and the
$q$-Virasoro algebra. In particular, we obtain the operator product expansions
among the current and the energy momentum tensor obtained using the Sugawara
construction.
