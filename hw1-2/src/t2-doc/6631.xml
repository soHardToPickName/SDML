String Breaking from Ladder Diagrams in SYM Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence establishes a string representation for Wilson
loops in N=4 SYM theory at large N and large 't Hooft coupling. One of the
clearest manifestations of the stringy behaviour in Wilson loop correlators is
the string-breaking phase transition. It is shown that resummation of planar
diagrams without internal vertices predicts the strong-coupling phase transtion
in exactly the same setting in which it arises from the string representation.
