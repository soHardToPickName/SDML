Topology of 3-dimensional Seiberg-Witten theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A dual description of 3-dimensional topological Seiberg-Witten theory in
terms of the Alexander invariant on manifolds obtained via surgery on a knot is
proposed. The description directly follows from a low-energy analysis of the
corresponding SUSY theory, in full analogy to the 4-dimensional case.
