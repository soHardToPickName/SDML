An alternative approach to KP hierarchy in matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there exists an alternative procedure in order to extract
differential hierarchies, such as the KdV hierarchy, from one--matrix models,
without taking a continuum limit. To prove this we introduce the Toda lattice
and reformulate it in operator form. We then consider the reduction to the
systems appropriate for one--matrix model.
