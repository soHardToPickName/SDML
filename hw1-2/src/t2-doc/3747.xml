Supersymmetric Wilson loops
</title>

<abstract>
  I construct 1/16, 1/8 and 1/4 BPS Wilson loops in N=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory and argue that expectation values of 1/4 BPS loops do not
receive quantum corrections. At strong coupling, non-renormalization of
supersymmetric Wilson loops implies subtle cancellations in the partition
function of the AdS string with special boundary conditions. The cancellations
are shown to occur in the semiclassical approximation.
