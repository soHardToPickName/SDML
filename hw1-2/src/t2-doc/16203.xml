Field Theory Operator Encoding in N=2 Geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate supergravity solutions describing D5 branes wrapped on a two
cycle which are dual to N=2 super Yang Mills theory. Brane probing these
solutions allows the moduli space of the field theory to be identified. There
are a unique set of coordinates in which the field theory on the probe takes an
N=2 form and in these coordinates the running coupling of the gauge theory may
be identified. We show that the geometry, when restricted to the moduli space,
takes a very simple form involving only two functions. One is the running gauge
coupling whilst the other parametrizes the scalar operators of the field
theory. The D5 brane distributions, for the full set of solutions in the
literature,can be determined by assuming the field theory's form for the
running coupling as a function of scalar vevs. We show that the resulting
distributions also correctly reproduce the scalar operators parametrized
elsewhere providing the first non-trivial consistency check on the duality.
