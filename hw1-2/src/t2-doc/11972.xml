Operator Regularization and Large Noncommutative Chern Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine noncommutative Chern Simons theory using operator regularization.
Both the zeta-function and the eta-function are needed to determine one loop
effects. The contributions to these functions coming from the two point
function is evaluated. The U(N) noncommutative model smoothly reduces to the
SU(N) commutative model as the noncommutative parameter theta_{mu nu} vanishes.
