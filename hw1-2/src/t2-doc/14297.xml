Zero-Mode Problem on the Light Front
</title>

<abstract>
  A series of lectures are given to discuss the zero-mode problem on the
light-front (LF) quantization with special emphasis on the peculiar realization
of the trivial vacuum, the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and the Lorentz
invariance. We discuss Discrete Light-Cone Quantization (DLCQ) which was first
introduced by Maskawa and Yamawaki (MY). Following MY, we present canonical
formalism of DLCQ and the zero-mode constraint through which the zero mode can
actually be solved away in terms of other modes,thus establishing the trivial
vacuum. Due to this trivial vacuum, existence of the massless Nambu-Goldstone
(NG) boson coupled to the current is guaranteed by the non-conserved charge
such that Q |0> = 0 and dot{Q} ne 0. The SSB (NG phase) in DLCQ can be realized
on the trivial vacuum only when an explicit symmetry-breaking mass of the NG
boson m_{pi} is introduced so that the NG-boson zero mode integrated over the
LF exhibits singular behavior sim 1/m_{pi}^2 in such a way that dot{Q} ne 0 in
the symmetric limit m_{pi} -> 0. We also demonstrate this realization more
explicitly in the linear sigma model where the role of zero-mode constraint is
clarified. We fur ther point out, in disagreement with Wilson et al., that for
SSB in the continuum LF theory, the trivial vacuum collapses due to the special
nature of the zero mode as the accumulating point P^+ -> 0, in sharp contrast
to DLCQ. Finally, we discuss the no-go theorem of Nakanishi and Yamawaki, which
forbids exact LF r estriction of the field theory. Thus DLCQ as well as any
other regularization on the exact LF has no Lorentz-invariant limit as the
theory itself, although the Lorentz-invariant limit can be realized on the
c-number quantity like S matrix which has no reference to the fixed LF.
