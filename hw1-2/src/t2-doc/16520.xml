D-branes and Matrix Theory in Curved Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation between supersymmetric gauge theory of branes and
supergravity; as it was discovered in D-brane physics, and as it appears in
Matrix theory, with emphasis on motion in curved backgrounds. We argue that
gauged sigma model Lagrangians can be used as definitions of Matrix theory in
curved space. Lecture given at Strings '97; June 20, 1997.
