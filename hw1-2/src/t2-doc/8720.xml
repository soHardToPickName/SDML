Three-block p-branes in various dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a Lagrangian, describing the interaction of the gravitation
field with the dilaton and the antisymmetric tensor in arbitrary dimension
spacetime, admits an isotropic p-brane solution consisting of three blocks.
Relations with known p-brane solutions are discussed. In particular, in
ten-dimensional spacetime the three-block p-brane solution is reduced to the
known solution, which recently has been used in the D-brane derivation of the
black hole entropy.
