Subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum of the Maxwell equations
  and the massless Dirac equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Maxwell equations and Dirac equation (with zero mass term) have
both subluminal and superluminal solutions in vacuum. We also discuss the
possible fundamental physical consequences of our results.
