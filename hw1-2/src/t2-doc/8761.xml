Casimir force between Chern-Simons surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the Casimir force between two parallel plates if the boundary
conditions for the photons are modified due to presence of the Chern-Simons
term. We show that this effect should be measurable within the present
experimental technique.
