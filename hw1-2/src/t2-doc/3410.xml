Open Strings on Plane waves and their Yang-Mills duals
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the plane wave limit of $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_2$ which arises as the
near horizon geometry of D3-branes at an orientifold 7-plane in type I' theory.
We analyze string theory in the resulting plane wave background which contains
open strings. We identify gauge invariant operators in the dual $Sp(N)$ gauge
theory with unoriented closed and open string states.
