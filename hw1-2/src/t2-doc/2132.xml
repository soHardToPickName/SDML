A class of non-singular gravi-dilaton backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of static, spherically symmetric, non-singular solutions
of the tree-level string effective action, truncated to first order in
$\alpha'$. In the string frame the solutions approach asymptotically (at $r\to
0$ and $r\to \infty$) two different anti-de Sitter configurations, thus
interpolating between two maximally symmetric states of different constant
curvature. The radial-dependent dilaton defines a string coupling which is
everywhere finite, with a peak value that can be chosen arbitrarily small so as
to neglect quantum-loop corrections. This example stresses the possible
importance of finite-size $\alpha'$ corrections, typical of string theory, in
avoiding space-time singularities.
