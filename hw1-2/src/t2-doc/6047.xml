Induced QCD from the Noncommutative Geometry of a Supermanifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the noncommutative geometry of a two-leaf Parisi--Sourlas
supermanifold in Connes' formalism using different $K$-cycles over the
Grassmann algebra valued functions on the supermanifold. We find that the
curvature of the trivial noncommutative vector bundle defines in the simplest
case the super Yang--Mills action coupled to a scalar field. By considering a
modified Dirac operator and a suitable limit of its parameters we then obtain
an action that turns out to be the continuum limit of the induced QCD in
Kazakov--Migdal model.
