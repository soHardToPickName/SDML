Notes on Connes' Construction of the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The mathematical apparatus of non commutative geometry and operator algebras
which Connes has brought to bear to construct a rational scheme for the
internal symmetries of the standard model is presented from the physicist's
point of view. Gauge symmetry, anomaly freedom, conservation of electric
charge, parity violation and charge conjugation all play a vital role. When put
together with a relatively simple set of algebraic algorithms they deliver many
of the features of the standard model which otherwise seem rather ad hoc.
