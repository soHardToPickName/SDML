On the power counting of loop diagrams in general relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of loop diagrams in general relativity appears to have a behavior
which would upset the utility of the energy expansion for quantum effects. We
show through the study of specific diagrams that cancellations occur which
restore the expected behaviour of the energy expansion. By considering the
power counting in a physical gauge we show that the apparent bad behavior is a
gauge artifact, and that the quantum loops enter with a well behaved energy
expansion.
