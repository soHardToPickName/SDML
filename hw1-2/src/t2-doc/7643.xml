BPS Saturated Amplitudes and Non-perturbative String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The study of the special F^4 and R^4 in the effective action for the
Spin(32)/Z_2 and type II strings sheds some light on D-brane calculus and on
instanton contribution counting. The D-instanton case is discussed separately.
