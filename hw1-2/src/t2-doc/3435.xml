Preferred Frame in Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of brane models the postulates of special relativity theory
is revised. It is assumed that there exists preferred frame and relativity
principle is violated on the brane. Because of trapping any moving object on
the brane is really accelerated and the formulas for gravitational contraction
of the intervals (containing the escape speed) appears to be equivalent to
ordinary Lorentz ones.
