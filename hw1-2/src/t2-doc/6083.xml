Functional Relations in Stokes Multipliers and Solvable Models related
  to U_q(A^{(1)}_n)
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, Dorey and Tateo have investigated functional relations among Stokes
multipliers for a Schr{\"o}dinger equation (second order differential equation)
with a polynomial potential term in view of solvable models. Here we extend
their studies to a restricted case of n+1-th order linear differential
equations.
