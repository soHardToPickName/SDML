D-branes in group manifolds and flux stabilization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider D-branes in group manifolds, from the point of view of open
strings and using the Born-Infeld action on the brane worldvolume. D-branes
correspond to certain integral (twined) conjugacy classes. We explain the
integrality condition on the conjugacy classes in both approaches. In the
Born-Infeld description, the D-brane worldvolume is stabilized against
shrinking by a subtle interplay of quantized U(1) fluxes and the non-triviality
of the B-field.
