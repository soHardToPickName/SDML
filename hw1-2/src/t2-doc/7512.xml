Boundary S-matrix of the $O(N)$-symmetric Non-linear Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture that the $O(N)$-symmetric non-linear sigma model in the
semi-infinite $(1+1)$-dimensional space is ``integrable'' with respect to the
``free'' and the ``fixed'' boundary conditions. We then derive, for both cases,
the boundary S-matrix for the reflection of massive particles of this model off
the boundary at $x=0$.
