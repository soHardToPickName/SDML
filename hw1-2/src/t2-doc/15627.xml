Neutrino Zero Modes and Stability of Electroweak Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss massless and massive neutrino zero modes in the background of an
electroweak string. We argue that the eventual absence of the neutrino zero
mode implies the existence of topologically stable strings where the required
non-trivial topology has been induced by the fermionic sector.
