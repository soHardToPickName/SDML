HyperK\"ahler quotients and N=4 gauge theories in D=2
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider certain N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories in D=2 coupled to
quaternionic matter multiplets in a minimal way. These theories admit as
effective theories sigma-models on non-trivial HyperK\"ahler manifolds obtained
as HyperK\"ahler quotients. The example of ALE manifolds is discussed. (Based
on a talk given by P. Fr\'e at the F. Gursey Memorial Conference, Istanbul,
June 1994).
