Boundary String Field Theory of the DDbar System
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop the boundary string field theory approach to tachyon condensation
on the DDbar system. Particular attention is paid to the gauge fields, which
combine with the tachyons in a natural way. We derive the RR-couplings of the
system and express the result in terms of Quillen's superconnection. The result
is related to an index theorem, and is thus shown to be exact.
