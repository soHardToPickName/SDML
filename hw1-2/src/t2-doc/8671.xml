Rotating NS5-brane solution and its exact string theoretical description
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the most general solution in type-II string theory that
represents N coincident non-extremal rotating NS5-branes and determine the
relevant thermodynamic quantities. We show that in the field theory limit, it
has an exact description. In particular, it can be obtained by an O(3,3)
duality transformation on the exact string background for the coset model
SL(2,R)_{-N}/U(1) \times SU(2)_N. In the extreme supersymmetric limit we
recover the multicenter solution, with a ring singularity structure, that has
been discussed recently.
