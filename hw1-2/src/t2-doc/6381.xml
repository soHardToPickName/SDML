K\"ahler Moduli Space of a D-Brane at Orbifold Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method to analyze systematically the configuration space of a
D-brane localized at the orbifold singular point of a Calabi--Yau $d$-fold of
the form ${\Bbb C}^d/\Gamma$ using the theory of toric quotients. This approach
elucidates the structure of the K\"ahler moduli space associated with the
problem. As an application, we compute the toric data of the $\Gamma$-Hilbert
scheme.
