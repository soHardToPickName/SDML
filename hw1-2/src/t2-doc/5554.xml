Capture of bulk geodesics by brane-world black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we study bulk timelike geodesics in the presence of a
brane-world black hole, where the brane-world is a two-brane moving in a
3+1-dimensional asymptotically $adS_4$ spacetime. We show that for a certain
range of the parameters measuring the black hole mass and bulk cosmological
constant, there exist stable timelike geodesics which orbit the black hole and
remain bound close to the two-brane.
