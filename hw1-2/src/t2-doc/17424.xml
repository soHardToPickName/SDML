Wigner distribution function and entropy of the damped harmonic
  oscillator within the theory of open quantum systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The harmonic oscillator with dissipation is studied within the framework of
the Lindblad theory for open quantum systems. By using the Wang-Uhlenbeck
method, the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained from the master equation for the
density operator, is solved for the Wigner distribution function, subject to
either the Gaussian type or the $\delta$-function type of initial conditions.
The obtained Wigner functions are two-dimensional Gaussians with different
widths. Then a closed expression for the density operator is extracted. The
entropy of the system is subsequently calculated and its temporal behaviour
shows that this quantity relaxes to its equilibrium value.
