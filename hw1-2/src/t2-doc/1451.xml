Hodge-type self(antiself)-duality for general p-form fields in arbitrary
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is often claimed [PST1] that the (Hodge type) duality operation is defined
only in even dimensional spacetimes and that self-duality is further restricted
to twice-odd dimensional spacetime theories.
  The purpose of this paper is to extend the notion of both duality symmetry as
well as self-duality.
  By considering tensorial doublets, we introduce a novel well-defined notion
of self-duality based on a duality Hodge-type operation in arbitrary dimension
and for any rank of these tensors. Thus, a generalized Self-Dual Action is
defined such that equations of motion are the claimed generalized self-duality
relations. We observe in addition, that taking the proper limit on the
parameters of this action, it always provides us with a master-action, which
interpolates models well-studied in physics; by considering a particular limit,
we find an action which describes an interesting type of relation, referred to
as semi-self-duality, which results to be the parent action between Maxwell-
type actions.
  Finally, we apply these ideas to construct manifest Hodge-type self-dual
solutions in a (2+1)-dimensional version of the Maxwell's theory.
