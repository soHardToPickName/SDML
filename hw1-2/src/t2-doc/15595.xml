Brane Death via Born-Infeld String
</title>

<abstract>
  I revisit the solution of Born-Infeld theory which corresponds to a 3-brane
and anti-brane joined by a (fundamental) string. The global instability of this
configuration makes possible the semiclassical tunneling into a wide, short
tube which keeps expanding out, thus annihilating the brane . This tunneling is
suppressed exponentially as $\exp(- S_{cl}/g)$. The attraction between the
branes causes them to approach and at some point to tunnel, because the action
of the bounce solution goes to zero. The energy of the solution at the top of
the barrier, the sphaleron, goes like $\sim D^3$ for large separarions D, while
the energy of the string is proportional to its length D.
