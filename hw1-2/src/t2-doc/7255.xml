Couplings for Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  A general formula is obtained for Yukawa couplings in compactification on
\LGO{s} and corresponding \CY\ spaces. Up to the kinetic term normalizations,
this equates the classical Koszul ring structure with the \LGO\ chiral ring
structure and the true super\CFT\ ring structure.
