On Zero Modes and the Vacuum Problem -- A Study of Scalar Adjoint Matter
  in Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory via Light-Cone Quantisation

<abstract>
  SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory coupled to massive adjoint scalar matter is studied
in (1+1) dimensions using Discretised Light-Cone Quantisation. This theory can
be obtained from pure Yang-Mills in 2+1 dimensions via dimensional reduction.
On the light-cone, the vacuum structure of this theory is encoded in the
dynamical zero mode of a gluon and a constrained mode of the scalar field. The
latter satisfies a linear constraint, suggesting no nontrivial vacua in the
present paradigm for symmetry breaking on the light-cone. I develop a
diagrammatic method to solve the constraint equation. In the adiabatic
approximation I compute the quantum mechanical potential governing the
dynamical gauge mode. Due to a condensation of the lowest omentum modes of the
dynamical gluons, a centrifugal barrier is generated in the adiabatic
potential. In the present theory however, the barrier height appears too small
to make any impact in this odel. Although the theory is superrenormalisable on
naive powercounting grounds, the removal of ultraviolet divergences is
nontrivial when the constrained mode is taken into account. The open aspects of
this problem are discussed in detail.
