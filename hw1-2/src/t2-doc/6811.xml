Magnetic Monopoles, Duality, and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  These notes present a pedagogical introduction to magnetic monopoles and
exact electromagnetic duality in supersymmetric gauge theories. They are based
on lectures given at the 1995 Trieste Summer School in High Energy Physics and
Cosmology and at the 1995 Busstepp Summer School at Cosener's House.
