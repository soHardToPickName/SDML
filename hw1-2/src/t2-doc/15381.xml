BRST formalism for systems with higher order derivatives of gauge
  parameters
</title>

<abstract>
  For a wide class of mechanical systems, invariant under gauge transformations
with higher (arbitrary) order time derivatives of gauge parameters, the
equivalence of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian BRST formalisms is proved. It is
shown that the Ostrogradsky formalism establishes the natural rules to relate
the BFV ghost canonical pairs with the ghosts and antighosts introduced by the
Lagrangian approach. Explicit relation between corresponding gauge-fixing terms
is obtained.
