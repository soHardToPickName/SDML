Non-BPS D-brane Solutions in Six Dimensional Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with the non-BPS D0-brane solution of IIB/$(-1)^{F_L}I_4$
constructed recently by Eyras and Panda we construct via T-duality the non-BPS
D2-brane and D1-brane solutions of IIB/$(-1)^{F_L}I_4$ and IIA/$(-1)^{F_L}I_4$
predicted by Sen. The D2-brane couples magnetically to the vector field of the
NS5B-brane living in the twisted sector of the Type IIB orbifold, whereas the
D1-brane couples (electrically and magnetically) to the self-dual 2-form
potential of the NS5A-brane that is present in the twisted sector of the Type
IIA orbifold construction. Finally we discuss the eleven dimensional
interpretation of these branes as originating from a non-BPS M1-brane solution
of M-theory orientifolded by $\Omega_\rho I_5$.
