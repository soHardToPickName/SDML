Liouville central charge in quantum Teichmuller theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the quantum Teichmuller theory, based on Penner coordinates, the mapping
class groups of punctured surfaces are represented projectively. The case of a
genus three surface with one puncture is worked out explicitly. The projective
factor is calculated. It is given by the exponential of the Liouville central
charge.
