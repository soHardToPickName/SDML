Partially Localized Intersecting BPS Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the explicit forms of supergravity solutions for the various
intersecting two BPS branes in eleven and ten dimensions, where one brane is
localized at the delocalized other brane. Our partially localized supergravity
solutions describe brane configurations in the near horizon region of the
delocalized branes, where the two constituent branes meet in the overall
transverse space and the delocalized branes coincide. We also give the brane
worldvolume interpretations for some of such supergravity solutions.
