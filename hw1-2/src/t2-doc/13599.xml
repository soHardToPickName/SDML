Correlation Functions in 2-Dimensional Integrable Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I discuss the form factor approach used to compute correlation
functions of integrable models in two dimensions. The Sinh-Gordon model is our
basic example. Using Watson's and the recursive equations satisfied by matrix
elements of local operators, I present the computation of the form factors of
the elementary field $\phi(x)$ and the stress-energy tensor $T_{\mu\nu}(x)$ of
the theory.
