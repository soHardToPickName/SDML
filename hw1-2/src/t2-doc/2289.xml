Compactifying M-Theory to Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider compactifications of ${\cal M}$-theory to four-dimensional
Minkowski space on seven-dimensional non-compact manifolds. These
compactifications include a warp factor which is non-constant due to the
presence of sources coming from fivebranes wrapping two-dimensional
submanifolds of the internal seven-dimensional space. We derive the expression
for the field strengths and consider an explicit example of this general class
of solutions.
