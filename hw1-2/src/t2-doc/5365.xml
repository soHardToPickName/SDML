Topological Aspects of Quantum Chromodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Absolute confinement of its color charges is a natural property of gauge
theories such as quantum chromodynamics. On the one hand, it can be attributed
to the existence of color-magnetic monopoles, a topological feature of the
theory, but one can also maintain that all non-Abelian gauge theories confine.
It is illustrated how ``confinement'' works in the SU(2) sector of the Standard
Model, and why for example the electron and its neutrino can be viewed as
SU(2)-hadronic bound states rather than a gauge doublet.
  The mechanism called `Abelian projection' then puts the Abelian sector of any
gauge theory on a separate footing.
