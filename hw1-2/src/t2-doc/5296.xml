A symplectic structure for the space of quantum field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the formal Lie algebraic structure in the ``space'' of hamiltonians
provided by equal time commutators to define a Kirillov-Konstant symplectic
structure in the coadjoint orbits of the associated formal group. The dual is
defined via the natural pairing between operators and states in a Hilbert
space.
