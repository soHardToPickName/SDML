Stimulated emission of particles by 1+1 dimensional black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The stimulated emission of massless bosons by a relativistic and the CGHS
black hole are studied for real and complex scalar fields. The radiations
induced by one-particle and thermal states are considered and their thermal
properties investigated near the horizon. These exhibit both thermal and
non-thermal properties for the two black-hole models.
