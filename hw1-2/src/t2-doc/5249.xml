Super Yang-Mills Theory on Noncommutative Torus from Open Strings
  Interactions

<abstract>
  Considering the scattering of massless open strings attached to a D2-brane
living in the $B$ field background, we show that corresponding scattering upto
the order of $\a'^2$ is exactly given by the gauge theory on noncommutative
background, which is characterized by the Moyal bracket.
