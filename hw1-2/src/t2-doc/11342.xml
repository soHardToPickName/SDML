Quantum Braided Poincar\'E Group
</title>

<abstract>
  A new deformation of the of the Poincar\'e group and of the Minkowski
space-time is given. From the mathematical point of view this deformation is
rather quantum-braided group. Global and local structure of this
quantum-braided Poincar\'e group is investigated. A kind of ``quantum metrics''
is introduced in the $q$-Minkowski space.
