Quantum principal commutative subalgebra in the nilpotent part of
  $U_q\widehat{s\ell}_2$ and lattice KdV variables
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a quantum lattice version of Feigin and E. Frenkel's
constructions, identifying the KdV differential polynomials with functions on a
homogeneous space under the nilpotent part of $\widehat{s\ell}_2$. We construct
an action of the nilpotent part $U_q\widehat n_+$ of $U_q\widehat{s\ell}_2$ on
their lattice counterparts, and embed the lattice variables in a $U_q\widehat
n_+$-module, coinduced from a quantum version of the principal commutative
subalgebra, which is defined using the identification of $U_q\widehat n_+$ with
its coordinate algebra.
