On the Multi Trace Superpotential and Corresponding Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study N=1 supersymmetric U(N) gauge theory coupled to an adjoint scalar
superfiled with a cubic superpotential containing a multi trace term. We show
that the field theory results can be reproduced from a matrix model which its
potential is given in terms of a linearized potential obtained from the gauge
theory superpotential by adding some auxiliary nondynamical field. Once we get
the effective action from this matrix model we could integrate out the
auxiliary field getting the correct field theory results.
