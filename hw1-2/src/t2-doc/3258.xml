General BPS Black Holes In Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct general static black hole configuration for the theory of N=2,
d=5 supergravity coupled to an arbitrary number of Abelian vector multiplets.
The underlying very special geometry structure plays a major role in this
construction. From the viewpoint of M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau
threefold, these black holes are identified with BPS winding states of the
membrane around 2-cycles of the Calabi-Yau threefold, and thus are of
importance in the probing of the phase transitions in the moduli space of
M-theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold.
