`Desert' in Energy or Transverse Space?
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the issue of string and compactification scales in the weak-coupling
regimes of string theory. I explain how in the Brane World scenario a
(effectively) two-dimensional transverse space that is hierarchically larger
than the string length may replace the conventional `energy desert' described
by renormalizable supersymmetric QFT. I comment on the puzzle of unification in
this context.
