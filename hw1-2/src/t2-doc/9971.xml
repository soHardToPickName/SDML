Effective Potential in String Induced Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamical properties of the gauge theory of Born-Infeld type action,
which is expected as the high-energy effective theory, are investigated by
adding a complex scalar field to this gauge system. Especially the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism is addressed in this theory.
