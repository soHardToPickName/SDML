Four-dimensional supersymmetric dyonic black holes in eleven-dimensional
  supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of 4-dimensional supersymmetric dyonic black hole solutions that
arise in an effective 11-dimensional supergravity compactified on a 7-torus is
presented. We give the explicit form of dyonic solutions with diagonal internal
metric, associated with the Kaluza-Klein sector as well as the three-form
field, and relate them to a class of solutions with a general internal metric
by imposing a subset of $SO(7)\subset E_7$ transformations. We also give the
field transformations which relate the above configurations to 4-dimensional
ground state configurations of Ramond-Ramond and Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz
sector of type-IIA strings on a 6-torus.
