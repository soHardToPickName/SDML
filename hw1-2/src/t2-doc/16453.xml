Axial and gauge anomalies in the field antifield quantization of the
  generalized Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  In the generalized Schwinger model the vector and axial vector currents are
linearly coupled, with arbitrary coefficients, to the gauge connection.
Therefore it represents an interesting example of a theory where both gauge
anomalies and anomalous diver gences of global currents show up in general. We
derive results for these two kinds of quantum corrections inside the field
antifield framework.
