The Mini-Superspace Limit of the SL(2,C)/SU(2)-WZNW Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Many qualitatively new features of WZNW models associated to noncompact
cosets are due to zero modes with continuous spectrum. Insight may be gained by
reducing the theory to its zero-mode sector, the mini-superspace limit. This
will be discussed in some detail for the example of SL(2,C)/SU(2)-WZNW model.
The mini-superspace limit of this model can be formulated as baby-CFT.
Spectrum, structure constants and fusion rules as well as factorization of four
point functions are obtained from the harmonic analysis on SL(2,C)/SU(2). The
issues of operator-state correspondence or the appearance of non-normalizable
intermediate states in correlation functions can be discussed transparently in
this context.
