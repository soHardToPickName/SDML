Gaugeon Formalism with BRST Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a BRST symmetric version of Yokoyama's Type I gaugeon formalism
for quantum electrodynamics; the similar theory by Izawa can be considered as a
BRST symmetrized Type II theory. With the help of the BRST symmetry, Yokoyama's
physical subsidiary conditions are replaced by the Kugo-Ojima type condition.
As a result, the formalism becomes applicable even in the background
gravitational field. We show how the Hilbert spaces of standard formalism in
various gauges are embedded in the single Hilbert space of the present
formalism. We also give a path integral derivation of the Lagrangian.
