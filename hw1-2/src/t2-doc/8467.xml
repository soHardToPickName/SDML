Dirac Operator on a disk with global boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the functional determinant for a Dirac operator in the presence of
an Abelian gauge field on a bidimensional disk, under global boundary
conditions of the type introduced by Atiyah-Patodi-Singer. We also discuss the
connection between our result and the index theorem.
