Bogolubov's chain of equations method for temperature Wightman functions
  in thermodynamics of relativistic phase transition

<abstract>
  Bogolubov's chain of equations method for temperature Wightman functions is
suggested for investigation of relativistic phase transition. The chain
equations for the Wightman functions forming momentum--energy tensor are
obtained. It is clarified that structure of the chain equations determines the
basis approximation (the Hartree - Fock approximation) and corrections
calculation algorithm. The basis approximation is investigated in details:
renormalized equations for effective masses, order parameter and generating
functional which reproduce those equations are obtained. Being considered on
the solution of the gap equations for the effective masses the generating
functional turns to nonequilibrium functional of free energy density, which
allows to obtain phases stability conditions. Thermodynamic observables like
heat capacity and sonic speed are calculated. The correction to the
Hartree-Fock approximations is ascertained to be small for all temperatures
excluding vicinity of the phases equilibrium point.
