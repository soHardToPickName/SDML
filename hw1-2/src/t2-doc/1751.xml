Symmetries and Observables for BF-theories in Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric version of a topological quantum field theory describing
flat connections, the super BF-theory, is studied in the superspace formalism.
A set of observables related to topological invariants is derived from the
curvature of the superspace. Analogously to the non-supersymmetric versions,
the theory exhibits a vector-like supersymmetry. The role of the vector
supersymmetry and an additional new symmetry of the action in the construction
of observables is explained.
