Boundary Superpotentials
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we work out explicit lagrangians describing superpotential
coupling to the boundary of a 5D orientifold, as relevant to a number of
quasi-realistic models of nature. We also make a number of general comments on
orientifold compactifications of M theory.
