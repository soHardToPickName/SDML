Stochastic Tachyon Fluctuations, Marginal Deformations and Shock Waves
  in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with exact solutions to string theory on curved spacetimes we obtain
deformations that represent gravitational shock waves. These may exist in the
presence or absence of sources. Sources are effectively induced by a tachyon
field that randomly fluctuates around a zero condensate value. It is shown that
at the level of the underlying conformal field theory (CFT) these deformations
are marginal and moreover all \a'-corrections are taken into account. Explicit
results are given when the original undeformed 4-dimensional backgrounds
correspond to tensor products of combinations of 2-dimensional CFT's, for
instance SL(2,R)/R \times SU(2)/U(1).
