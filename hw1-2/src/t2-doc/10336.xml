Light-like (2,0) Noncommutativity and Light-Cone Rigid Open Membrane
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The six-dimensional (2,0) field theory admits a generalized
``noncommutative'' deformation associated with turning on a large null 3-form
field strength. This theory is studied using its discrete light-cone
formulation as quantum mechanics on a blow-up of the ADHM moduli space. We show
how to interpret the ADHM manifold as configurations of open membranes, and
check our results against basic space-time considerations.
