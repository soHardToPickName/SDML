Light-cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter space-time and
  AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-cone form of field dynamics in anti-de Sitter space-time is developed.
Using field theoretic and group theoretic approaches the light-cone
representation for generators of anti-de Sitter algebra acting as differential
operators on bulk fields is found. We also present light-cone reformulation of
the boundary conformal field theory representations. Making use of these
explicit representations of AdS algebra as isometry algebra in the bulk and the
algebra of conformal transformations at the boundary a precise correspondence
between the bulk fields and the boundary operators is established.
