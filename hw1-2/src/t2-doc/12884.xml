Superfield quantization of general gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A superfield version on superspace $(x^\mu,\theta^a)$ is proposed for the
$Sp(2)$-- covariant Lagrangian quantization of general gauge theories. The
BRST- and antiBRST- transformations are realized on superfields as
supertranslations in the $\theta^a$-- directions. A new (geometric)
interpretation of the Ward identities in the quantum gauge theory is given.
