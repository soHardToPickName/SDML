Massless and Massive Monopoles Carrying Nonabelian Magnetic Charges
</title>

<abstract>
  The properties of BPS monopoles carrying nonabelian magnetic charges are
investigated by following the behavior of the moduli space of solutions as the
Higgs field is varied from a value giving a purely abelian symmetry breaking to
one that leaves a nonabelian subgroup of the gauge symmetry unbroken. As the
limit of nonabelian unbroken symmetry is reached, some of the fundamental
abelian monopoles remain massive but acquire nonabelian magnetic charges. The
BPS mass formula indicates that others should because massless in this limit.
These do not correspond to distinct solitons, but instead are manifested as a
``nonabelian cloud'' surrounding the massive monopoles, with their position and
phase degrees of freedom being transformed into parameters characterizing the
cloud.
