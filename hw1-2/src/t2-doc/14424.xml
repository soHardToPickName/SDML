Flows and Duality Symmetries in N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present more examples of dual N=1 SUSY gauge theories. This set of
theories is connected by flows to both Seiberg's and Kutasov's dual theories.
This provides a unifying picture of the various dual theories. We investigate
the dual theories, their flat directions and mass perturbations.
