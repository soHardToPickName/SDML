Flat structure for the simple elliptic singularity of type $\widetilde
  {\bf E_6}$ and Jacobi form
</title>

  In order to construct the inverse mapping of the period mapping for the
primitive form for the semi-universal deformation of a simple elliptic
singularity, K.Saito introduced in [5] the ``flat structure'' for the extended
affine root system. In section 3, we construct explicitly the flat theta
invariants in the case of type $E_6$ using the Jacobi form introduced by
Wirthm\"uller [7]. Combining the results of Kato [3], Noumi [4] (explicit
description of the flat coordinates), this gives an answer to Jacobi's
inversion problem (up to linear isomorphism) of this period mapping for a
simple elliptic singularity of type $\tilde E_6$ (see also [6]). The details
will be published elsewhere.
