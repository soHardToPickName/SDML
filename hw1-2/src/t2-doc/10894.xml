A Remark On Field Theories On The Non-Commutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate field theories on the non-commutative torus upon varying
theta, the parameter of non-commutativity. We argue that one should think of
Morita equivalence as a symmetry of algebras describing the same space rather
than of theories living on different spaces (as is T-duality). Then we give
arguments why physical observables depend on theta non-continuously.
