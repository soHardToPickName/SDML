Realization of Brane Descent Relations in Effective Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine Sen's descent relations among (non-)BPS D-branes by using low
energy effective field theories of DpDpbar system. We find that the fluctuation
around the kink solution reproduces the low energy matter content on a non-BPS
D(p-1)-brane. The effective action for these fluctuation modes turns out to be
a generalization of Minahan-Zwiebach model. In addition, it is shown that the
fluctuations around the vortex solution consist of massless fields on a BPS
D(p-2)-brane and they are subject to Dirac-Born-Infeld action. We find the
universality that the above results do not refer to particular forms of the
effective action.
