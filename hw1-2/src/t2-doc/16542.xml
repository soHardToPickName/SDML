Correlation functions in a cascading N=1 gauge theory from supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study fluctuations around the warped conifold supergravity solution of
Klebanov and Tseytlin [hep-th/0002159], known to be dual to a cascading N=1
gauge theory. Although this supergravity background is not asymptotically AdS,
corresponding to a non-conformal field theory, it is possible to apply the
usual methods of AdS/CFT duality to extract the high energy behavior of field
theory correlators by solving linearized equations of motion for fluctuations
around the background. We consider the Goldstone vector dual to the anomalous
R-symmetry current and compute its mass, which exactly matches the general
prediction of [hep-th/0009156]. We find the high energy 2-point functions for
the R-current and two other vectors. As expected, the R-current 2-point
function has a longitudinal part because R-symmetry is broken. We also
calculate the high energy 2-point function of the energy-momentum tensor from
fluctuations of modes in the graviton sector. This 2-point function has a trace
part corresponding to broken conformal symmetry.
