Comments on Large N Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The large N Matrix model is studied with attention to the quantum
fluctuations around a given diagonal background. Feynman rules are explicitly
derived and their relation to those in usual Yang-Mills theory is discussed.
Background D-instanton configuration is naturally identified as a
discretization of momentum space of a corresponding QFT. The structure of large
N divergence is also studied on the analogy of UV divergences in QFT.
