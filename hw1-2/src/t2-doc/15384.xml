Black Holes in Two Dimensional Dilaton Gravity and Nonlinear
  Klein-Gordon Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional dilaton gravity coupled to a Klein-Gordon matter field with a
quartic interaction term is considered. The theory has a classical solution
which exhibits black hole formation by a soliton. The geometry of black hole
induced by a soliton is investigated.
