Three dimensional Conformal Field Theories from Sasakian seven-manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the construction of the candidate conformal field theories dual to
$AdS_4$ non-maximally supersymmetric compactifications of 11D supergravity. We
compare the spectra of the two theories and discuss the realization of the
baryonic symmetries. Finally we comment on the presence in the spectrum of long
multiplets with rational energies, trying to explain their existence.
