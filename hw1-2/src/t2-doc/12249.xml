Non-maximally symmetric D-branes on group manifold in the Lagrangian
  approach
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg introduced non-maximally symmetric
boundary states on group manifold using T-duality. In the work presented here
we suggest simple description of these branes in terms of group elements. We
show that T-dualization actually reduces to multiplication of conjugacy classes
by the corresponding U(1) subgroups. Using this description we find the
two-form trivializing the WZW three-form on the branes. SU(2) and $SL(2,R)$
examples are considered in details.
