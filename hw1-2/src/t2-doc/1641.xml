Schwinger terms in two-dimensional gravitation and Kallen's method
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the gravitational Schwinger terms for the specific
two-dimensional model of Weyl fermions in a gravitational background field
using a technique introduced by Kallen and find a relation which connects the
Schwinger terms with the linearized gravitational anomalies.
