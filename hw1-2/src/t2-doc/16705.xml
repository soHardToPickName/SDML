Tachyon Condensation and the Emergence of Fermionic Strings from the
  Bosonic String
</title>

<abstract>
  The results conjectured here are based on tachyon condensation in
compactified bosonic strings. They can in fact be proven from compactification
alone, but this step was not treated consistently here. The proof is given in a
new version of the paper: hep-th/0106235
