Linear equations of motion for massless particles of any spin in any
  even dimensional spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  It is proven that the Poincare symmetry determines equations of motion, which
are for massless particles of any spin in d-dimensional spaces linear in the
momentum. The proof is made only for even d and for fields with no gauge
symmetry. We comment on a few examples. We pay attention only to spin degrees
of freedom.
