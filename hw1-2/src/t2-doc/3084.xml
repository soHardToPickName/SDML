String and Brane Tensions as Dynamical Degrees of Freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a new class of string and p-brane models where the string/brane
tension appears as an additional dynamical degree of freedom instead of being
introduced by hand as an ad hoc dimensionfull scale. The latter property turns
out to have a significant impact on the string/brane dynamics. The dynamical
tension obeys Maxwell (or Yang-Mills) equations of motion (in the string case)
or their rank p gauge theory analogues (in the p-brane case), which in
particular triggers a simple classical mechanism of (``color'') charge
confinement.
