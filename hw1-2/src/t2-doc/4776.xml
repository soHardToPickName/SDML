Non-abelian Dyons
</title>

<abstract>
  The dyonic quantum states of magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theory
with a non-abelian unbroken gauge group display a subtle interplay between
magnetic and electric properties. This is described in detail in the theory
with the gauge group SU(3) broken to U(2), and shown to be captured by the
representation theory of the semi-direct product of U(2) with R^4. The
implications of this observation for the fusion rules and electric-magnetic
duality properties of dyonic states are pointed out.
