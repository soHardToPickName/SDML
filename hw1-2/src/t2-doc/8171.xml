Construction of the classical $R$-matrices for the Toda and Calogero
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the definition of the Calogero-Moser models as Hamiltonian reductions
of geodesic motions on a group manifold to construct their $R$-matrices. In the
Toda case, the analogous construction yields constant $R$-matrices. By
contrast, for Calogero-Moser models they are dynamical objects.
