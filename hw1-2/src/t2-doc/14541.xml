On the Equivalence of Affine sl(2) and N=2 Superconformal Representation
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  There exist two different languages, the ^sl(2) and N=2 ones, to describe
similar structures; a dictionary is given translating the key
representation-theoretic terms related to the two algebras. The main tool to
describe the structure of ^sl(2) and N=2 modules is provided by diagrams of
extremal vectors. The ^sl(2) and N=2 representation theories of certain
highest-weight types turn out to be equivalent modulo the respective spectral
flows.
