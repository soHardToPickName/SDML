Fuzzy Mass Relations for the Higgs
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-commutative approach of the standard model produces a relation
between the top and the Higgs masses. We show that, for a given top mass, the
Higgs mass is constrained to lie in an interval. The length of this interval is
of the order of $m_\tau^2/m_t$.
