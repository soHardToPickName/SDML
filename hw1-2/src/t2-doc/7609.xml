Comments on String Dynamics in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the singularities in the moduli space of string compactifications
to six dimensions with $N=1$ supersymmetry. Such singularities arise from
either massless particles or non-critical tensionless strings. The points with
tensionless strings are sometimes phase transition points between different
phases of the theory. These results appear to connect all known $N=1$
supersymmetric six-dimensional vacua.
