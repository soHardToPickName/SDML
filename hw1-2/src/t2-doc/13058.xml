Relations between some analytic representations of one-loop scalar
  integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare several parametrized analytic expressions for an arbitrary
off-shell one-loop $n$-point function in scalar field theory in $D$-dimensional
space-time, and show their equivalence both directly and through path-integral
methods.
