New equations for vacuum correlators in gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Stochastic quantization is applied to derivation of equations connecting
multilocal gauge-invariant correlators in different field theories. They
include Abelian Higgs Model, QCD with spinless quarks at T=0 and T>0 and QED,
where spin effects are taken into account exactly.
