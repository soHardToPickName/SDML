The Conformal Points of the Generalized Thirring Model II
</title>

<abstract>
  In the large N limit, conditions for the conformal invariance of the
generalized Thirring model are derived, using two different approaches: the
background field method and the Hamiltonian method based on an operator
algebra, and the agreement between them is established. A free field
representation of the relevant algebra is presented, and the structure of the
stress tensor in terms of free fields (and free currents) is studied in detail.
