Quantum Fields at Any Time

  The canonical quantum theory of a free field using arbitrary foliations of a
flat two-dimensional spacetime is investigated. It is shown that dynamical
evolution along arbitrary spacelike foliations is unitarily implemented on the
same Fock space as that associated with inertial foliations. It follows that
the Schrodinger picture exists for arbitrary foliations as a unitary image of
the Heisenberg picture for the theory. An explicit construction of the
Schrodinger picture image of the Heisenberg Fock space states is provided. The
results presented here can be interpreted in terms of a Dirac constraint
quantization of parametrized field theory. In particular, it is shown that the
Schrodinger picture physical states satisfy a functional Schrodinger equation
which includes a slice-dependent c-number quantum correction, in accord with a
proposal of Kuchar. The spatial diffeomorphism invariance of the Schrodinger
picture physical states is established. Fundamental difficulties arise when
trying to generalize these results to higher-dimensional spacetimes.
