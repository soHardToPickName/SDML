Three Body Bound State in Non-Commutative Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The Bethe-Salpeter equation in non-commutative QED (NCQED) is considered for
three-body bound state. We study the non-relativistic limit of this equation in
the instantaneous approximation and derive the corresponding Schr\"{o}dinger
equation in non-commutative space. It is shown that the experimental data for
Helium atom puts an upper bound on the magnitude of the parameter of
non-commutativity, $\theta\sim10^{-9}\lambda_e^2$.
