A Nonsingular Two Dimensional Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a model of gravity in 1+1 spacetime dimensions in which the
solutions approach the Schwarzschild metric at large $r$ and de Sitter space
far inside the horizon. Our model may be viewed as a two dimensional
application of the `Limiting Curvature Construction' recently proposed by two
of the authors.
