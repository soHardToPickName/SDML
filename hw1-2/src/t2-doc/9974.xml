Quantum equivalence of sigma models related by non Abelian Duality
  Transformations

<abstract>
  Coupling constant renormalization is investigated in 2 dimensional sigma
models related by non Abelian duality transformations. In this respect it is
shown that in the one loop order of perturbation theory the duals of a one
parameter family of models, interpolating between the SU(2) principal model and
the O(3) sigma model, exhibit the same behaviour as the original models. For
the O(3) model also the two loop equivalence is investigated, and is found to
be broken just like in the already known example of the principal model.
