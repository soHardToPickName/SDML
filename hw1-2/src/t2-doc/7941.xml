Higher-Derivative Supersymmetry and the Witten Index
</title>

<abstract>
  Higher-derivative generalization of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics is
proposed. It is formally based on the standard superalgebra but supercharges
involve differential operators of the order $n$. As a result, their
anticommutator entails polynomial of a Hamiltonian. The Witten index does not
characterize spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in such models.
