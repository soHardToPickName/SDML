Effective field theories of non-equilibrium physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Non equilibrium effective field theory is presented as an inhomogeneous field
theory, using a formulation which is analogous to that of a gauge theory. This
formulation underlines the importance of structural aspects of non-equilibrium,
effective field theories. It is shown that, unless proper attention is paid to
such structural features, hugely different answers can be obtained for a given
model. The exactly soluble two-level atom is used as an example of both the
covariant methodology and of the conclusions.
