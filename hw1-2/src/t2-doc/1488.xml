WZNW Models and Gauged WZNW Models Based on a Family of Solvable Lie
  Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  A family of solvable self-dual Lie algebras that are not double extensions of
Abelian algebras and, therefore, cannot be obtained through a Wigner
contraction, is presented. We construct WZNW and gauged WZNW models based on
the first two algebras in this family. We also analyze some general phenomena
arising in such models.
