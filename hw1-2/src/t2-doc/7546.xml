Infinite Statistics and Black Holes in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The concept of infinite statistics is applied to the analysis of black hole
thermodynamics in Matrix Theory. It is argued that Matrix Theory partons,
D0-branes, satisfy quantum infinite statistics, and that this observation
justifies the recently proposed Boltzmann gas model of Schwarzschild black
holes in Matrix Theory.
