Probability representation in quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently proposed probability representation of quantum mechanics is
generalized to quantum field theory. We introduce a probability distribution
functional for field configurations and find an evolution equation for such a
distribution. The connection to the time-dependent generating functional of
Green's functions is elucidated and the classical limit is discussed.
