Incompatibility of Self-Charge Conjugation with Helicity Eigenstates and
  Gauge Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this essay, an {\it ab initio} study of the self/anti-self charge
conjugate $(1/2,\,0)\oplus(0,\,1/2)$ representation space is presented.
Incompatibility of self/anti-self charge conjugation with helicity eigenstates
and gauge interactions is demonstrated. Parity violation is seen as an
intrinsic part of the self/anti-self charge conjugate construct. From a
phenomenological point of view, an essential part of the theory is the
Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type boson, where a boson and its antiboson carry
opposite relative intrinsic parity.
