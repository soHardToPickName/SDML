Regularization Ambiguity Problem for the Chern-Simons Shift
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Chern-Simons parameter shift with the hybrid regularization
consisting of the higher covariant derivative (HCD) and the Pauli-Villars (PV)
regulators. We show that the shift is closely related to the parity of the
regulators and get the shift and no-shift results by a suitable choice of the
PV regulators. A naive treatment of the HCD term leads incorrect value of the
shift.
