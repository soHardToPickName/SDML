Free and self-interacting scalar fields in the presence of conical
  singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  Free and self-interacting scalar fields in the presence of conical
singularities are analized in some detail. The role of such a kind of
singularities on free and vacuum energy and also on the one-loop effective
action is pointed out using $\zeta$-function regularization and heat-kernel
techniques.
