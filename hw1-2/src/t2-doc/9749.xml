Dimensional regularization of a compact dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  An extension of dimensional regularization to the case of compact dimensions
is presented. The procedure preserves the Kaluza-Klein tower structure, but has
a regulator specific to the compact dimension. Possible 5 and 4 dimensional
divergent as well as manifest finite contributions of (one-loop) Feynman graphs
can easily be identified in this scheme.
