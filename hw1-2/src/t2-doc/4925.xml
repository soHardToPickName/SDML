(Non) singular Kantowski-Sachs Universe from quantum spherically reduced
  matter

  Using s-wave and large N approximation the one-loop effective action for 2d
dilaton coupled scalars and spinors which are obtained by spherical reduction
of 4d minimal matter is found. Quantum effective equations for reduced Einstein
gravity are written. Their analytical solutions corresponding to 4d
Kantowski-Sachs (KS) Universe are presented. For quantum-corrected Einstein
gravity we get non-singular KS cosmology which represents 1) quantum-corrected
KS cosmology which existed on classical level or 2)purely quantum solution
which had no classical limit. The analogy with Nariai BH is briefly mentioned.
For purely induced gravity (no Einstein term) we found general analytical
solution but all KS cosmologies under discussion are singular. The
corresponding equations of motion are reformulated as classical mechanics
problem of motion of unit mass particle in some potential V.
