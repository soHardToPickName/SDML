Generalized Conformal Symmetry and Oblique AdS/CFT Correspondence for
  Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The large N behavior of Matrix theory is discussed on the basis of the
previously proposed generalized conformal symmetry. The concept of `oblique'
AdS/CFT correspondence, in which the conformal symmetry involves both the
space-time coordinates and the string coupling constant, is proposed. Based on
the explicit predictions for two-point correlators, possible implications for
the Matrix-theory conjecture are discussed.
