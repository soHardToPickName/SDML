Holonomy from wrapped branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Compactifications of M-theory on manifolds with reduced holonomy arise as the
local eleven-dimensional description of D6-branes wrapped on supersymmetric
cycles in manifolds of lower dimension with a different holonomy group.
Whenever the isometry group SU(2) is present, eight-dimensional gauged
supergravity is a natural arena for such investigations. In this paper we use
this approach and review the eleven dimensional description of D6-branes
wrapped on coassociative 4-cycles, on deformed 3-cycles inside Calabi-Yau
threefolds and on Kahler 4-cycles.
