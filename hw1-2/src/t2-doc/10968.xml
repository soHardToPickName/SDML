Susy Cosmological Models
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we consider the action for a set of complex scalar
supermultiplets interacting with the scale factor in the supersymmetric
cosmological models. We show that the local conformal supersymmetry leads to a
scalar field potential defined in terms of the K\"ahler potential and
superpotential. Using supersymmetry breaking we are able to obtain a
normalizable wave function for the FRW cosmological model.
