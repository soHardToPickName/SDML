Light-Ray Radon Transform for Abelianin and Nonabelian Connection in 3
  and 4 Dimensional Space with Minkowsky Metric
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a real manifold of dimension 3 or 4 with Minkovsky metric, and
with a connection for a trivial GL(n,C) bundle over that manifold. To each
light ray on the manifold we assign the data of paralel transport along that
light ray. It turns out that these data are not enough to reconstruct the
connection, but we can add more data, which depend now not from lines but from
2-planes, and which in some sence are the data of parallel transport in the
complex light-like directions, then we can reconstruct the connection up to a
gauge transformation. There are some interesting applications of the
construction: 1) in 4 dimensions, the self-dual Yang Mills equations can be
written as the zero curvature condition for a pair of certain first order
differential operators; one of the operators in the pair is the covariant
derivative in complex light-like direction we studied. 2) there is a relation
of this Radon transform with the supersymmetry. 3)using our Radon transform,
we can get a measure on the space of 2 dimensional planes in 4 dimensional real
space. Any such measure give rise to a Crofton 2-density. The integrals of this
2-density over surfaces in R^4 give rise to the Lagrangian for maps of
real surfaces into R^4, and therefore to some string theory. 4)
there are relations with the representation theory. In particular, a closely
related transform in 3 dimensions can be used to get the Plancerel formula for
representations of SL(2,R).
