Linear and Chiral Superfields are Usefully Inequivalent
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral superfields have been used, and extensively, almost ever since
supersymmetry has been discovered. Complex linear superfields afford an
alternate representation of matter, but are widely misbelieved to be
'physically equivalent' to chiral ones. We prove the opposite is true.
Curiously, this re-enables a previously thwarted interpretation of the
low-energy (super)field limit of superstrings.
