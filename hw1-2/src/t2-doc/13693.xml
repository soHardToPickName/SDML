Algorithms for the calculation of the heat kernel coefficients
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief overview of several approaches for calculating the local
asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel for Laplace-type operators. The
different methods developed in the papers of both authors some time ago are
described in more detail.
