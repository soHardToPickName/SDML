N = 2 conformal field theories from M2-branes at conifold singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We make some comments on the derivation of N=2 super-conformal field theories
with smooth gauge group from M2-branes placed at conifold singularities, giving
a detailed prescription for two specific examples: the singular cones over the
Q^{111} and M^{110} manifolds.
