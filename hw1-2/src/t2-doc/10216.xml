An Operator Approach To String Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, a new approach to string dynamics is proposed. String
coordinates are identified with a non-commuting set of operators familiar from
free string quantization, and the dynamics follows from the Virasoro algebra.
There is a very large gauge group operating on the non-commuting coordinates.
The gauge has to be fixed suitably to make contact with the standard string
picture.
