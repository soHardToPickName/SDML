One-Loop Effective Action for Spherical Scalar Field Collapse
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the complete one-loop effective action for a spherical scalar
field collapse in the large radius approximation. This action gives the
complete trace anomaly, which beside the matter loop contributions, receives a
contribution from the graviton loops. Our result opens a possibility for a
systematic study of the back-reaction effects for a real black hole.
