Large N wormhole approach to spacetime foam
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple model of spacetime foam, made by $N$ wormholes in a semiclassical
approximation, is taken under examination. We show that the qualitative
behaviour of the fluctuation of the metric conjectured by Wheeler is here
reproduced.
