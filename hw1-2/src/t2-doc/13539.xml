Dilaton Gravity Coupled to a Nonlinear Sigma Model in $2+\epsilon$
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum theory of dilaton gravity coupled to a nonlinear sigma model with a
maximally symmetric target space is studied in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. The
ultraviolet stable fixed point for the curvature of the nonlinear sigma model
demands a new fixed point theory for the dilaton coupling function. The fixed
point of the dilaton coupling is a saddle point similarly to the previous case
of the flat target space.
