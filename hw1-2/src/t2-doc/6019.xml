(Anti-) de Sitter Black Holes in higher derivative gravity and dual
  Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Thermodynamics of five-dimensional Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (SAdS) and
SdS black holes in the particular model of higher derivative gravity is
considered. The free energy, mass (thermodynamical energy) and entropy are
evaluated. There exists the parameters region where BH entropy is zero or
negative. The arguments are given that corresponding BH solutions are not
stable. We also present the FRW-equations of motion of time (space)-like branes
in SAdS or SdS BH background. The properties of dual CFT are discussed and it
is shown that it has zero Casimir energy when BH entropy (effective
gravitational constant) is zero. The Cardy-Verlinde formula for CFT dual to
SAdS or SdS BH is found in the universal form.
