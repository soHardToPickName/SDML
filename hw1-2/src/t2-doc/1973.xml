Actions for Integrable Systems and Deformed Conformal Theories

  I report on work on a Lagrangian formulation for the simplest 1+1 dimensional
integrable hierarchies. This formulation makes the relationship between
conformal field theories and (quantized) 1+1 dimensional integrable hierarchies
very clear.
