String Solutions to Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the comlete solution to ten-dimensional supergravity coupled to a
three-form field strength, given the ``standard ansatz" for the fields, and
show that in addition to the well-known elementary and solitonic (heterotic)
string solutions, one of the possibilities is an (unstable) elementary type I
string solution.
