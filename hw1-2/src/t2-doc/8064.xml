Noncommutative and Ordinary Super Yang-Mills on (D$(p-2)$, D$p$) Bound
  States

  We study properties of (D$(p-2)$, D$p$) nonthreshold bound states ($2 \le p
\le 6 $) in the dual gravity description. These bound states can be viewed as
D$p$-branes with a nonzero NS $B$ field of rank two. We find that in the
decoupling limit, the thermodynamics of the $N_p$ coincident D$p$-branes with
$B$ field is the same not only as that of $N_p$ coincident D$p$-branes without
$B$ field, but also as that of the $N_{p-2}$ coincident D$(p-2)$-branes with
two smeared coordinates and no $B$ field, for $N_{p-2}/N_p=
\tilde{V}_2/[(2\pi)^2 \tilde{b}]$ with $\tilde{V}_2$ being the area of the two
smeared directions and $\tilde{b}$ a noncommutativity parameter. We also obtain
the same relation from the thermodynamics and dynamics by probe methods. This
suggests that the noncommutative super Yang-Mills with gauge group $U(N_p)$ in
($p+1$) dimensions is equivalent to an ordinary one with gauge group
$U(\infty)$ in ($p-1$) dimensions in the limit $\tilde{V}_2 \to \infty$. We
also find that the free energy of a D$p$-brane probe with $B$ field in the
background of D$p$-branes with $B$ field coincides with that of a D$p$-brane
probe in the background of D$p$-branes without $B$ field.
