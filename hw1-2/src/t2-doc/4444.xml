Quantum aspects of Seiberg-Witten map in noncommutative Chern-Simons
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncommutative Chern-Simons theory can be classically mapped to commutative
Chern-Simons theory by the Seiberg-Witten map. We provide evidence that the
equivalence persists at the quantum level by computing two and three-point
functions of field strengths on the commutative side and their Seiberg-Witten
transforms on the noncommutative side to the first nontrivial order in
perturbation theory.
