Three-Pronged Strings and 1/4 BPS States in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide an explicit construction of 1/4 BPS states in four-dimensional N=4
Super-Yang-Mills theory with a gauge group SU(3). These states correspond to
three-pronged strings connecting three D3-branes. We also find curves of
marginal stability in the moduli space of the theory, at which the above states
can decay into two 1/2 BPS states.
