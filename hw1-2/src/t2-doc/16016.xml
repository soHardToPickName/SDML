Gauge models in modified triplectic quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the modified triplectic formalism for quantizing several popular
gauge models - non-abelian antisymmetric tensor field model, W2-gravity and
two-dimensional gravity with dynamical torsion. The explicit solutions are
obtained for the generating equations of the quantum action and the
gauge-fixing functional. Using these solutions we construct the vacuum
functional and obtain the corresponding transformations of the extended BRST
symmetry.
