BRST Gauge Fixing and Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  In the presence of consistent regulators, the standard procedure of BRST
gauge fixing (or moving from one gauge to another) can require non-trivial
modifications. These modifications occur at the quantum level, and gauges exist
which are only well-defined when quantum mechanical modifications are correctly
taken into account. We illustrate how this phenomenon manifests itself in the
solvable case of two-dimensional bosonization in the path-integral formalism.
As a by-product, we show how to derive smooth bosonization in
Batalin-Vilkovisky Lagrangian BRST quantization.
