Boundary Effects in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Some of the properties of string theory defined on world-sheets with
boundaries are reviewed. Particular emphasis is put on the possibility of
identifying string configurations (\lq D-instantons' and \lq D-branes') that
give rise to stringy non-perturbative effects.
