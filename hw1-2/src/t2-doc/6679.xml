Quantum Gravity and Black Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  The basic features of a quantum field theory which is Poincar\'e invariant,
gauge invariant, finite and unitary to all orders of perturbation theory are
reviewed. Quantum gravity is finite and unitary to all orders of perturbation
theory. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for a black hole is investigated
in a conical Rindler space approximation to a black hole event horizon. A
renormalization of the gravitational coupling constant is performed leading to
a finite Bekenstein-Hawking entropy at the horizon.
