Quantum Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli Formulae for $U_q(B_r^{(1)})$ from
  Analytic Bethe Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  Analytic Bethe ansatz is executed for a wide class of finite dimensional
$U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ modules. They are labeled by skew-Young diagrams which, in
general, contain a fragment corresponding to the spin representation. For the
transfer matrix spectra of the relevant vertex models, we establish a number of
formulae, which are $U_q(B^{(1)}_r)$ analogues of the classical ones due to
Jacobi-Trudi and Giambelli on Schur functions. They yield a full solution to
the previously proposed functional relation ($T$-system), which is a Toda
equation
