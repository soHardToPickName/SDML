Nonperturbative calculation of symmetry breaking in quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A new version of the delta expansion is presented, which, unlike the
conventional delta expansion, can be used to do nonperturbative calculations in
a self-interacting scalar quantum field theory having broken symmetry. We
calculate the expectation value of the scalar field to first order in delta,
where delta is a measure of the degree of nonlinearity in the interaction term.
