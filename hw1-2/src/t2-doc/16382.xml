Black Holes and U-duality in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we review some properties of BPS black holes of supergravities
with n=32,16 supersymmetries. The BPS condition, a condition on the eigenvalues
of the central charge matrix, can be shown to be U-duality invariant. We
explicitly work out D=4, N=8 and D=5, N=4 supergravities.
