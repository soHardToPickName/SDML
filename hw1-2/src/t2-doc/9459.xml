Monopoles in Space-Time Noncommutative Born-Infeld theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We transform static solutions of space-noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld
theory (DBI) into static solutions of space-time noncommutative DBI. Via
Seiberg-Witten map we match this symmetry transformation with a corresponding
symmetry of commutative DBI. This allows to: 1) study new BPS type magnetic
monopoles, with constant electric and magnetic background and describe them
both in the commutative and in the noncommutative setting; 2) relate by
S-duality space-noncommutative magnetic monopoles to space-noncommutative
electric monopoles
