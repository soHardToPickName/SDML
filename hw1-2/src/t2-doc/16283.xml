Wrapping the M Theory Five-Brane on K3
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a recently constructed M5-brane world-volume action, we demonstrate
that wrapping the M5-brane on K3 gives the heterotic string in seven
dimensions. To facilitate the comparison, a new version of the world-sheet
action for the Narain-compactified heterotic string, with manifest T duality
invariance, is formulated.
