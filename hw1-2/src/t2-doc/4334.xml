Noncommutative QED and Anomalous Dipole Moments
</title>

<abstract>
  We study QED on noncommutative spaces, NCQED. In particular we present the
detailed calculation for the noncommutative electron-photon vertex and show
that the Ward identity is satisfied. We discuss that in the noncommutative case
moving electron will show {\it electric} dipole effects. In addition, we work
out the electric and magnetic dipole moments up to one loop level. For the
magnetic moment we show that noncommutative electron has an intrinsic (spin
independent) magnetic moment.
