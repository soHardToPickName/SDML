The Semiclassical Instability of de Sitter Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The effect of the spontaneous nucleation of black holes in de Sitter space is
reviewed, and the main steps of the calculation in Nucl.Phys. B 582, 313, 2000
of the one-loop amplitude of this process are summarized. The existence of such
an effect suggests that de Sitter space is not a ground state of quantum
gravity with a positive cosmological constant.
