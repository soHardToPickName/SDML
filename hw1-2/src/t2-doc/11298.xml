Pursuing Gravitational S-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently a strong-weak coupling duality in non-abelian non-supersymmetric
theories in four dimensions has been found. An analogous procedure is reviewed,
which allows to find the `dual action' to the gauge theory of dynamical gravity
constructed by the MacDowell-Mansouri model plus the superposition of a
$\Theta$ term.
