Nonanalyticity of the beta-function and systematic errors in
  field-theoretic calculations of critical quantities
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the fixed-dimension perturbative expansion. We discuss the
nonanalyticity of the renormalization-group functions at the fixed point and
its consequences for the numerical determination of critical quantities.
