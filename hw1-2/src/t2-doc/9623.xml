Two AdS2 branes in the Euclidean AdS3
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the density of open strings stretching between AdS2 branes in the
Euclidean AdS3. This is done by solving the factorization constraint of a
degenerate boundary field, and the result is checked by a Cardy-type
computation. We mention applications to branes in the Minkowskian AdS3 and its
cigar coset.
