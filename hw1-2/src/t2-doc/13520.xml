On the relation between polynomial deformations of sl(2,R) and
  quasi-exactly solvability
</title>

<abstract>
  A general method based on the polynomial deformations of the Lie algebra
sl(2,R) is proposed in order to exhibit the quasi-exactly solvability of
specific Hamiltonians implied by quantum physical models. This method using the
finite-dimensional representations and differential realizations of such
deformations is illustrated on the sextic oscillator as well as on the second
harmonic generation.
