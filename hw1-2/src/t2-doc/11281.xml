Exact Solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Some exact static solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory are
presented. These solutions satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations, and
possess infinite energies. They are axially symmetric and could possibly
represent monopoles and an antimonopole sitting on the z-axis.
