Supersymmetric Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action of $N=2$, $d=4$ supergravity is shown to acquire no
quantum corrections in background metrics admitting super-covariantly constant
spinors. In particular, these metrics include the Robinson-Bertotti metric
(product of two 2-dimensional spaces of constant curvature) with all 8
supersymmetries unbroken. Another example is a set of arbitrary number of
extreme Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. These black holes break 4 of 8
supersymmetries, leaving the other 4 unbroken.
  We have found manifestly supersymmetric black holes, which are non-trivial
solutions of the flatness condition $\cd^{2} = 0$ of the corresponding
(shortened) superspace. Their bosonic part describes a set of extreme
Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. The super black hole solutions are exact even
when all quantum supergravity corrections are taken into account.
