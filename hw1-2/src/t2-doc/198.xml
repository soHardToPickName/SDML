Zero-branes in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss zero-brane solutions in three-dimensional Minkowski space-time
annihilated by half of the supersymmetries. The other half of the
supersymmetries which should generate the supersymmetric multiplet are
ill-defined and lead to a non bose-fermi degenerate solitonic spectrum.
