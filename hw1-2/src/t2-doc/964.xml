Energy-Momentum Conservation and Holographic S-Matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the consequence of the energy-momentum conservation law for
the holographic S-matrix from AdS/CFT correspondence. It is shown that the
conservation law is not a natural consequence of conformal invariance in the
large N limit. We predict a new singularity for the four point correlation
function of a marginal operator. Only the two point scattering amplitude is
explicitly calculated, and the result agrees with what is expected.
