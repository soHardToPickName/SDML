On the Bosonic Spectrum of QCD(1+1) with SU(N) Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we calculate the spectrum of two-dimensional QCD. We formulate
the theory with SU(N_c) currents rather than with fermionic operators. We
construct the Hamiltonian matrix in DLCQ formulation as a function of the
harmonic resolution K and the numbers of flavors N_f and colors N_c. The
resulting numerical eigenvalue spectrum is free from trivial multi-particle
states which obscured previous results. The well-known 't Hooft and large N_f
spectra are reproduced. In the case of adjoint fermions we present some new
results.
