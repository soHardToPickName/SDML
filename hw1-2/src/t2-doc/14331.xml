Noncommuting Gauge Fields as a Lagrange Fluid
</title>

<abstract>
  The Lagrange description of an ideal fluid gives rise in a natural way to a
gauge potential and a Poisson structure that are classical precursors of
analogous noncommuting entities. With this observation we are led to construct
gauge-covariant coordinate transformations on a noncommuting space. Also we
recognize the Seiberg-Witten map from noncommuting to commuting variables as
the quantum correspondent of the Lagrange to Euler map in fluid mechanics.
