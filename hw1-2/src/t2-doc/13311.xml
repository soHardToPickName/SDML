Evolution of Pure States into Mixed States
</title>

<abstract>
  In the formulation of Banks, Peskin and Susskind, we show that one can
construct evolution equations for the quantum mechanical density matrix $\rho$
with operators which do not commute with hamiltonian which evolve pure states
into mixed states, preserve the normalization and positivity of $\rho$ and
conserve energy. Furthermore, it seems to be different from a quantum
mechanical system with random sources.
