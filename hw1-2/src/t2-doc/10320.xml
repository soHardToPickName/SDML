The Contribution of Instanton-Antiinstanton Fluctuations to the Ground
  State Energy in Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanical Models
</title>

<abstract>
  I show that the method of finding if the ground state energy is nonzero or
not by saturating the functional integral directly with
instanton-anti-instanton type fluctuations is not reliable either for the
double or for the triple well potential models in supersymmetric quantum
mechanics.
