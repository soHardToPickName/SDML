Product of Boundary Distributions
</title>

<abstract>
  1) We identify new parameter branches for the ultra-local boundary Poisson
bracket in d spatial dimension with a (d-1)-dimensional spatial boundary. There
exist 2^{r(r-1)/2} r-dimensional parameter branches for each d-box, r-row Young
tableau. The already known branch (hep-th/9912017) corresponds to a vertical
1-column, d-box Young tableau. 2) We consider a local distribution product
among the so-called boundary distributions. The product is required to respect
the associativity and the Leibnitz rule. We show that the consistency
requirements on this product correspond to the Jacobi identity conditions for
the boundary Poisson bracket. In other words, the restrictions on forming a
boundary Poisson bracket can be related to the more fundamental distribution
product construction. 3) The definition of the higher functional derivatives is
made independent of the choice of integral kernel representative for a
functional.
