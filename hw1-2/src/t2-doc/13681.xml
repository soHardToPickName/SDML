Comment on 4D Lorentz invariance violations in the brane-world
</title>

<abstract>
  The brane-world scenario offers the possibility for signals to travel outside
our visible universe and reenter it. We find the condition for a signal emitted
from the brane to return to the brane. We study the propagation of such signals
and show that, as seen by a 4D observer, these signals arrive earlier than
light traveling along the brane. We also study the horizon problem and find
that, while the bulk signals can travel far enough to homogenize the visible
universe, it is unlikely that they have a significant effect since they are
redshifted in the gravitational field of the bulk black hole.
