Special Geometry and Compactification on a Circle
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some consequences of our previous work on rigid special geometry
in hypermultiplets in 4-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for supersymmetric
gauge dynamics when one of the spatial dimensions is compactified on a circle.
