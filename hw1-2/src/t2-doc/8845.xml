Some uses of moduli spaces in particle and field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I shall try to give an elementary introduction to certain areas
of mathematical physics where the idea of moduli space is used to help solve
problems or to further our understanding. In the wide area of gauge theory, I
shall mention instantons, monopoles and duality. Then, under the general
heading of string theory, I shall indicate briefly the use of moduli space in
conformal field theory and $M$-theory.
