BPS black holes, supersymmetry and orbits of exceptional groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on duality invariant constraints, which allow a classification of
BPS black holes preserving different fractions of supersymmetry. We then relate
this analysis to the orbits of the exceptional groups $E_{6(6)}, E_{7(7)}$,
relevant for black holes in five and four dimensions.
