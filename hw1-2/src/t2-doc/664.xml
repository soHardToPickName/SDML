Morse potential energy spectra through the variational method and
  supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The Variational Method is applied within the context of Supersymmetric
Quantum Mechanics to provide information about the energy and eigenfunction of
the lowest levels of a Hamiltonian. The approach is illustrated by the case of
the Morse potential applied to several diatomic molecules and the results are
compared with stablished results.
