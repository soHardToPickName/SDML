Topology Change and Nonperturbative Instability of Black Holes in
  Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Topology change in quantum gravity is considered. An exact wave function of
the Universe is calculated for topological Chern-Simons 2+1 dimensional
gravity. This wave function occurs as the effect of a quantum anomaly which
leads to the induced gravity. We find that the wave function depends
universally on the topology of the two-dimensional space. Indeed, the property
of the ground state wave function of Chern-Simons gravity which has an
attractive physical interpretation is that it becomes large in the infrared
(large distances) if the Universe has ``classical'' topology $S^2\times R$. On
the other hand, nonclassical topologies ${\Sigma}_g\times R$, where
${\Sigma}_g$ is the Riemann surface of genus g, are driven by quantum effects
into the Planckian regime (``space-time foam''). The similar behavior of the
quantum gravitational measure on four-manifolds constructed recently is
discussed as the next example. We discuss the new phenomenon of the
nonperturbative instability of black holes discovered recently. One finds that
the Planck- sized black holes are unstable due to topology change. The decay
rate is estimated using the instanton approximation. A possible solution to the
primordial black hole problem in quantum cosmology is suggested.
