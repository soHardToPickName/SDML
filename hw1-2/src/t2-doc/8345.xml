Various Types of Five-Dimensional Warp Factor and Effective Planck Scale
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the assumption that the warp factor of four-dimensional spacetime
and the one of fifth dimension are tied through a parameter $\alpha$, we
consider five-dimensional gravity with a 3-brane coupled to a bulk scalar
field. For arbitrary value of $\alpha$, the form of the warp factor is
implicitly determined by hypergeometric function. Concretely, we show that the
warp factor becomes explicit form for appropriate value of $\alpha$, and study
the relation between four-dimensional effective Planck scale and the brane
tension. This setup allows the possibility of extending the diversity of brane
world.
