Dynamically Favored Chiral Symmetry Breakings in Supersymmetric Quantum
  Chromodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  By the use of an effective superpotential in supersymmetric quantum
chromodynamics (SQCD) with N_f flavors and N_c colors of quarks for N_f>=N_c+2,
the influence of soft supersymmetry (SUSY) breakings is examined to clarify
dynamics of chiral symmetry breakings near the SUSY limit. In case that SQCD
triggers spontaneous chiral symmetry breakings, it is possible to show that our
superpotential dynamically favors the successive formation of condensates,
leaving either SU(N_f-N_c) or SU(N_f-N_c+1) unbroken as a chiral nonabelian
symmetry.
