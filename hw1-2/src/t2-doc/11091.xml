Exactly Solvable Matrix Models for the Dynamical Generation of
  Space-Time in Superstring Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of solvable SO(D) symmetric matrix models with D bosonic
matrices coupled to chiral fermions. The SO(D) symmetry is spontaneously broken
due to the phase of the fermion integral. This demonstrates the conjectured
mechanism for the dynamical generation of four-dimensional space-time in the
IIB matrix model, which was proposed as a nonperturbative definition of type
IIB superstring theory in ten dimensions.
