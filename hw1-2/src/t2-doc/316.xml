Self-Dual Model Coupled to Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigated the dynamics, at the quantum level, of the
self-dual field minimally coupled to bosons. In this investigation we use the
Dirac bracket quantization procedure to quantize the model. Also, the
relativistic invariance is tested in connection with the elastic boson-boson
scattering amplitudes.
