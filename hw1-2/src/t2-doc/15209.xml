More About Partition Function of Open Bosonic String in Background
  Fields and String Theory Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We refine the relation between the renormalized partition function of the
open bosonic string in background fields and the effective action. In the
process, we get some leading derivative corrections to the Born-Infeld action
which include all powers of the gauge field.
