The CP(n) Model on Noncommutative Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the consistent CP(n) model on noncommutative plane. The
Bogomolny bound on the energy is saturated by (anti-)self-dual solitons with
integer topological charge, which is independent of their scaling and
orientation. This integer quantization is satisfied for our general solutions,
which turns out regular everywhere. We discuss the possible implication of our
result to the instanton physics in Yang-Mills theories on noncommutative R^4.
