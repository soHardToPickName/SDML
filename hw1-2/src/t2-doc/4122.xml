Exploring quark-gluon plasma on the loop space
</title>

<abstract>
  Langevin equation describing soft modes in the quark-gluon plasma is
reformulated on the loop space. The Cauchy problem for the resulting loop
equation is solved for the case when the nonvanishing components of the gauge
potential correspond to the Cartan generators of the SU(N)-group and are
proportional to a constant unit vector in the Cartan subalgebra. The
regularized form of the loop equation with an arbitrary gauge potential is
found, and perturbation theory in powers of the 't Hooft coupling is discussed.
