$q$-Virasoro Operators from $q$-Noether Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the $q$-Virasoro algebra based on the arguments of the Noether
currents in a two-dimensional massless fermion theory as well as in a
three-dimensional nonrelativistic one. Some notes on the $q$-differential
operator realization and the central extension are also included.
