Type IIB 2-form Fields and Gauge Coupling Constant of 4D N=2 super QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between the Type IIB (NSNS and RR) 2-form fields and
the (complex) gauge coupling constant of the 4D N=2 SU(Nc) super Yang-Mills
theory with Nf fundamental matters. We start from the analysis of the D2-brane
world volume theory with heavy Nc quarks on the Nf D6 supergravity background.
After a sequence of T- and S-dualities and a likely supposition about the
transformation of the world volume interaction terms, we obtain the 2-forms in
the configuration with Nc D5-branes wrapping on the vanishing two-cycle under
the influence of the background. These 2-forms shows the same behavior as the
gauge coupling constant of the 4D N=2 super QCD. The background reduces to the
Z_{Nf} orbifold in the twelve-dimensional space-time formally realized by
introducing the two parameters as the additional space coordinates. In the case
of Nf= 2Nc, the gravity solution in this space-time becomes locally AdS_5 times
S^5/Z_2 \times R^2 with the Z_{Nf} orbifold identification and has the constant
NSNS 2-form dependent D3-charge, as expected from the M-theory QCD
configuration. Based on the known exact result, we also discuss this
configuration after including the nonperturbative effect.
