``Theory of Theories'' Approach to String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new formulation of gauge theories as a quantum theory which has
the gauge theory action $S$ as its dynamical variable. This system is described
by a simple actional $I(S)$ (that is, an action for the action $S$) whose
equation of motion gives the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) master equation for $S$.
Upon quantization we find that our new formulation is reduced to something like
a topological field theory having a BRST exact gauge-fixed actional. Therefore
the present formulation can reproduce ordinary gauge theories since the
path-integral over $S$ is dominated by the classical configuration which
satisfies the BV master equation. This ``theory of theories'' formulation is
intended to be applied to closed string field theory.
