Deformation Quantization of Classical Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the deformation quantization of scalar and abelian gauge classical
free fields. Stratonovich-Weyl quantizer, star-products and Wigner functionals
are obtained in field and oscillator variables. Abelian gauge theory is
particularly intriguing since Wigner functional is factorized into a physical
part and other one containing the constraints only. Some effects of non-trivial
topology within deformation quantization formalism are also considered.
