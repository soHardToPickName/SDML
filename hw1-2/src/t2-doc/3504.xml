On the Vortex-Point Charge Composite: Classical Orbits and Quantum Bound
  States
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of composite systems arising out of a point charge
interacting with a Nielsen-Olesen vortex in 2+1-dimensions is investigated. It
is shown that classical bounded orbits are possible for certain ranges of
parameters. Long lived metastable states are shown to exist, in a
semi-classical approach, from the study of the effective potential. Loss of
self-adjointness of the Hamiltonian and its subsequent self-adjoint extension
in some cases leads to bound states.
