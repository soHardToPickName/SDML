Bosonization in d=2 from finite chiral determinants with a Gauss
  decomposition
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to bosonize two-dimensional non-abelian models using finite
chiral determinants calculated from a Gauss decomposition. The calculation is
quite straightforward and hardly more involved than for the abelian case. In
particular, the counterterm $A\bar A$, which is normally motivated from gauge
invariance and then added by hand, appears naturally in this approach.
