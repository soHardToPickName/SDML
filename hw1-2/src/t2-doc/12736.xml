Mirror Symmetry as a Gauge Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that in string theory mirror duality is a gauge symmetry (a Weyl
transformation) in the moduli space of $N=2$ backgrounds on group manifolds,
and we conjecture on the possible generalization to other backgrounds, such as
Calabi-Yau manifolds.
