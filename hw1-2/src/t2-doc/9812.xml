The Loop Representation in Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the application of the loop representation to gauge theories and
general relativity. The emphasis lies on exhibiting the loop calculus
techniques, and their application to the canonical quantization. We discuss the
role that knot theory and loop coordinates play in the determination of
nondegenerate quantum states of the gravitational field.
