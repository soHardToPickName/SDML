On the Uniqueness of the effective Lagrangian for N= 2 SQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The low energy effective Lagrangian for N= 2 SU(2) supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory coupled to N_F<4 massless matter fields is derived from the BPS mass
formula using asymptotic freedom and assuming that the number of strong
coupling singularities is finite.
