The Calogero Model and the Virasoro Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new realizations of the Virasoro algebra inspired by the
Calogero model. The Virasoro algebra we find acts as a kind of
spectrum-generating algebra of the Calogero model. We furthermore present the
superextension of these results and introduce a class of higher-spin extensions
of the Virasoro algebra which are of the $W_\infty$ - type.
