Instantons in non-Cartesian coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  The explicit multi-instanton solutions by 'tHooft and Jackiw, Nohl & Rebbi
are generalized to curvilinear coordinates. The idea is that a gauge
transformation can notably simplify the expressions obtained after the change
of variables. The gauge transform generates a compensating addition to the
gauge potential of pseudoparticles. Singularities of the compensating field are
irrelevant for physics but may affect gauge dependent quantities.
