Instability of breathers in the topological discrete sine-Gordon system
</title>

<abstract>
  It is demonstrated that the breather solutions recently discovered in the
weakly coupled topological discrete sine-Gordon system are spectrally unstable.
This is in contrast with more conventional spatially discrete systems, whose
breathers are always spectrally stable at sufficiently weak coupling.
