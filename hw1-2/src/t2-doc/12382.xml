Constrained Dynamical Systems: Separation of Constraints into First and
  Second Classes
</title>

<abstract>
  In the Dirac approach to the generalized Hamiltonian formalism, dynamical
systems with first- and second-class constraints are investigated. The
classification and separation of constraints into the first- and second-class
ones are presented with the help of passing to an equivalent canonical set of
constraints. The general structure of second-class constraints is clarified.
