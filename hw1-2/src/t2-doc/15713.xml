Holography and Noncommutative Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note a lately proposed gravity dual of noncommutative Yang-Mills
theory is derived from the relations, recently suggested by Seiberg and Witten,
between closed string moduli and open string moduli. The only new input one
needs is a simple form of the running string tension as a function of energy.
This derivation provides convincing evidence that string theory integrates with
the holographical principle, and demonstrates a direct link between
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory and holography.
