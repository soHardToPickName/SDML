S-brane Solutions in Supergravity Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper time dependent solutions of supergravities with dilaton and
arbitrary rank antisymmetric tensor field are found. Although the solutions are
nonsupersymmetric the equations of motions can be integrated in a simple form.
Such supergravity solutions are related to Euclidean or spacelike branes
(S-branes).
