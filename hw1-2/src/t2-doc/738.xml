On Vector Bundles and Chiral Matter in N=1 Heterotic Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we derive the net number of generations of chiral fermions in
heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds with certain SU(n)
vector bundles, for n odd, using the parabolic approach for bundles. We compare
our results with the spectral cover construction for bundles and make a comment
on the net number interpretation in F-theory.
