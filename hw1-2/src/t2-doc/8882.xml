Tachyon Condensation and Background Independent Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study quantum corrections at the one loop level in open superstring
tachyon condensation using the boundary string field theory (BSFT) method. We
find that the tachyon field action has the same form as at the disc level, but
with a renormalized effective coupling $\lambda' =g_s^{ren}e^{-T^2/4}$
($g_s^{ren}$ is the renormalized dimensionless closed string coupling,
$e^{-T^2/4}$ is the tachyonic field expectation value) and with an effective
string tension. This result is in agreement with that based on general analysis
of loop effects.
