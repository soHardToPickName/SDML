The anticommutator spin algebra, its representations and quantum group
  invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a 3-generator algebra obtained by replacing the commutators by
anticommutators in the defining relations of the angular momentum algebra. We
show that integer spin representations are in one to one correspondence with
those of the angular momentum algebra. The half-integer spin representations,
on the other hand, split into two representations of dimension j + 1/2. The
anticommutator spin algebra is invariant under the action of the quantum group
SO_q(3) with q=-1.
