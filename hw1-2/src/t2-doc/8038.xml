String Quantum Symmetries and the SL(2,Z) Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove, using arguments relying only on the "special K\"ahler" structure of
the moduli space of the Calabi-Yau three-fold, that in the case of one single
modulus the quantum modular group of the string effective action corresponding
to Calabi-Yau vacua can not be SL(2,${Z\kern -4.6pt Z}$).
