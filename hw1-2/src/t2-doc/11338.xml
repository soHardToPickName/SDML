A simple remark on three dimensional gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical three dimensional Yang-Mills is seen to be related to the
topological Chern-Simons term through a nonlinear but fully local and covariant
gauge field redefinition. A classical recursive cohomological argument is
provided.
