Algebraic Aspects of Orbifold Models
</title>

<abstract>
  : Algebraic properties of orbifold models on arbitrary Riemann surfaces are
investigated. The action of mapping class group transformations and of standard
geometric operations is given explicitly. An infinite dimensional extension of
the quantum group is presented.
