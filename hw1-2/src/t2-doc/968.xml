Integers in the open string
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the $Y_{ab}^c$ of Pradisi-Sagnotti-Stanev are indeed integers,
and we prove a conjecture of Borisov-Halpern-Schweigert. We indicate some of
the special features which arise when the order of the modular matrix T is odd.
Our arguments are general, applying to arbitrary ``parent'' RCFT assuming only
that T has odd order.
