Evaluation of the Free Energy of Two-Dimensional Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The free energy in the weak-coupling phase of two-dimensional Yang-Mills
theory on a sphere for SO(N) and Sp(N) is evaluated in the 1/N expansion using
the techniques of Gross and Matytsin. Many features of Yang-Mills theory are
universal among different gauge groups in the large N limit, but significant
differences arise in subleading order in 1/N.
