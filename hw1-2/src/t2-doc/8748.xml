Localized Solutions in a 2 Dimensional Landau-Lifshitz Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the existence of stable time dependent solutions of the
Landau-Lifshitz model with a constant external magnetic field. We find such
solutions in all topological sectors, including N=0. We discuss some of their
properties.
