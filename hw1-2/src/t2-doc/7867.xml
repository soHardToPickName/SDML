Lorentz Anomaly and 1+1-Dimensional Radiating Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The radiation from the black holes of a 1+1-dimensional chiral quantum
gravity model is studied. Most notably, a non-trivial dependence on a
renormalization parameter that characterizes the anomaly relations is uncovered
in an improved semiclassical approximation scheme; this dependence is not
present in the naive semiclassical approximation.
