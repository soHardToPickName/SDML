The solution of a chiral random matrix model with complex eigenvalues
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe in detail the solution of the extension of the chiral Gaussian
Unitary Ensemble (chGUE) into the complex plane. The correlation functions of
the model are first calculated for a finite number of N complex eigenvalues,
where we exploit the existence of orthogonal Laguerre polynomials in the
complex plane. When taking the large-N limit we derive new correlation
functions in the case of weak and strong non-Hermiticity, thus describing the
transition from the chGUE to a generalized Ginibre ensemble. Applications to
the Dirac operator eigenvalue spectrum in QCD with non-vanishing chemical
potential are briefly discussed. This is an extended version of
arXiv:hep-th/0204068.
