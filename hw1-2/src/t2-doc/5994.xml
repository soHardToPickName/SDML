Generation of a dipole moment by external field in Born-Infeld
  non-linear electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The mechanism for the generation of a dipole moment due to an external field
is presented for the Born-Infeld charged particle. The 'polarizability
coefficient' is calculated: it is proportional to the third power of the
characteristic length in the Born-Infeld theory. Some physical implications are
briefly discussed.
