On the Minimal Model of Anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new geometric formulations for the fractional spin particle models
on the minimal phase spaces. New consistent couplings of the anyon to
background fields are constructed. The relationship between our approach and
previously developed anyon models is discussed.
