Curvature expansion for the background-induced gluodynamics string
</title>

<abstract>
  Using cumulant expansion for an averaged Wilson loop we derive an action of
the gluodynamics string in the form of a series in powers of the correlation
length of the vacuum. In the lowest orders it contains the Nambu-Goto term and
the rigidity term with the coupling constants computed from the bilocal
correlator of gluonic fields. Some higher derivative corrections are
calculated.
