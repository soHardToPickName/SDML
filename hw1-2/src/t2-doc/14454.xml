Black Hole Entropy from Conformal Field Theory in Any Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  Restricted to a black hole horizon, the ``gauge'' algebra of surface
deformations in general relativity contains a Virasoro subalgebra with a
calculable central charge. The fields in any quantum theory of gravity must
transform accordingly, i.e., they must admit a conformal field theory
description. Applying Cardy's formula for the asymptotic density of states, I
use this result to derive the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This method is
universal---it holds for any black hole, and requires no details of quantum
gravity---but it is also explicitly statistical mechanical, based on counting
microscopic states.
