Linear Stability of Dilatonic Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk, we recall the most important features of the Dilatonic Black
Holes which arise in the framework of the Einstein-Dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet theory
and which are dressed with a classical long range dilaton field in
contradiction with the existing "no-hair" theorems of the Theory of General
Relativity. We demonstrate linear stability of these black hole solutions under
small spacetime-dependent perturbations by making use of a semi-analytic method
based on the Fubini-Sturm's theorem. As a result, the Dilatonic Black Holes
constitute one of the very few examples of stable black hole solutions with
non-trivial "hair" that arise in the framework of a more generalised theory of
gravity.
