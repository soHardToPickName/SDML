N=2 Supersymmetric Calabi-Yau Hypersurface Sigma-Models on Curved
  Two-Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the effect of curved two-dimensional space-time on Witten's $N=2$
supersymmetric sigma models interpolating Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces to
Landau-Ginzburg models. In order for the former models to have significant
connection to superstring theory, only the $N=(1,1)$ or $N=(1,0)$ part of the
total $N=(2,2)$ world-sheet supersymmetry is made local. Even though there
arises an additional minimizing condition due to a scalar auxiliary field in
the supergravity multiplet on curved two-dimensions, the essential feature of
the sigma-model relating Calabi-Yau and Landau-Ginzburg models will be
maintained. This indicates the validity of these sigma models formulated on
curved two-dimensions or curved world-sheets. As a by-product, the coupling of
$N=(2,2)$ vector multiplets to other multiplets with $N=(1,1)$ local
supersymmetry is developed.
