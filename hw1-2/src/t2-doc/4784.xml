Enhanced gauge symmetries on elliptic K3
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the geometry of K3 surfaces with singularities of type A-D-E
contains enough information to reconstruct a copy of the Lie algebra associated
to the given Dynkin diagram. We apply this construction to explain the
enhancement of symmetry in F and IIA theories compactified on singular K3's.
