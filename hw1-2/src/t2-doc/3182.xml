Linking observables in perturbed topological field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The topological antisymmetric tensor field theory in n-dimensions is
perturbed by the introduction of local metric dependent interaction terms in
the curvatures. The correlator describing the linking number between two
surfaces in n-dimensions is shown to be not affected by the quantum
corrections.
