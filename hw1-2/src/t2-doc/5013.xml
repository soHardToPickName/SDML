Coleman-Weinberg Mechanism and Interaction of D3-Branes in Type 0 String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The low-energy theory on the world volume of parallel static D3-branes of
type 0 strings is the Yang-Mills theory with six scalar fields in the adjoint
representation. One-loop corrections in this theory induce Coleman-Weinberg
effective potential, which can be interpreted as an interaction energy of
D3-branes. The potential is repulsive at short distances and attractive at
large ones. In the equilibrium, a large number of D3-branes forms a spherical
shell with the radius proportional to the characteristic energy scale of the
world-volume theory.
