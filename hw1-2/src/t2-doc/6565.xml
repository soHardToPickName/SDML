The Kowalewski top in the SUSY quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The Kowalewski top on Lie algebras $o(4)$, $e(3)$ and $o(3,1)$ is embedded in
the SUSY quantum mechanics. In two dimensions we give the new prescription for
construction of the pairs of integrable systems by using a standard SUSY
algebra. At the proposed scheme the Goryachev-Chapligin top is shown to be a
natural partner of the Kowalewski top.
