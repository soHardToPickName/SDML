Consistency of Quantum Background Independence
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse higher order background independence conditions arising from
multiple commutators of background deformations in quantum closed string field
theory. The conditions are shown to amount to a vanishing theorem for
$\Delta_S$ cohomology classes. This holds by virtue of the existence of moduli
spaces of higher genus surfaces with two kinds of punctures. Our result is a
generalisation of a previous genus zero analysis relevant to the classical
theory.
