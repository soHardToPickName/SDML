Supersymmetry, G-flux and Spin(7) manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we study warped compactifications of M-theory on manifolds of
Spin(7) holonomy in the presence of background 4-form flux. The explicit form
of the superpotential can be given in terms of the self -dual Cayley
calibration on the Spin(7) manifold, in agreement with the general formula
propsed in hep-th/9911011.
