A Solvable Model of Two-Dimensional Dilaton-Gravity Coupled to a
  Massless Scalar Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a solvable model of two-dimensional dilaton-gravity coupled to a
massless scalar field. We locally integrate the field equations and briefly
discuss the properties of the solutions. For a particular choice of the
coupling between the dilaton and the scalar field the model can be interpreted
as the two-dimensional effective theory of 2+1 cylindrical gravity minimally
coupled to a massless scalar field.
