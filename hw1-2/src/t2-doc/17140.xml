Black holes in the lab?
</title>

<abstract>
  If TeV-scale gravity describes nature, black holes will be produced in
particle accelerators, perhaps even with impressive rates at the Large Hadron
Collider. Their decays, largely via the Hawking process, will be spectacular.
Black holes also would be produced in cosmic ray collisions with our
atmosphere, and their showers may be observable. Such a scenario means the end
of our quest to understand the world at shorter distances, but may represent
the beginning of the exploration of extra dimensions.
