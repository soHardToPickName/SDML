Integrable Mappings for Non--Commutative Objects
</title>

<abstract>
  The integrable mappings formalism is generalized on non--commutative case.
Arising hierarchies of integrable systems are invariant with respect to this
"quantum" discrete transformations without any assumption about commutative
properties of unknown operators they include. Partially, in the scope of this
construction are the equations for Heisenberg operators of quantum (integrable)
systems.
