<abstract>
  This article reports on a program to obtain and understand coherent states
for general systems. Most recently this has included supersymmetric systems. A
byproduct of this work has been studies of squeezed and supersqueezed states.
To obtain a physical understanding of these systems has always been a primary
goal. In particular, in the work on supersymmetry an attempt to understand the
role of Grassmann numbers in quantum mechanics has been initiated.
