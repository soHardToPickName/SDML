Hilbert Schemes, Separated Variables, and D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We explain Sklyanin's separation of variables in geometrical terms and
construct it for Hitchin and Mukai integrable systems. We construct Hilbert
schemes of points on $T^{*}\Sigma$ for $\Sigma = {\IC}, {\IC}^{*}$ or elliptic
curve, and on ${\bf C}^{2}/{\Gamma}$ and show that their complex deformations
are integrable systems of Calogero-Sutherland-Moser type. We present the
hyperk\"ahler quotient constructions for Hilbert schemes of points on cotangent
bundles to the higher genus curves, utilizing the results of Hurtubise,
Kronheimer and Nakajima. Finally we discuss the connections to physics of
$D$-branes and string duality.
