Brane-World Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational collapse of matter trapped on a brane will produce a black hole
on the brane. We discuss such black holes in the models of Randall and Sundrum
where our universe is viewed as a domain wall in five dimensional anti-de
Sitter space. We present evidence that a non-rotating uncharged black hole on
the domain wall is described by a ``black cigar'' solution in five dimensions.
