Cutting rules and perturbative unitarity of noncommutative electric-type
  field theories from string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the breakdown of perturbative unitarity of noncommutative quantum
field theories in electric-type background in the light of string theory. We
consider the analytic structure of string loop two-point functions using a
suitable off-shell continuation and then study the zero slope limit of Seiberg
and Witten. In this way we pick up how the unphysical tachyonic branch cut
appears in the noncommutative field theory. We briefly discuss discontinuities
and cutting rules for the full string theory amplitude and relate them to the
noncommutative field theoretical results, and also discuss the insight one
gains into the magnetic case too.
