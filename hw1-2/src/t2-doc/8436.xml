</title>

<abstract>
  Within the Electric Schroedinger Representation of the Yang-Mills theory the
Hamiltonian eigenstate and eigenvalue, as well as the Coulomb and confining
potentials are presented for a special regularization-approximation scheme,
which focuses on the ultra-local behavior of the propagator.
