On the Dirac Quantization of two Dimensional Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Dirac quantization of two dimensional gravity with bosonic
matter fields. After defining the extended Hamiltonian it is possible to fix
the gauge completely. The commutators can all be obtained in closed form;
nevertheless, the results are not particularly simple.
