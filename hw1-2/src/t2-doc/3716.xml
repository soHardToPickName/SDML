Massive Spectral Sum Rules for the Dirac Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  Massive spectral sum rules are derived for Dirac operators of $SU(N_c)$ gauge
theories with $N_f$ flavors. The universal microscopic massive spectral
densities of random matrix theory, where known, are all consistent with these
sum rules.
