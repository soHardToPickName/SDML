Black Hole Thermodynamics from the point of view of Superstring Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this review we try to give a pedagogical introduction to the recent
progress in the resolution of old problems of black hole thermodynamics within
superstring theory. We start with a brief description of classical black hole
dynamics. Then, follow with the consideration of general properties of
supersymmetric black holes. We conclude with the review of the statistical
explanation of the black hole entropy and string theory description of the
black hole evaporation.
