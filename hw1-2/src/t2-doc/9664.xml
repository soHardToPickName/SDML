Perturbation Theory in Angular Quantization Approach and the Expectation
  Values of Exponential Fields in Sin-Gordon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In angular quantization approach a perturbation theory for the Massive
Thirring Model (MTM) is developed, which allows us to calculate Vacuum
Expectation Values of exponential fields in sin-Gordon theory near the free
fermion point in first order of MTM coupling constant $g$. The
Hankel-transforms play an important role when carrying out this calculations.
The expression we have found coincides with that of the direct expansion over
$g$ of the exact formula conjectured by S.Lukyanov and A.Zamolodchikov.
