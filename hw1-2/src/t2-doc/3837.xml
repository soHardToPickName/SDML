Cayley-Klein contractions of orthosymplectic superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a class of orthosymplectic superalgebras $osp(m;j|2n;\omega)$ which
may be obtained from $osp(m|2n)$ by contractions and analytic continuations in
a similar way as the orthogonal and the symplectic Cayley-Klein algebras are
obtained from the corresponding classical ones. Contractions of $osp(1|2)$ and
$osp(3|2)$ are regarded as an examples.
