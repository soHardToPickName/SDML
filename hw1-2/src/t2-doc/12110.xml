The renormalized $\phi^4_4$-trajectory by perturbation theory in a
  running coupling using partial differential equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the renormalized trajectory of $\phi^4_4$-theory by perturbation
theory in a running coupling. We use an exact infinitesimal renormalization
group. The expansion is put into a form which is manifestly independent of the
scale parameter.
