The Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Algebras of Logarithmic Superconformal
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the general features of the Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond sectors of
logarithmic conformal field theories with N=1 supersymmetry. Three particular
systems are examined in some detail -- D-brane recoil, a superconformal
extension of the c=-2 model, and the supersymmetric SU(2)_2 WZW model.
