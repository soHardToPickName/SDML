Frustrating and Diluting Dynamical Lattice Ising Spins
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate what happens to the third order ferromagnetic phase transition
displayed by the Ising model on various dynamical planar lattices (ie coupled
to 2D quantum gravity) when we introduce annealed bond disorder in the form of
either antiferromagnetic couplings or null couplings. We also look at the
effect of such disordering for the Ising model on general $\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$
Feynman diagrams.
