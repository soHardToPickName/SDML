Membrany corrections to the string anti-string potential in M5-brane
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the potential between a string and an anti-string source in
M5-theory by using the adS/CFT duality conjecture. We find that the next to
leading order corrections in a saddle point approximation renormalize the
classical result.
