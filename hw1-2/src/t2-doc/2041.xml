Bell's inequality, the Pauli exclusion principle and baryonic structure
</title>

<abstract>
  Bell's inequality has been traditionally used to explore the relationship
between hidden variables and the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
mechanics. In this paper, another use is found. Bell's inequality is used to
derive a coupling principle for elementary particles and to give a deeper
understanding of baryonic structure. We also give a derivation of the Pauli
exclusion principle from the coupling principle. Pacs: 14.20-c, 12.90+b,
