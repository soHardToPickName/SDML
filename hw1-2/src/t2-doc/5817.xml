A Calibration Bound for the M-Theory Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a covariant bound on the energy-momentum of the M-fivebrane
which is saturated by all supersymmetric configurations. This leads to a
generalised notion of a calibrated geometry for M-fivebranes when the
worldvolume gauge field is non-zero. The generalisation relevant for Dp-branes
is also given.
