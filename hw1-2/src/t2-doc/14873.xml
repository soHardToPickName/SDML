Flow equation for Halpern-Huang directions of scalar O(N) models
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of asymptotically free scalar theories with O(N) symmetry, defined
via the eigenpotentials of the Gaussian fixed point (Halpern-Huang directions),
are investigated using renormalization group flow equations. Explicit solutions
for the form of the potential in the nonperturbative infrared domain are found
in the large-N limit. In this limit, potentials without symmetry breaking
essentially preserve their shape and undergo a mass renormalization which is
governed only by the renormalization group distance parameter; as a
consequence, these scalar theories do not have a problem of naturalness.
Symmetry-breaking potentials are found to be ``fine-tuned'' in the large-N
limit in the sense that the nontrivial minimum vanishes exactly in the limit of
vanishing infrared cutoff: therefore, the O(N) symmetry is restored in the
quantum theory and the potential becomes flat near the origin.
