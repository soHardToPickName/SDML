All the Exact Solutions of Generalized Calogero-Sutherland Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A collective field method is extended to obtain all the explicit solutions of
the generalized Calogero-Sutherland models that are characterized by the roots
of all the classical groups, including the solutions corresponding to spinor
representations for $B_N$ and $D_N$ cases.
