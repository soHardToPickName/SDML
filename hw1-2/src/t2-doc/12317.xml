The wave function of the universe and spontaneaus breaking of
  supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we define a scalar product ``weighted'' with the scalar factor
$R$ and show how to find a normalized wave function for the supersymmetric
quantum FRW cosmological model using the idea of supersymmetry breaking
selection rules under local n=2 conformal supersymmetry. We also calculate the
expectation value of the scalar factor R in this model and its corresponding
behaviour.
