N = 2 Gauge/Gravity Duals
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the N = 2 supersymmetric analog of the Klebanov-Strassler system. We
first review the resolution of singularities by the enhancon mechanism, and the
physics of fractional branes on an orbifold. We then describe the exact N = 2
solution. This exhibits a duality cascade as in the N = 1 case, but the
singularity resolution is the characteristic N = 2 enhancon. We discuss some
related solutions and open issues.
