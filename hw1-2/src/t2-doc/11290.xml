  This work is a continuation of paper (hep-th/9407146) where the Boltzmann
weights for the N-state integrable spin model on the cubic lattice has been
obtained only numerically. In this paper we present the analytical formulae for
this model in a particular case. Here the Boltzmann weights depend on six free
parameters including the elliptic modulus. The obtained solution allows to
construct a two-parametric family of the commuting two-layer transfer matrices.
Presented model is expected to be simpler for a further investigation in
comparison with a more general model mentioned above.
