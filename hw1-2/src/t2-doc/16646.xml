Closed Path Integrals and Renormalisation in Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a closed form expression for the path integral of quantum
transition amplitudes. We introduce a quantum action with renormalized
parameters. We present numerical results for the $V \sim x^{4}$ potential. The
renormalized action is relevant for quantum chaos and quantum instantons.
