Strong Coupling Qed Breaks Chiral Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the strong coupling limit of d-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics with $2^{d}/2^{[d/2]}$ flavors of fermions can be mapped onto
the s=1/2 quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet in d-1 space dimensions. The
staggered N\'eel order parameter is the expectation value of a mass operator in
QED and the spin-waves are pions. We speculate that the chiral symmetry
breaking phase transition corresponds to a transition between the flux phase
and the conventional N\'eel ordered phase of an antiferromagnetic t-J model.
