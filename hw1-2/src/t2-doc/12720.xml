A Heterotic N=2 String with Space-Time Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the issue of embedding space-time fermions into the
four-dimensional N=2 world-sheet supersymmetric string. A new heterotic theory
is constructed, taking the right-movers from the N=4 topological extension of
the conventional N=2 string but a c=0 conformal field theory supporting
target-space supersymmetry for the left-moving sector. The global bosonic
symmetry of the full formalism proves to be U(1,1), just as in the usual N=2
string. Quantization reveals a spectrum of only two physical states, one boson
and one fermion, which fall in a multiplet of (1,0) supersymmetry.
