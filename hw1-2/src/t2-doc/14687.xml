Perturbative Approach For Non Renormalizable Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Renormalization procedure is generalized to be applicable for non
renormalizable theories. It is shown that introduction of an extra expansion
parameter allows to get rid of divergences and express physical quantities as
series of finite number of interdependent expansion parameters. Suggested
method is applied to quantum (Einstein's) gravity.
