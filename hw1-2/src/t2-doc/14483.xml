Nonlocal regularization of abelian models with spontaneous symmetry
  breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate how nonlocal regularization is applied to gauge invariant
models with spontaneous symmetry breaking. Motivated by the ability to find a
nonlocal BRST invariance that leads to the decoupling of longitudinal gauge
bosons from physical amplitudes, we show that the original formulation of the
method leads to a nontrivial relationship between the nonlocal form factors
that can appear in the model.
