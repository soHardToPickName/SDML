Branes and integrability in the N=2 SUSY YM theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest the brane interpretation of the integrable dynamics behind the
exact solution to the N=2 SUSY YM theory. Degrees of freedom of the Calogero
type integrable system responsible for the appearance of the spectral Riemann
surfaces originate from the collective coordinates of the dynamical branes. The
second Whitham type integrable system corresponds to the low energy scattering
of branes similar to the scattering of the magnetic monopoles.
