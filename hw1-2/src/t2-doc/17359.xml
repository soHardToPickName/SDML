Baby universes in 2d quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the fractal structure of $2d$ quantum gravity, both for pure
gravity and for gravity coupled to multiple gaussian fields and for gravity
coupled to Ising spins. The roughness of the surfaces is described in terms of
baby universes and using numerical simulations we measure their distribution
which is related to the string susceptibility exponent $\g_{string}$.
