On the classification of (2,1) heterotic strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We classify all untwisted (2,1) heterotic strings. The only solutions are the
three already known cases, having massless spectra consisting either of 24
chiral fermions, or of 24 bosons, or of 8 scalars and 8 fermions of each
chirality.
