Duality Symmetries and the Type II String Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the duality symmetries of Type II string effective actions in
nine, ten and eleven dimensions. As a by-product we give a covariant action
underlying the ten--dimensional Type IIB supergravity theory. We apply duality
symmetries to construct dyonic Type II string solutions in six dimensions and
their reformulation as solutions of the ten--dimensional Type IIB theory in ten
dimensions.
