Decomposing the SU(N) Connection and the Wu-Yang Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the decomposition of SU(2) gauge field, we derive a generalization
of the decomposition theory for the SU(N) gauge field. We thus obtain the
invariant electro-magnetic tensors of SU(N) groups and the extended Wu-Yang
potentials. The sourceless solutions are also discussed.
