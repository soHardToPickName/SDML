The Holographic Dual of a SUSY Vector Model and Tensionless Open Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a supersymmetric example of the holographic duality between 3
dimensional vector models and higher spin gauge theories in AdS_4, first
proposed in a bosonic context by Klebanov and Polyakov. We argue that a
particular Fradkin-Vasiliev type supersymmetric higher spin gauge theory in
AdS_4 with 16 supersymmetries is dual to the singlet sector of bilinear
operators of a free N = 4, SU(N) vector model defined on the boundary. Starting
from the duality between type IIB on AdS_5 \times S^5 with a D5-brane as an
AdS_4 \times S^2 subspace and the 4 dimensional SU(N) SYM with a defect, we
recover the duality between our vector model and the higher spin gauge theory.
In this case, we propose that the higher spin gauge theory is a truncation of
the open string theory on the world volume of the D5-brane in its tensionless
string limit. We also comment on a possible Higgs mechanism in our model.
