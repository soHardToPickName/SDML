On the solution of the Calogero model and its generalization to the case
  of distinguishable particles
</title>

<abstract>
  The 3-body Calogero problem is solved by separation of variables for
arbitrary exchange statistics. A numerical computation of the 4-body spectrum
is also presented. The results display new features in comparison with the
standard case of bosons and fermions, for instance the energies are not linear
with the interaction parameter $\nu$ and Bethe ansatz as well as Haldane's
statistics are not verified.
