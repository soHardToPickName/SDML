QCD near the Light Cone
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the QCD Lagrangian, we present the QCD Hamiltonian for near
light cone coordinates. We study the dynamics of the gluonic zero modes of this
Hamiltonian. The strong coupling solutions serve as a basis for the complete
problem. We discuss the importance of zero modes for the confinement mechanism.
