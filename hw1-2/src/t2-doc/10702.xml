Entropy Bounds and String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  After discussing some old (and not-so-old) entropy bounds both for isolated
systems and in cosmology, I will argue in favour of a "Hubble entropy bound"
holding in the latter context. I will then apply this bound to recent
developments in string cosmology, show that it is naturally saturated
throughout pre-big bang inflation, and claim that its fulfilment at later times
has interesting implications for the exit problem of string cosmology.
