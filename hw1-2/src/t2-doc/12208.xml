A Mechanism for Charge Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze a potential that produces background charges which are
automatically quantized. This introduces a new mechanism for charge
quantization, although so far it has only been implemented for background
charges. We show that this same mechanism can also lead to an alternative means
of hiding extra dimensions that is analogous to the Kaluza-Klein approach.
