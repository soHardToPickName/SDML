Arbitrary spin massless bosonic fields in d-dimensional anti-de Sitter
  space
</title>

<abstract>
  Arbitrary spin free massless bosonic fields propagating in even $d$ -
dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. Free wave equations of
motion, subsidiary conditions and the corresponding gauge transformations for
such fields are proposed. The lowest eigenvalues of the energy operator for the
massless fields and the gauge parameter fields are derived. The results are
formulated in $SO(d-1,2)$ covariant form as well as in terms of intrinsic
coordinates. An inter-relation of two definitions of masslessness based on
gauge invariance and conformal invariance is discussed.
