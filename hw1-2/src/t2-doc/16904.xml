Mass Degeneracies In Self-Dual Models
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic restriction of the nonabelian self-dual Chern-Simons-Higgs
systems leads to coupled abelian models with interesting mass spectra. The
vacua are characterized by embeddings of $SU(2)$ into the gauge algebra, and in
the broken phases the gauge and real scalar masses coincide, reflecting the
relation of these self-dual models to $N=2$ SUSY. The masses themselves are
related to the exponents of the gauge algebra, and the self-duality equation is
a deformation of the classical Toda equations.
