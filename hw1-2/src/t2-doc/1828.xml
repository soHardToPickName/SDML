Instantons, Three-Dimensional Gauge Theory, and the Atiyah-Hitchin
  Manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate quantum effects on the Coulomb branch of three-dimensional N=4
supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group SU(2). We calculate perturbative
and one-instanton contributions to the Wilsonian effective action using
standard weak-coupling methods. Unlike the four-dimensional case, and despite
supersymmetry, the contribution of non-zero modes to the instanton measure does
not cancel. Our results allow us to fix the weak-coupling boundary conditions
for the differential equations which determine the hyper-Kahler metric on the
quantum moduli space. We confirm the proposal of Seiberg and Witten that the
Coulomb branch is equivalent, as a hyper-Kahler manifold, to the centered
moduli space of two BPS monopoles constructed by Atiyah and Hitchin.
