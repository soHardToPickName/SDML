From SYM Perturbation Theory to Closed Strings in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  For the purpose of better understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence it is
useful to have a description of the theory for all values of the 't Hooft
coupling, and for all $N$. We discuss such a description in the framework of
Matrix theory for SYM on D4-branes, which is given in terms of quantum
mechanics on the moduli space of solutions of the Nahm equations. This
description reduces to both SYM perturbation theory and to closed string
perturbation theory, each in its appropriate regime of validity, suggesting a
way of directly relating the variables in the two descriptions. For example, it
shows explicitly how holes in the world-sheets of the 't Hooft expansion close
to give closed surfaces.
