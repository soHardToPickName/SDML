Possible Implications of the Quantum Theory of Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the implications of some simple assumptions about the nature of
the quantum theory of gravity which are plausible for a class of possible
theories I have been attempting to construct. The simple assumptions turn out
to have surprizingly wide implications of a type one might call philosophical.
The paper is short and nontechnical. ( This builds on recent unpublished work
of Lee Smolin, but comes to opposite conclusions).
