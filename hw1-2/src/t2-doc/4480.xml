A determination of <A^2> and the non-perturbative vacuum energy of
  Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the 2-point-particle-irreducible (2PPI) expansion, which sums
bubble graphs to all orders, in the context of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in the
Landau gauge. Using the method we investigate the possible existence of a gluon
condensate of mass dimension two, <A^2>, and the corresponding non-zero vacuum
energy. This condensate gives rise to a dynamically generated mass for the
gluon.
