Geometry and Toplogy of Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Basic concepts and definitions in differential geometry and topology which
are important in the theory of solitons and instantons are reviewed. Many
examples from soliton theory are discussed briefly, in order to highlight the
application of various geometrical concepts and techniques.
