The radion in brane cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the homogeneous cosmological radion, which we define as the
interbrane distance in a two brane and $Z_2$ symmetrical configuration. In a
coordinate system where one of the brane is at rest, the junction conditions
for the second (moving) brane give directly the (non-linear) equations of
motion for the radion. We analyse the radion fluctuations and solve the
non-linear dynamics in some simple cases of interest.
