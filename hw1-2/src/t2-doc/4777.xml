Tachyon Condensation on Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss noncommutative solitons on a noncommutative torus and their
application to tachyon condensation. In the large B limit, they can be exactly
described by the Powers-Rieffel projection operators known in the mathematical
literature. The resulting soliton spectrum is consistent with T-duality and is
surprisingly interesting. It is shown that an instability arises for any
D-branes, leading to the decay into many smaller D-branes. This phenomenon is
the consequence of the fact that K-homology for type II von Neumann factor is
labeled by R.
