Finite Energy Electroweak Dyon
</title>

<abstract>
  We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size is
fixed by the electroweak scale. We discuss two types of solutions. The first
type is obtained by regularizing the recent solutions of Cho and Maison by
modifying the coupling strength of the quartic self-interaction of $W$-boson in
Weinberg-Salam model. The second is obtained by enlarging the gauge group
$SU(2) \times U(1)$ to $SU(2) \times SU(2)$. Our result demonstrates that
genuine electroweak monopole and dyon could exist whose mass scale is much
smaller than the grand unification scale.
