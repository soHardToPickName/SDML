Gauging of Lorentz Group WZW Model by its Null Subgroup
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the standard vector gauging of Lorentz group $ SO(3,1) $ WZW
model by its non-semisimple null Euclidean subgroup in two dimensions $ E(2) $.
The resultant effective action of the theory is seen to describe a one
dimensional bosonic field in the presence of external charge that we interpret
it as a Liouville field. Gauging a boosted $ SO(3) $ subgroup, we find that in
the limit of the large boost, the theory can be interpreted as an interacting
Toda theory. We also take the generalized non-standard bilinear form for
$SO(3,1) $ and gauge both $ SO(3) $ and $E(2)$ subgroups and discuss the
resultant theories.
