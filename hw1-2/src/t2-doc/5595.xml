WDVV Equations as Functional Relations
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the associativity or WDVV equations and demonstrate that they can
be rewritten as certain functional relations between the {\it second}
derivatives of a single function, similar to the dispersionless Hirota
equations. The properties of these functional relations are further discussed.
