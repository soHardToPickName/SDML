Quantum Gravity: A Mathematical Physics Perspective
</title>

<abstract>
  This article is based on an invited talk given at the Workshop on
Mathematical Physics Towards XXIst Century, held at Beer-Sheva, Israel in 1993.
It contains an introduction to quantum gravity for mathematical physicists with
an emphasis on the difference between the structure of this theory from more
familiar, Minkowskian quantum field theories which arise due to the absence of
a background space-time geometry.
