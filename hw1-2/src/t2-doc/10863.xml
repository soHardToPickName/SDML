Exact Renormalized One-Loop Quantum Corrections to Energies of Solitonic
  Field Configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method for computing exact one-loop quantum corrections to the
energies of static classical backgrounds in renormalizable quantum field
theories. We use a continuum density of states formalism to construct a
regularized Casimir energy in terms of phase shifts and their Born
approximations. This method unambiguously incorporates definite counterterms
fixed in the standard way by physical renormalization conditions. The result is
a robust computation that can be efficiently implemented both numerically and
analytically. We carry out such calculations in models of bosons and fermions
in one and three dimensions.
