On the high derivative fermionic operator and trace anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a new example of the high derivative four-dimensional conformal
operator. This operator acts on fermions, and its contribution to the trace
anomaly has opposite sign, as compared to conventional scalars, spinors and
vectors. Possible generalizations and applications are discussed.
