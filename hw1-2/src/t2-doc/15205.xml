A Century of Gravity: 1901--2000 (plus some 2001)
</title>

<abstract>
  This lecture consists of two parts. The first is a (totally unsystematic)
survey of some of the high points in the evolution of gravity and its
successors, primarily in the course of the past century. The second summarizes
some new work on surprising properties of higher $(> 1)$ spin fields in
cosmological backgrounds: the presence of $\L$ gives rise to discrete sets of
massive models endowed with gauge invariances, that divide the ($m^2, \L$)
plane into unitary and non-unitary phases. The unitary region common to
fermions and bosons shrinks to flat space ($ \L \to 0 $) as their spins
increase.
