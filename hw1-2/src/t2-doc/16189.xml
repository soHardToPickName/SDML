Effective Potential for the Conformal Sector of Quantum Gravity with
  Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective potential which describes the conformal dynamics of quantum
gravity with torsion is discussed. The phase transitions induced by the
combination of torsion and curvature are investigated. The mechanism for fixing
the vacuum expectation values of the metric and torsion is presented.
