An algebraic approach to logarithmic conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A comprehensive introduction to logarithmic conformal field theory, using an
algebraic point of view, is given. A number of examples are explained in
detail, including the c=-2 triplet theory and the k=-4/3 affine su(2) theory.
We also give some brief introduction to the work of Zhu.
