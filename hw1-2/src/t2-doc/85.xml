Dial M for Flavor Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a realization of Seiberg duality in MQCD that does not involve
moving branes. Using related arguments in M Theory and IIA, we investigate the
flavor symmetry breaking via flavored magnetic monopole condensation of
hep-th/0005076. We verify our results by considering visualizations of M5
branes corresponding to $\N=2$ vacua which survive soft breaking by an adjoint
mass term.
