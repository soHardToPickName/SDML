Conformality, Particle Phenomenology and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Conformality is the idea that at TeV scales enrichment of the standard model
particle spectrum leads to conformal invariance at a fixed point of the
renormalization group. Some aspects of conformality in particle phenomenology
and cosmology are discussed.
