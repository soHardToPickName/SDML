Spontaneous Violation of Lorentz Invariance and Ultra-High Energy Cosmic
  Rays
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that local Lorentz invariance is spontaneously violated at high
energies, due to a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value of a vector field
\phi^\mu, as a possible explanation of the observation of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays with an energy above the GZK cutoff. Certain consequences of
spontaneous breaking of Lorentz invariance in cosmology are discussed.
