A Map between q-deformed and ordinary Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In complete analogy with Seiberg-Witten map defined in noncommutative
geometry we introduce a new map between a q-deformed gauge theory and an
ordinary gauge theory. The construction of this map is elaborated in order to
fit the Hopf algebra structure.
