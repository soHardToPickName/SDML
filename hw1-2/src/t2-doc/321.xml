Threshold effects in open-string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the one-loop effective gauge-field action in $Z_2$-orbifold
compactifications of type-I theory. We show how, for non-abelian group factors,
the threshold effects are ultraviolet finite though given entirely by a
six-dimensional field theory expression.
