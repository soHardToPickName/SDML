Algebraic treatment of compactification on noncommutative tori
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the compactification conditions of the M theory on
D-dimensional noncommutative tori. The main tool used for this analysis is the
algebra A(Z^D) of the projective representations of the abelian group Z^D. We
exhibit the explicit solutions in the space of the multiplication algebra of
A(Z^D), that is the algebra generated by right and left multiplications.
