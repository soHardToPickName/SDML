"Renormalization" Of Non Renormalizable Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A perturbative approach for non renormalizable theories is developed. It is
shown that the introduction of an extra expansion parameter allows one to get
rid of divergences and express physical quantities as series with finite
coefficients. The method is demonstrated on the example of massive non abelian
field coupled to a fermion field.
