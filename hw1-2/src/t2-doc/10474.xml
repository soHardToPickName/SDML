Sectors of Mutually Local Fields in Integrable Models of Quantum Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known that 2D field theories admit several sectors of mutually local
fields so as two fields from different sectors are mutually nonlocal. We show
that any one-partical integrable model with ${\bf Z}_2$ symmetry contains three
sectors: bosonic, fermionic and `disorder' one. We generalize the form factor
axioms to fermionic and `disorder' sectors. For the particular case of the
sinh-Gordon model we obtain several form factors in these sectors.
