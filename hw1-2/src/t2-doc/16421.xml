Some Results on (0,2) Z_N Orbifold Theories with Continuous Wilson Lines
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss recent results on orbifold compactifications with (0,2) world
sheet supersymmetry and continuous Wilson lines, emphasizing the role of
modular symmetries. (This work is a contribution to the proceedings of the
joint US Polish Workshop on Physics from the Planck scale to the Electro-Weak
scale, Warsaw, 21.9. - 24.9.1994)
