Symmetry in the Topological Phase of String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  I present arguments to the affect that the topological phase of string theory
must be event-symmetric. This motivates a search for a universal string group
for discrete strings in event-symmetric space-time which unifies space-time
symmetry with internal gauge symmetry. This is partially successful but the
results are incomplete and I speculate on the use of quantum groups to define a
well behaved theory which would resolve the discrete/continuum dual nature of
stringy space-time.
