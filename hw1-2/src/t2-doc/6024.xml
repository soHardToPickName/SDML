D1D5 systems and AdS/CFT correspondences with 16 supercharges
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the spectra of BPS excitations of D1D5 bound states in a class of
free orbifolds/orientifolds of type IIB theory and its dual descriptions in
terms of chiral primaries of the corresponding $AdS_3$ supergravities.
