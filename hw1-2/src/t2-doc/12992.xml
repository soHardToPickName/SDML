Born-Infeld Action and Chern-Simons Term from Kaluza-Klein Monopole in
  M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the zero modes of the Kaluza-Klein monopole in M-theory and
show that the Born-Infeld action and the Chern-Simons term of a D6-brane are
reproduced to quadratic order in the field strength of the U(1) field on the
brane.
