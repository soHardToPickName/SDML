Current Directions in String Theory and Abstract Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss some current thoughts on how low-energy measurements and
consistency constrain theories at high energies with emphasis on string theory.
I also discuss some recent work on the dynamics of supersymmetric gauge
theories.
