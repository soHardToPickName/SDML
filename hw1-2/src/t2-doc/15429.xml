Motivations and Physical Aims of Algebraic QFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We present illustrations which show the usefulness of algebraic QFT. In
particular in low-dimensional QFT, when Lagrangian quantization does not exist
or is useless (e.g. in chiral conformal theories), the algebraic method is
beginning to reveal its strength.
