Entropy of Schwarzschild black hole and string-black hole correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  The string-black hole correspondence is considered in the context of the
correspondence principle proposed recently by Horowitz and Polchinski. We
demonstrate that the entropy of string states and the entropy of a
Schwarzschild black hole can be matched including the subleading terms which
depend on mass logarithmically. We argue the necessity to include the string
interaction (with coupling $g$) in the consideration and propose the
$g^2$-dependent modification of the string entropy. The matching of it with the
entropy of Schwarzschild black hole is analyzed.
