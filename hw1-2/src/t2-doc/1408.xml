Integrable XYZ Model with Staggered Anisotropy Parameter
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply to the XYZ model the technique of construction of integrable models
with staggered parameters, presented recently for the XXZ case. The solution of
modified Yang-Baxter equations is found and the corresponding integrable
zig-zag ladder Hamiltonian is calculated. The result is coinciding with the XXZ
case in the appropriate limit.
