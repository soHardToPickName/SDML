How to Find H-Monopoles in Brane Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove in two different ways that brane dynamics gives rise to all
H-monopoles predicted by S-duality of N=4, 4-dimensional superstring
compactifications. One method uses heterotic-type II duality and the self-dual
3-brane dynamics, the other uses the 5-brane description of small instantons in
SO(32) superstrings.
