Inflation in String Theory and how you can get out of it
</title>

<abstract>
  Inflation is now a basic ingredient of the modern cosmology. After reviewing
the basic characteristics of inflation, we briefly discuss inflation in string
and brane theories, focusing on the problem of the exit from inflation in these
theories. We present a model, based on type-0 string theory, in which our
universe after the inflationary phase, passes smoothly to a flat
Robertson-Walker universe.
