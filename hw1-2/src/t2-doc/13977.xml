Explicit construction of constrained instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  Instantons in massless theories do not carry over to massive theories due to
Derrick's theorem. This theorem can, however, be circumvented, if a constraint
that restricts the scale of the instanton is imposed on the theory. Constrained
instantons are considered in four dimensions in phi^4 theory and SU(2)
Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. In each of these theories a calculational sceme is set
up and solved in the lowest few orders in the mass parameter in such a way that
the need for a constraint is exhibited clearly. Constrained instantons are
shown to exist as finite action solutions of the field equations with
exponential fall off only for specific constraints that are unique in lowest
order in the mass parameter in question.
