Stability of bound states in the light-front Yukawa model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in the system of two fermions interacting by scalar exchange,
the solutions for J$^{\pi}$=$0^+$ bound states are stable without any cutoff
regularization, for values of the coupling constant $\alpha$ below a critical
value $\alpha_c$. This latter is calculated from an eigenvalue equation.
