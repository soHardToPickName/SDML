Exact Embedding of N=1, D=7 Gauged Supergravity in D=11
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the explicit and complete bosonic non-linear Kaluza-Klein ansatz
for the consistent S^4 reduction of D=11 supergravity to N=1, D=7 gauged
supergravity. This provides a geometrical interpretation of the lower
dimensional solutions from the eleven-dimensional point of view.
