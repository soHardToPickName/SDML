Noncommutative Gauge Theories in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general framework for Matrix theory compactified on a quotient
space R^n/G, with G a discrete group of Euclidean motions in R^n. The general
solution to the quotient conditions gives a gauge theory on a noncommutative
space. We characterize the resulting noncommutative gauge theory in terms of
the twisted group algebra of G associated with a projective regular
representation. Also we show how to extend our treatments to incorporate
orientifolds.
