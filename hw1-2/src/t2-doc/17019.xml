Pair Production by a Constant External Field in Noncommutative QED
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study QED on the noncommutative space in the constant
electro-magnetic field background. Using the explicit solutions of the
noncommutative version of Dirac equation in such background, we show that there
are well-defined in and out -going asymptotic states and also there is a causal
Green's function. We calculate the pair production rate in this case. We show
that at tree level noncommutativity will not change the pair production and the
threshold electric field. We also calculate the pair production rate
considering the first loop corrections. In this case we show that the threshold
electric field is decreased by the noncommutativity effects.
