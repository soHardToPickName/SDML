Higher bundle gerbes and cohomology classes in gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The notion of a higher bundle gerbe is introduced to give a geometric
realization of the higher degree integral cohomology of certain manifolds. We
consider examples using the infinite dimensional spaces arising in gauge
theories.
