Propagators and Path Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  Path-integral expressions for one-particle propagators in scalar and
fermionic field theories are derived, for arbitrary mass. This establishes a
direct connection between field theory and specific classical point-particle
models. The role of world-line reparametrization invariance of the classical
action and the implementation of the corresponding BRST-symmetry in the quantum
theory are discussed. The presence of classical world-line supersymmetry is
shown to lead to an unwanted doubling of states for massive spin-1/2 particles.
The origin of this phenomenon is traced to a `hidden' topological fermionic
excitation. A different formulation of the pseudo-classical mechanics using a
bosonic representation of $\gam_5$ is shown to remove these extra states at the
expense of losing manifest supersymmetry.
