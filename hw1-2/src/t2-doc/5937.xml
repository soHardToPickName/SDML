Exact Solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt Equation of Two Dimensional
  Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The two dimensional dilaton gravity with the cosmological term and with an
even number of matter fields minimally coupled to the gravity is considered.
The exact solutions to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation are obtained in an explicit
functional form, which contain an arbitrary holomorphic function of the matter
fields.
