The fine structure constant at the unification scale equal to 1/4pi?
</title>

<abstract>
  A recently proposed topological mechanism for the quantization of the charge
gives the value e_0=\sqrt{\hbar c} for both the fundamental electric and
magnetic charges. It is argued that the corresponding fine structure constant
\alpha_0=1/4pi could be interpreted as its value at the unification scale.
