Vertex operators, semiclassical limit for soliton S-matrices and the
  number of bound states in Affine Toda Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Soliton time-delays and the semiclassical limit for soliton S-matrices are
calculated for non-simply laced Affine Toda Field Theories. The phase shift is
written as a sum over bilinears on the soliton conserved charges. The results
apply to any two solitons of any Affine Toda Field Theory. As a by-product, a
general expression for the number of bound states and the values of the
coupling in which the S-matrix can be diagonal are obtained. In order to arrive
at these results, a vertex operator is constructed, in the principal gradation,
for non-simply laced affine Lie algebras, extending the previous constructions
for simply laced and twisted affine Lie algebras.
