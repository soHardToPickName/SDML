$SO(5)_{q}$ and Contraction
</title>

<abstract>
  Representations of $SO(5)_{q}$ are constructed explicitly on the Chevalley
basis for all $q$, generic and root of unity. Matrix elements of the generators
are obtained for all representations depending on three variable indices, the
maximal number being 4. A prescription for contraction is given such that a
complete Hopf algebra is immediately obtained for the non-semisimple contracted
case. For $q$ a root of unity the periodic representations for $SO(5)_{q}$ and
the contracted algebra are obtained directly in the "fractional part" formalism
which unifies the treatments for the generic and root of unity cases. The
$q$-deformed quadratic Casimir operator is explicitly evaluated for the
representations presented.
