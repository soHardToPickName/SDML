Physics of Extra Dimensions as IR Limit of Four-Dimensional Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss the recent work done in collaboration with Chris Hill, Jing Wang
and Hsin-Chia Cheng. We construct four-dimensional renormalizable gauge
theories which, in their infrared limit, generate the dynamics of gauge
interactions in flat extra dimensions. In this construction, the Kaluza-Klein
states of extra dimensions arise from having many gauge symmetries in four
dimensions. The IR limit is determined by the dynamics of spontaneous breakdown
of those symmetries.
