Soliton quantization and internal symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the method of collective coordinate quantization to a model of
solitons in two spacetime dimensions with a global $U(1)$ symmetry. In
particular we consider the dynamics of the charged states associated with
rotational excitations of the soliton in the internal space and their
interactions with the quanta of the background field (mesons). By solving a
system of coupled saddle-point equations we effectively sum all tree-graphs
contributing to the one-point Green's function of the meson field in the
background of a rotating soliton. We find that the resulting one-point function
evaluated between soliton states of definite $U(1)$ charge exhibits a pole on
the meson mass shell and we extract the corresponding S-matrix element for the
decay of an excited state via the emission of a single meson using the standard
LSZ reduction formula. This S-matrix element has a natural interpretation in
terms of an effective Lagrangian for the charged soliton states with an
explicit Yukawa coupling to the meson field. We calculate the leading-order
semi-classical decay width of the excited soliton states discuss the
consequences of these results for the hadronic decay of the $\Delta$ resonance
in the Skyrme model.
