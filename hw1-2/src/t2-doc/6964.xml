Eigenfunctions of $GL(N,\RR)$ Toda chain: The Mellin-Barnes
  representation
</title>

<abstract>
  The recurrent relations between the eigenfunctions for $GL(N,\RR)$ and
$GL(N-1,\RR)$ quantum Toda chains is derived. As a corollary, the Mellin-Barnes
integral representation for the eigenfunctions of a quantum open Toda chain is
constructed for the $N$-particle case.
