Is the Lowest Order Supersymmetric WKB Approximation Exact for All Shape
  Invariant Potentials ?
</title>

<abstract>
  It has previously been proved that the lowest order supersymmetric WKB
approximation reproduces the exact bound state spectrum of shape invariant
potentials. We show that this is not true for a new, recently discovered class
of shape invariant potentials and analyse the reasons underlying this breakdown
of the usual proof.
