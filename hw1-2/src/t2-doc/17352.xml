Gauging the Central Charge
</title>

<abstract>
  We gauge the central charge of the N=2 supersymmetry algebra in rigid
superspace. The Fayet Sohnius hypermultiplet with gauged central charge
coincides on-shell with N=2 supersymmetric electrodynamics. The gauge couplings
of the vector-tensor multiplet turn out to be nonpolynomial.
