Differential Equations in Special Kahler Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of differential equations as they appear in special \K\
geometry of $N=2$ supergravity and $(2,2)$ vacua of the heterotic string is
summarized. Their use for computing couplings in the low energy effective
Lagrangians of string compactifications is outlined. (Talk presented at the
Workshop on String Theory, April 8--10, 1992, Trieste, Italy)
