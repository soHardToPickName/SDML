Black holes with complex multi-string configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  New exact solutions of Einstein equations which describe black hole with
radial cosmic strings are constructed in the paper. The case of infinitely thin
strings and the case of delocalized strings are considered. The case of
delocalized strings allows generalization to dimensions greater than 4.
