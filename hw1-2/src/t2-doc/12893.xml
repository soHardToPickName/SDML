Some functional solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation
</title>

<abstract>
  A general functional definition of the infinite dimensional quantum
$R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation is given. A procedure for the
extracting a finite dimensional $R$-matrix from the general definition is
demonstrated in a particular case when the group $SU(2)$ takes place.
