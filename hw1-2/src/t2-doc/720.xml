New Scaling Limit for Fuzzy Spheres
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a new scaling and a cut-off procedure, we show that phi^4 theory on a
deformed noncommutative R^4 can be obtained from the corresponding theory on
the fuzzy S^2 \times S^2. The star-product on this deformed noncommutative R^4
is non-associative, and the theory naturally has an ultra-violet cut-off,
Lambda = 2/\theta. We show that UV-IR mixing is absent to one loop, and that
the beta-function is the same as that of an ordinary phi^4 theory.
