On Quantization of Polynomial Momentum Observables
</title>

<abstract>
  The paper is devoted to quantization of polynomial momentum observables in
the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. A quantization procedure is proposed
allowing to quantize a wide class of functions which are polynomials of any
order in momenta. In the last part of the paper the quantum mechanics of scalar
particle in curved space-time is studied with the use of proposed approach.
