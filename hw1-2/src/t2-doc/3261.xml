On the non-abelian Born-Infeld action
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some aspects of the generalization of the Born-Infeld action to
non-abelian gauge groups and show how the discrepancy between Tseytlin's
symmetrized trace proposal and string theory can be corrected at order $F^6$.
We also comment on the possible quadratic order fermionic terms.
