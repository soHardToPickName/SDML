No-force condition and BPS combinations of p-branes in 11 and 10
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The condition of vanishing of static force on a q-brane probe in the
gravitational background produced by another p-brane is used to give a simple
derivation of the pair-wise intersection rules which govern the construction of
BPS combinations of branes. These rules, while implied also by supersymmetry
considerations, thus have purely bosonic origin. Imposing the no-force
requirement makes possible to add branes `one by one' to construct composite
BPS configurations (with zero binding energy) of 2-branes and 5-branes in D=11
and of various p-branes in D=10. The advantage of this elementary approach is
its universality, i.e. the cases of different dimensions and different types of
branes (e.g., NS-NS, R-R and `mixed' combinations of NS-NS and R-R branes in
D=10) are all treated in the same way.
