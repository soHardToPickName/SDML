Ultra-Multiplets: A New Representation of Rigid 2D, N = 8 Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  By utilizing a new procedure (the RADIO method) for deriving on-shell 2D,
2N-extended multiplets from off-shell 2D, N-extended multiplets, we derive a
new on-shell 2D, N = 8 representation; the ultra-multiplet. By twisting with
respect to parity, we show that many variant versions of this supermultiplet
also exist.
