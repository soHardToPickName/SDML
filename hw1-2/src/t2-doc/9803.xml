ON THE EQUIVALENCE AMONG SOME CHIRAL-BOSON THEORIES
</title>

<abstract>
  We make a comparative study of chiral-boson theories in the Florenani-Jackiw
(FJ) and linear constraint formulations. A special attention is given to the
case with an improved way of implementing the linear constraint. We show that
it has the same spectrum of the FJ formulation.
