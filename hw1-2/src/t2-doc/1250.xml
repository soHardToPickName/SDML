Kac-Moody Symmetries of IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the bosonic sector of IIB supergravity as a non-linear
realisation. We show that this non-linear realisation contains the Borel
subalgebras of SL(11) and $E_7$ and argue that it can be enlarged so as to be
based on the rank eleven Kac-Moody algebra $E_{11}$
