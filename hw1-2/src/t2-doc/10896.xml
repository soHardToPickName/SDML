Noncommutative ${\cal N}=1,2$ super U(N) Yang-Mills: UV/IR mixing and
  effective action results at one loop
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncommutative ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories with gauge group U(N) are studied here using the background field
method and superspace background covariant D-algebra in perturbation theory. At
one loop divergences arise only in the two-point functions. They are
logarithmic UV/IR divergences in the planar/nonplanar sectors that play a role
dual to each other. We compute the planar and non planar contributions to the
three- and four-point functions with vector external lines. We find that the
three-point function vanishes, while the four-point function receives
contributions both from vector and from chiral matter loops.
