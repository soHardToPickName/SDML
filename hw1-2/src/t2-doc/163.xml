Mirror symmetry for N=1 QED in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct three-dimensional N=1 QED with N_f flavors using branes of type
IIB string theory. This theory has a mirror, which can be realized using the
S-dual brane configuration. As in examples with more supersymmetry, the Higgs
branch of the original theory gets mapped into the Coulomb branch of the
mirror. We use parity invariance to argue that these branches cannot be lifted
by quantum corrections.
