More D-brane bound states
</title>

<abstract>
  The low-energy background field solutions corresponding to D-brane bound
states which possess a difference in dimension of two are presented. These
solutions are constructed using the T-duality map between the type IIA and IIB
superstring theories. Since supersymmetry is preserved by T-duality, the bound
state solutions retain the supersymmetric properties of the initial (single)
D-brane states from which they are produced, i.e., they preserve one half of
the supersymmetries.
