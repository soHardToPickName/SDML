Introduction to D-Branes, with Applications
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief review of some of the central ideas, terminology and techniques of
the technology of orientifolds and D-branes is presented. Some applications are
reviewed, including the construction of dual solitonic strings in the context
of string/string duality, the computation of the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy/area law for extremal black holes, and the construction of N=1 string
vacua in dimensions lower than ten. (Contribution to the proceedings of the
fourth International Workshop on Supersymmetry and Unification of Fundamental
Interactions (SUSY '96), held at the University of Maryland at College Park,
May 29 - June 1, 1996.)
