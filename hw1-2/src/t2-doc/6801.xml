Derivation of the Konishi anomaly relation from Dijkgraaf-Vafa with
  (Bi-)fundamental matters
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly write down the Feynman rules following the work of Dijkfraaf,
Vafa and collaborators for N=1 super Yang-Mills having products of SU groups as
the gauge group and matter chiral superfields in adjoint, fundamental, and
bi-fundamental representations without baryonic perturbations. As an
application of this, we show expectation values calculated by these methods
satisfy the Konishi anomaly relation.
