The Projective Unitary Irreducible Representations of the Poincar\'e
  Group in 1+2 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a complete analysis of the projective unitary irreducible
representations of the Poincar\'e group in 1+2 dimensions applying Mackey
theorem and using an explicit formula for the universal covering group of the
Lorentz group in 1+2 dimensions. We provide explicit formulae for all
representations.
