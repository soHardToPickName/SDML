Strong-Weak Coupling Duality in Three Dimensional String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Following an old result of Marcus and Schwarz we argue that in the heterotic
string theory compactified on a seven dimensional torus, the target space
duality group O(7,23;Z) and the strong-weak coupling duality transformations
combine into the group O(8,24;Z). We discuss symmetry of the combined spectrum
of elementary particles and solitons in the theory, and also show that the
existence of this symmetry predicts the number of harmonic forms on the moduli
space of periodic arrays of BPS monopoles in (3+1) dimensions. Finally, we show
that the O(8,24;Z) transformations relate the soliton solutions of Dabholkar
et. al. representing the fundamental string to the soliton solutions of Greene
et. al. representing `stringy cosmic strings'.
