Rotational Graviton Modes in the Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  For a brane world embedded in various ten or eleven-dimensional geometries,
we calculate the corrections to the four-dimensional gravitational potential
due to graviton modes propagating in the extra dimensions, including those
rotating around compact directions. Due to additional "warp" factors, these
rotation modes may have as significant an effect as the s-wave modes which
propagate in the large or infinite extra dimension.
