IR Duality in d=3 N=2 Supersymmetric USp(2N_c) and U(N_c) Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest IR-dual descriptions for d=3 N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories
with gauge groups USp(2N_c) and U(N_c) and matter in the fundamental
representation. We relate this duality to the IR duality of d=4 N=1 SQCD
theories, and in one case also to mirror symmetry.
