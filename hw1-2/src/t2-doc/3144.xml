Finite W_3 Transformations in a Multi-time Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical {\W}$_3$ transformations are discussed as restricted diffeomorphism
transformations (\W-Diff) in two-dimensional space. We formulate them by using
Riemannian geometry as a basic ingredient. The extended {\W}$_3$ generators are
given as particular combinations of Christoffel symbols. The defining equations
of \W-Diff are shown to depend on these generators explicitly. We also consider
the issues of finite transformations, global $SL(3)$ transformations and
\W-Schwarzians.
