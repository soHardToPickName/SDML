Superconformal 6D (2,0) theories in superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometrical construction of superconformal transformations in six
dimensional (2,0) superspace is proposed. Superconformal Killing vectors are
determined. It is shown that the transformation of the tensor multiplet
involves a zero curvature non-trivial cochain.
