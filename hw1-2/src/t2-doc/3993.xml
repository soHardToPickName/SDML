An Analogue of Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson Realizations for Lie
  Superalgebras. The Lie superalgebra sl(1/n)
</title>

<abstract>
  An analogue of the Holstein-Primakoff and of the Dyson realization for the
Lie superalgebra $sl(1/n)$ is written down. The expressions are formally the
same as for the Lie algebra $sl(n+1)$, however in the latter the Bose operators
have to be replaced with Fermi operators.
