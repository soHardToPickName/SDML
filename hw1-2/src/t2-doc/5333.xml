Quantum Mechanics of Integrable Spins on Coadjoint Orbits
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate classical integrable spins defined on the reduced phase spaces
of coadjoint orbits of $G= SU(N)$ and study quantum mechanics of them.
 After discussions on a complete set of commuting functions on each orbit and
construction of integrable spin models on the flag manifolds, we quantize a
concrete example of integrable spins on SU(3) flag manifold in the coherent
state quantization scheme and solve explicitly the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation.
