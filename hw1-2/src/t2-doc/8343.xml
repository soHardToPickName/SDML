Thermodynamics of the 3-State Potts Spin Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the relation of the infrared anomaly of conformal field theory
with entropy considerations of finite temperature thermodynamics for the
3-state Potts chain. We compute the free energy and compute the low temperature
specific heat for both the ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic spin chains,
and find the central charges for both.
