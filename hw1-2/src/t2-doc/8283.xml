On the structure of Verma module over Virasoro and Neveu-Schwarz
  algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In the paper we present a different proof of the theorem of B. L. Feigin and
D. B. Fuchs about the structure of Verma modules over Virasoro algebra. We
state some new results about the structure of Verma modules over Neveu-Schwarz.
The proof has thwo advantages: first, it is simplier in the most interesting
cases (for example in the so called minimal models), second, it can be
generalized for Neveu-Schwarz algebra for some class of Verma modules.
