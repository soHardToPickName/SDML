Nonlinear Integrable Equations and Nonlinear Fourier Transform
</title>

<abstract>
  In the paper we study nonlocal functionals whose kernels are homogeneous
generalized functions. We also use such functionals to solve the Korteweg-de
Vries , the nonlinear Schr\"odinger and the Davey-Stewartson equations.
