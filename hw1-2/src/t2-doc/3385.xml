Symplectic structure free Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The second class constraints algebra of the abelian Chern-Simons theory is
rigorously studied in terms of the Hamiltonian embedding in order to obtain the
first class constraint system. The symplectic structure of fields due to the
second class constraints disappears in the resulting system. Then we obtain a
new type of Chern-Simons action which has an infinite set of the irreducible
first class constraints and exhibits new extended local gauge symmetries
implemented by these first class constraints.
