R-Matrix Formulation of KP Hierarchies and their Gauge Equivalence
</title>

<abstract>
  The Adler-Kostant-Symes $R$-bracket scheme is applied to the algebra of
pseudo-differential operators to relate the three integrable hierarchies: KP
and its two modifications, known as nonstandard integrable models. All three
hierarchies are shown to be equivalent and connection is established in the
form of a symplectic gauge transformation. This construction results in a new
representation of the W-infinity algebras in terms of 4 bosonic fields.
