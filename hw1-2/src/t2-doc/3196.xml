Introduction to Supergravities in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Supergravities in four and higher dimensions are reviewed. We discuss the
action and its local symmetries of N=1 supergravity in four dimensions,
possible types of spinors in various dimensions, field contents of supergravity
multiplets, non-compact bosonic symmetries, non-linear sigma models, duality
symmetries of antisymmetric tensor fields and super p-branes. (An expanded
version of a review talk at YITP workshop on Supersymmetry, 27 - 30 March,
1996)
