Entropy of the three dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the three dimensional Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS$_3$) black hole
which corresponds essentially to a conical defect. We compute the mass of the
SdS$_3$ black hole from the correct definition of the mass in asymptotically de
Sitter space. Then we clarify the relation between the mass, entropy and
temperature for this black hole without any ambiguity. Also we establish the
SdS$_3$/CFT$_2$-correspondence for the entropy by applying the Cardy formula to
a CFT with a central charge $c=3\ell/2G_3$. Finally we discuss the entropy
bounds for the SdS$_3$ black hole.
