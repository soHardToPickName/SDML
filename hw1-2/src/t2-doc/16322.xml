A Realization of N=1 ${\cal SW}(3/2,2)$ Algebras with Wolf Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We find out that some unitary minimal models of the N=1 ${\cal SW}(3/2,2)$
superconformal algebra can be realized as the level one coset models based on
the Wolf spaces $SU(n)/(SU(n-2)\times SU(2))$. We obtain the expression of the
fermionic current with the conformal weight 5/2 in the algebra. Then, these
models are twisted to give the topological conformal field theories.
