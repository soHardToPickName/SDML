Coordinate System In Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a Gedanken experiment in which we construct a physical coordinate
system which covers the universe. Using general properties of quantum gravity
we find that the minimum uncertainty of the coordinate system is $\sqrt[5]{R}$
where $R$ is the radius of the universe
