Anomalous dimensions in gauge theories from rotating strings in
  $AdS_5\times S^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  Semi-classical soliton solutions for superstrings in $AdS_5\times S^5$ are
used to predict the dimension of gauge theory operators in $\N=4 $ SU(N) SYM
theory. We discuss the possible origin of scaling violations on the gauge
theory side.
