Intertwiners in Orbifold Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Following on from earlier work relating modules of meromorphic bosonic
conformal field theories to states representing solutions of certain simple
equations inside the theories, we show, in the context of orbifold theories,
that the intertwiners between twisted sectors are unique and described
explicitly in terms of the states corresponding to the relevant modules. No
explicit knowledge of the structure of the twisted sectors is required.
Further, we propose a general set of sufficiency conditions, illustrated in the
context of a third order no-fixed-point twist of a lattice theory, for
verifying consistency of arbitrary orbifold models in terms of the states
representing the twisted sectors.
