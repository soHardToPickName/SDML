Free fermionic higher spin fields in AdS(5)
</title>

<abstract>
  Totally symmetric massless fermionic fields of arbitrary spins in AdS(5) are
described as su(2,2) multispinors. The approach is based on the well-known
isomorfism o(4,2)=su(2,2). Explicitly gauge invariant higher spin free actions
are constructed and free field equations are analyzed.
