The Nappi-Witten example and gravitational waves
</title>

<abstract>
  The vanishing of the anomaly in the recent example of Nappi and Witten,
constructed from the Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on a certain non-semisimple
group, follows from a more general result valid for gravitational waves. The
construction of the metric is explained.}
