The Heterotic Enhancon
</title>

<abstract>
  The enhancon mechanism is studied in the heterotic string theory. We consider
the N_L=0 winding strings with momentum (NS1-W*) and the Kaluza-Klein dyons
(KK5-NS5*). The NS1-W* and KK5-NS5* systems are dualized to the D4-D0* and
D6-D2* systems, respectively, under the d=6 heterotic/IIA S-duality. The
heterotic form has a number of advantages over the type IIA form. We study
these backgrounds and obtain the enhancon radii by brane probe analysis. The
results are consistent with S-duality.
