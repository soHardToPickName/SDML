The Mirror Transform of Type I Vacua in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study certain compactifications of the type I string on K3. The three
topologically distinct choices of gauge bundle for the type I theory are shown
to be equivalent to type IIB orientifolds with different choices of background
anti-symmetric tensor field flux. Using a mirror transformation, we relate
these models to orientifolds with fixed seven planes, and without any
antisymmetric tensor field flux. This map allows us to relate these type I
vacua to particular six-dimensional F theory and heterotic string
compactifications.
