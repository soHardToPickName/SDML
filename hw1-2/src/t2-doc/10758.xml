Heat Bath Particle Number Spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the number spectrum of particles radiated during a scattering
into a heat bath using the thermal largest-time equation and the
Dyson-Schwinger equation. We show how one can systematically calculate
{d<N(\omega)>}/{d\omega} to any order using modified real time
finite-temperature diagrams. Our approach is demonstrated on a simple model
where two scalar particles scatter, within a photon-electron heat bath, into a
pair of charged particles and it is shown how to calculate the resulting
changes in the number spectra of the photons and electrons.
