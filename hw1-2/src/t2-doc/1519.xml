Non-critical string field theory for 2d quantum gravity coupled to
  (p,q)--conformal fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a non-critical string field theory for $2d$ quantum gravity
coupled to ($p$,$q$) conformal fields. The Hamiltonian is described by the
generators of the $W_p$ algebra, and the Schwinger-Dyson equation is equivalent
to a vacuum condition imposed on the generators of $W_p$ algebra.
