Decay widths in the massive Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  By a closer inspection of the massive Schwinger model within mass
perturbation theory we find that, in addition to the $n$-boson bound states, a
further type of hybrid bound states has to be included into the model. Further
we explicitly compute the decay widths of the three-boson bound state and of
the lightest hybrid bound state.
