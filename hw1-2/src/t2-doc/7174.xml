Dynamical mass generation in quantum field theory : some methods with
  application to the Gross-Neveu model and Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce some techniques to investigate dynamical mass generation. The
Gross-Neveu model (GN) is used as a toy model, because the GN mass gap is
exactly known, making it possible to check reliability of the various methods.
Very accurate results are obtained. Also application to SU(N) Yang-Mills (YM)
is discussed.
