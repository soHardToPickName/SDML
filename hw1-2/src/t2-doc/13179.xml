The cosmology with the Dp-brane gas
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effect of the Dp-brane gas in string cosmology. When one kind of
Dp-brane gas dominates, we find that the cosmology is equivalent to that of the
Brans-Dicke theory with the perfect fluid type matter. We obtain $\gamma$, the
equation of state parameter, in terms of p and the space-time dimension.
