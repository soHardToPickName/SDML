A Note on Singular Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider entropy of black holes which do not have finite area horizon.
It is suggested that some of them should have nonzero entropy from both
supergravity and string theory point of view. We also refine our arguments in
our previous papers for the existence of the microstates of the black hole.
