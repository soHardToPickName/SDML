Moving Mirrors and Thermodynamic Paradoxes
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum fields responding to "moving mirrors" have been predicted to give
rise to thermodynamic paradoxes. I show that the assumption in such work that
the mirror can be treated as an external field is invalid: the exotic
energy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales at
which the model is credible. For a first-quantized point-particle mirror, it
appears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in the
mirror's state. An accurate accounting of these energies will require a model
which recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity, and almost certainly a model
which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes, that is, a
second-quantized model.
