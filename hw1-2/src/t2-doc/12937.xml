A New Quantum Vortex Operator and Its Correlation Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A new local and gauge invariant quantum vortex operator is constructed in
three-dimensional gauge field theories. The correlation functions of this
operator are evaluated exactly in pure Maxwell theory and by means of a loop
expansion in the Abelian Higgs model. In the broken symmetry phase of the
latter an explicit expression for the mass of the quantum vortices is obtained
from the long distance exponential decay of the two-point function.
