Non-Commutative Space-Times, Black Hole, and Elementary Particle
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that elementary black hole can not be distinguished from an
elementary particle in the non-commutative space-times (space/space and
space/time) at the Planck scale. But, the non-commutative space-times can not
be ``directly'' measured in the elementary black hole system. A time-varying
non-commutative parameter $\theta(t)$ is suggested in accordance with the
time-varying-G scenario. By identifying the elementary black hole with an
elementary particle, the large hierarchy between the weak scale and Planck
scale is naturally understood. For large black hole, the discrete spectrum of
the horizon area is derived by identifying the black hole horizon with a
non-commutative sphere.
