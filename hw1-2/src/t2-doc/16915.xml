Applications of Supersymmetric Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Matrix models have wide applications in nuclear theory, condensed matter
theory and quantum field theory. I discuss supersymmetric extensions of matrix
models and their applications to branched polymers, the meander problem, and
superstrings in lower dimensions.
