One-Loop Renormalization of Higher-Derivative 2D Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A theory of higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity which has its roots in the
massive higher-spin mode dynamics of string theory is suggested. The
divergences of the effective action to one-loop are calculated, both in the
covariant and in the conformal gauge. Some technical problems which appear in
the calculations are discussed. An interpretation of the theory as a particular
D=2 higher-derivative $\sigma$-model is given. For a specific case of
higher-derivative 2D dilaton gravity, which is one loop multiplicatively
renormalizable, static configurations corresponding to black holes are shown to
exist.
