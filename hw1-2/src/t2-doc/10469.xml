Evaporation of charged black holes near extremality
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS_2\timesS^2 geometry of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
can be described by an effective solvable model which allows to follow
analytically the evaporation process including the backreaction. We find that
an infinite amount of time is required for the black hole to decay to
extremality.
