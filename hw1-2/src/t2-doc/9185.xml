Unification of Electromagnetic Interactions and Gravitational
  Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Unified theory of gravitational interactions and electromagnetic interactions
is discussed in this paper. Based on gauge principle, electromagnetic
interactions and gravitational interactions are formulated in the same manner
and are unified in a semi-direct product group of U(1) Abel gauge group and
gravitational gauge group.
