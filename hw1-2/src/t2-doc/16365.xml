Anomalies of the SO(32) five-brane and their cancellation
</title>

<abstract>
  The anomaly due to the chiral fermions on the world-volume of the SO(32)
five-brane is calculated. It is shown that this contribution has the correct
structure for it to be cancelled by the variation of the classical world-volume
action. The cancellation mechanism requires a Green-Schwarz-like term in the
classical action. The result confirms the field content of the SO(32)
five-brane proposed by Witten.
