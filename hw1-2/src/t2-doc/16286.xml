BFV analysis of the $U_{EM}(1)$ gauged SU(3) WZW model and the
  Faddeev-Jackiw approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The four dimensional SU(3) WZW model coupled to electromagnetism is treated
as a constrained system in the context of Batalin-Fradkin- Vilkovisky
formalism. It is shown that this treatment is equivalent to the Faddeev-Jackiw
(FJ) approach. It is also shown that the field redefinitions that transform the
fields of the model into BRST and $\sigma$ closed are actually the Darboux's
transformations used in the FJ formalism.
