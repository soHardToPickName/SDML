Geometrical approach to the evaluation of multileg Feynman diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  A connection between one-loop $N$-point Feynman diagrams and certain
geometrical quantities in non-Euclidean geometry is discussed. A geometrical
way to calculate the corresponding Feynman integrals is considered. (This paper
contains a brief review of the results presented in hep-th/9709216).
