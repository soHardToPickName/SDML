From Black Strings to Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Using recently developed numerical methods, we examine neutral compactified
non-uniform black strings which connect to the Gregory-Laflamme critical point.
By studying the geometry of the horizon we give evidence that this branch of
solutions may connect to the black hole solutions, as conjectured by Kol. We
find the geometry of the topology changing solution is likely to be nakedly
singular at the point where the horizon radius is zero. We show that these
solutions can all be expressed in the coordinate system discussed by Harmark
and Obers.
