Matrix string states in pure 2d Yang Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize pure 2d Yang-Mills theory on a torus in the gauge where the field
strength is diagonal. Because of the topological obstructions to a global
smooth diagonalization, we find string-like states in the spectrum similar to
the ones introduced by various authors in Matrix string theory. We write
explicitly the partition function, which generalizes the one already known in
the literature, and we discuss the role of these states in preserving modular
invariance. Some speculations are presented about the interpretation of 2d
Yang-Mills theory as a Matrix string theory.
