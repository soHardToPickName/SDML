Open string - BMN operator correspondence in the weak coupling regime
</title>

<abstract>
  We reproduce the correspondence between open string states |n> and BMN
operators O_n in N=2 supersymmetric gauge theory using a worldsheet computation
with the relation <B|n>=O_n, where <B| is a boundary state of D3-branes. We
regard the NS ground states and their excitations with respect to a bosonic
oscillator as the states |n> and obtain a chiral operator and BMN operators,
respectively, in correspondence to them. Because we take the coupling constant
to be weak and the background spacetime to be flat Minkowski, not AdS, the
string states |n> are circular waves around the D3-branes, instead of KK modes
on S^5. We also discuss the 1/J correction to the correspondence.
