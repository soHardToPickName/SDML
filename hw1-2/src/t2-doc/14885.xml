FADDEEV-JACKIW APPROACH TO HIDDEN SYMMETRIES
</title>

<abstract>
The study of hidden symmetries within Dirac's formalism does not possess a
systematic procedure due to the lack of first-class constraints to act as
symmetry generators. On the other hand, in the Faddeev-Jackiw approach, gauge
and reparametrization symmetries are generated by the null eigenvectors of the
sympletic matrix and not by constraints, suggesting the possibility of dealing
systematically with hidden symmetries throughout this formalism. It is shown in
this paper that indeed hidden symmetries of noninvariant or gauge fixed systems
are equally well described by null eigenvectors of the sympletic matrix, just
as the explicit invariances. The Faddeev-Jackiw approach therefore provides a
systematic algorithm for treating all sorts of symmetries in an unified way.
This technique is illustrated here by the SL(2,R) affine Lie algebra of the 2-D
induced gravity proposed by Polyakov, which is a hidden symmetry in the
canonical approach of constrained systems via Dirac's method, after conformal
and reparametrization invariances have been fixed.
