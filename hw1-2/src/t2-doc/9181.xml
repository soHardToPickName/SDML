Area law corrections from state counting and supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Modifications of the Bekenstein-Hawking area law for black holes are crucial
in order to find agreement between the microscopic entropy based on state
counting and the macroscopic entropy based on an effective field theory
computation. We discuss this and related issues for the case of
four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric black holes. We also briefly comment on the
state counting for N=4 and N=8 black holes.
