Quantum dynamics of N=1, D=4 supergravity chiral compensator
</title>

<abstract>
  A new four-dimensional $N=1$ superfield model is suggested. The model is
induced by supertrace anomaly of matter superfields in curved superspace and
leads to effective theory of supergravity chiral compensator. A renormalization
structure of this model is studied, one-loop counterterms are calculated and
renormalization group equations are investigated. It is shown that the theory
under consideration is infrared free.
