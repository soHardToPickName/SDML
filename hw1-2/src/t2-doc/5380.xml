Anomaly Cancellations and String Symmetries in the Effective Field
  Theory

<abstract>
  This contribution briefly describes some developments of the use of string
symmetries and anomaly cancellation mechanisms to include string loop
corrections in the construction of the low-energy effective supergravity of
superstrings. (Presented at the 27th International Conference on High Energy
Physics, Glasgow, July 1994)
