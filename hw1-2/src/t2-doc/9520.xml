Supergravity Solutions for Localised Brane Intersections
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general method for constructing supergravity solutions for
intersecting branes. The solutions are written in terms of a single function,
which is the solution to a nonlinear differential equation. We illustrate this
procedure in detail for the case of M2-branes ending on M5-branes. We also
present supergravity solutions for strings ending on Dp-branes. Unlike previous
results in the literature, these branes are completely localized.
