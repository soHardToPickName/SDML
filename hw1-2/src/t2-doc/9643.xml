Tachyon Condensation in Rotated Brane Configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  The decay of rotated brane configurations and the corresponding condensation
of tachyons is discussed. In a certain IIB orbifold case a heuristic argument
about the mass of the state living on the fixed plane is made. When the
rotation angle is $\pi$ this mass agrees with that obtained by Sen.
