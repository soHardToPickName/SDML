Projective Invariance and One-Loop Effective Action in Affine-Metric
  Gravity Interacting with Scalar Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the influence of the projective invariance on the
renormalization properties of the theory. One-loop counterterms are calculated
in the most general case of interaction of gravity with scalar field.
