Diffeomorphism invariant SU(N) gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a class of diffeomorphism invariant SU(N) gauge theories in N^2
dimensions, together with some matter couplings. These theories have
(N^2-3)(N^2-1) local degrees of freedom, and have the unusual feature that the
constraint associated with time reparametrizations is identically satisfied. A
related class of SU(N) theories in N^2-1 dimensions has the constraint algebra
of general relativity, but has more degrees of freedom. Non-perturbative
quantization of the first type of theory via SU(N) spin networks is briefly
outlined.
