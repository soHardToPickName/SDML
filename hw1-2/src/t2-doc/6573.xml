Boson--fermion bound states in two dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the boson--fermion bound state equation in a two dimensional gauge
theory in the large--$\nc$ limit. We analyze the properties of this equation
and in particular, find that the mass trajectory is linear with respect to the
bound state level for the higher mass states.
