The correlation functions of the D_6 conformal model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work, we exploit the operator content of the D$_{6}$ conformal
algebra. By constructing a $Z_{2}$-invariants fusion rules of a chosen
subalgebra and by resolving the bootstrap equations consistent with these
rules, we determine the structure constants of the subalgebra.
