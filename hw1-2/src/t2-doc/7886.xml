</title>

<abstract>
  Lectures given at the Trieste Summer School, 1992. These notes are an update
of my review article "Classical and Quantum W-Gravity", preprint QMW-92-1,
published in in "Strings and Symmetries 1991", with some extra material on
W-geometry, W-symmetry in conformal field theory and W-strings.
