Open Superstring Star as a Continuous Moyal Product
</title>

<abstract>
  By diagonalizing the three-string vertex and using a special coordinate
representation the matter part of the open superstring star is identified with
the continuous Moyal product of functions of anti-commuting variables. We show
that in this representation the identity and sliver have simple expressions.
The relation with the half-string fermionic variables in continuous basis is
given.
