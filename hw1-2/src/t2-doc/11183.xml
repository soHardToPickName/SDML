Elements of Reality and the Failure of the Product Rule Measurability of
  Commuting Observables
</title>

<abstract>
  The concept of ``elements of reality" is analyzed within the framework of
quantum theory. It is shown that elements of reality fail to fulfill the
product rule. This is the core of recent proofs of the impossibility of a
Lorentz-invariant interpretation of quantum mechanics. A generalization and
extension of the concept of elements of reality is presented.
Lorentz-invariance is restored by giving up the product rule. The consequences
of giving up the ``and" rule, which must be abandoned together with the product
rule, are discussed.
