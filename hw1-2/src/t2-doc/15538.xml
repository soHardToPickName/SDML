Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Achucarro-Ortiz Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper it is shown that the entropy of the black hole horizon in the
Achucarro-Ortiz spacetime, which is the most general two-dimensional black hole
derived from the three-dimensional rotating BTZ black hole, can be described by
the Cardy-Verlinde formula. The latter is supposed to be an entropy formula of
conformal field theory in any dimension.
