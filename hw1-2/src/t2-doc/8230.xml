S-Duality for Linearized Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We develope the analogue of S-duality for linearized gravity in
(3+1)-dimensions. Our basic idea is to consider the self-dual (anti-self-dual)
curvature tensor for linearized gravity in the context of the
Macdowell-Mansouri formalism. We find that the strong-weak coupling duality for
linearized gravity is an exact symmetry and implies small-large duality for the
cosmological constant.
