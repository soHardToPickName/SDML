Renormalizing a BRST-invariant composite operator of mass dimension 2 in
  Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the renormalization of a BRST and anti-BRST invariant composite
operator of mass dimension 2 in Yang-Mills theory with the general BRST and
anti-BRST invariant gauge fixing term of the Lorentz type. The interest of this
study stems from a recent claim that the non-vanishing vacuum condensate of the
composite operator in question can be an origin of mass gap and quark
confinement in any manifestly covariant gauge, as proposed by one of the
authors. First, we obtain the renormalization group flow of the Yang-Mills
theory. Next, we show the multiplicative renormalizability of the composite
operator and that the BRST and anti-BRST invariance of the bare composite
operator is preserved under the renormalization. Third, we perform the operator
product expansion of the gluon and ghost propagators and obtain the Wilson
coefficient corresponding to the vacuum condensate of mass dimension 2.
Finally, we discuss the connection of this work with the previous works and
argue the physical implications of the obtained results.
