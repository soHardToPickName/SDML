London's Equation from Abelian Projection
</title>

<abstract>
  Confinement in non-Abelian gauge theories, such as QCD, is often explained
using an analogy to type II superconductivity. In this analogy the existence of
the ``Meissner'' effect for quarks with respect to the QCD vacuum is an
important element. Here we show that using the ideas of Abelian projection it
is possible to arrive at an effective London equation from a non-Abelian gauge
theory. (London's equation gave a phenomenological description of the Meissner
effect prior to the Ginzburg-Landau or BCS theory of superconductors). The
Abelian projected gauge field acts as the E&M field in normal
superconductivity, while the remaining non-Abelian components form a gluon
condensate which is described via an effective scalar field. This effective
scalar field plays a role similar to the scalar field in Ginzburg-Landau
theory.
