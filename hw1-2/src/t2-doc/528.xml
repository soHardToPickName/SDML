Non-Perturbative Dynamics in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I give an introductory review of recent, fascinating developments in
supersymmetric gauge theories. I explain pedagogically the miraculous
properties of supersymmetric gauge dynamics allowing one to obtain exact
solutions in many instances. Various dynamical regimes emerging in
supersymmetric Quantum Chromodynamics and its generalizations are discussed. I
emphasize those features that have a chance of survival in QCD and those which
are drastically different in supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric gauge
theories.
  Unlike most of the recent reviews focusing almost entirely on the progress in
extended supersymmetries (the Seiberg-Witten solution of N=2 models), these
lectures are mainly devoted to N=1 theories. The primary task is extracting
lessons for non-supersymmetric theories.
