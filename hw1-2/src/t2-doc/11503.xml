Casimir Energy of Confined Fields: A Role of the RG Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  A role of the renormalization group invariance in calculations of the ground
state energy for models with confined fermion fields is discussed. The case of
the (1+1)D MIT bag with massive fermions is studied in detail.
