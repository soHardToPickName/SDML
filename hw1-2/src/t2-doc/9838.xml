Zamolodchikov's c-function for the Chiral Gross-Neveu Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Zamolodchikov's c-function for the Chiral Gross-Neveu Model
up to two loops. We show that the c-function interpolates between the two known
critical points of the theory, it is stationary at them and it decreases with
the running coupling constant. In particular one can infer the non-existence of
additional critical points in the region under investigation.
