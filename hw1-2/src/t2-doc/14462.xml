Perturbative Expansion around the Gaussian Effective Action: The
  Background Field Method
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a systematic method of the perturbative expansion around the
Gaussian effective action based on the background field method. We show, by
applying the method to the quantum mechanical anharmonic oscillator problem,
that even the first non-trivial correction terms greatly improve the Gaussian
approximation.
