A New Type of Massive Spin-One Boson: and its Relation with Maxwell
  Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  First, we show that in the $(1,0)\oplus(0,1)$ representation space there
exist not one but two theories for charged particles. In the Weinberg
construct, the boson and its antiboson carry {\it same} relative intrinsic
parity, whereas in our construct the relative intrinsic parities of the boson
and its antiboson are {\it opposite}. These results originate from the
commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation and Parity in Weinberg's
theory, and from the anti-commutativity of the operations of Charge conjugation
and Parity in our theory. We thus claim that we have constructed a first
non-trivial quantum theory of fields for the Wigner-type particles. Second, the
massless limit of both theories seems formally identical and suggests a
fundamental modification of Maxwell equations. At its simplest level, the
modification to Maxwell equations enters via additional boundary condition(s).
