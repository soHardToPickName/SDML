An Algebraic Approach to Form Factors
</title>

<abstract>
  An associative $*$-algebra is introduced (containing a $TTR$-algebra as a
subalgebra) that implements the form factor axioms, and hence indirectly the
Wightman axioms, in the following sense: Each $T$-invariant linear functional
over the algebra automatically satisfies all the form factor axioms. It is
argued that this answers the question (posed in the functional Bethe ansatz)
how to select the dynamically correct representations of the $TTR$-algebra.
Applied to the case of integrable QFTs with diagonal factorized scattering
theory a universal formula for the eigenvalues of the conserved charges
emerges.
