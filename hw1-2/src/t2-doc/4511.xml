3D reduction of the three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a 3D approximation of the three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation.
Our 3D equation is covariantly cluster separable and the two-fermion cluster
separated limits are exact equivalents of the corresponding two-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equations. The potentials include positive free energy
projectors in order to avoid continuum dissolution.
