Cosmological Perturbations from a New-Physics Hypersurface
</title>

<abstract>
  Within a broad class of inflationary models we critically analyze the way
initial quantum fluctuations on a new-physics hypersurface (NPH) affect
standard predictions for large-scale cosmological perturbations. We find that
these so-called transplanckian effects depend crucially on the definition of
the "vacuum state" in particular on which Hamiltonian is minimized on the NPH
in order to select such a state. Transplanckian effects can be made much
smaller than previously suggested if sufficiently "adiabatic" Hamiltonians are
minimized.
