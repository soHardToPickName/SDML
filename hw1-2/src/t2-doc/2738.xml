2D Supergravity and Integrable Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Integrable hierarchy based on the constrained Osp(2$\mid%2) connection is
considered. The connection with 2D supergravity and some analogies with the
W$_3^{(2)}$ case are given. It is shown that super Virasoro transformations are
symmetries of tha hierarchy.
