Coordinate-space holographic projection of fields and an application to
  massive vector fields
</title>

<abstract>
  General properties of coordinate-space holographic projections of fields in
AdS/CFT correspondence, which respect the Ward identity, are investigated. To
show the usefulness of this methodology it is applied to the computation of
correlators of massive gauge fields.
