On Electromagnetic Duality in Locally Supersymmetric N=2 Yang--Mills
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider duality transformations in N=2 Yang--Mills theory coupled to N=2
supergravity, in a manifestly symplectic and coordinate covariant setting. We
give the essential of the geometrical framework which allows one to discuss
stringy classical and quantum monodromies, the form of the spectrum of BPS
saturated states and the Picard--Fuchs identities encoded in the special
geometry of N=2 supergravity theories.
