String Theory Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  A brief review of the status of duality symmetries in string theory is
presented. The evidence is accumulating rapidly that an enormous group of
duality symmetries, including perturbative T dualities and non-perturbative
S-dualities, underlies string theory. It is my hope that an understanding of
these symmetries will suggest the right way to formulate non-perturbative
string theory. Whether or not this hope is realized, it has already been
demonstrated that this line of inquiry leads to powerful new tools for
understanding gauge theories and new evidence for the uniqueness of string
theory, as well as deep mathematical results.
