Topological Modes in Dual Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Lattice gauge theory with gauge group $Z_{P}$ is reconsidered in four
dimensions on a simplicial complex $K$. One finds that the dual theory,
formulated on the dual block complex $\hat{K}$, contains topological modes
which are in correspondence with the cohomology group $H^{2}(\hat{K},Z_{P})$,
in addition to the usual dynamical link variables. This is a general phenomenon
in all models with single plaquette based actions; the action of the dual
theory becomes twisted with a field representing the above cohomology class. A
similar observation is made about the dual version of the three dimensional
Ising model. The importance of distinct topological sectors is confirmed
numerically in the two dimensional Ising model where they are parameterized by
$H^{1}(\hat{K},Z_{2})$.
