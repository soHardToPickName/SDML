Three dimensional fermionic determinants, Chern-Simons and nonlinear
  field redefinitions
</title>

<abstract>
  The three dimensional abelian fermionic determinant of a two component
massive spinor in flat euclidean space-time is resetted to a pure Chern-Simons
action through a nonlinear redefinition of the gauge field.
