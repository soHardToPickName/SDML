  Ladders of field polynomial differential forms obeying systems of descent
equations and corresponding to observables and anomalies of gauge theories are
renormalized. They obey renormalized descent equations. Moreover they are shown
to have vanishing anomalous dimensions. As an application a simple proof of the
nonrenormalization theorem for the nonabelian gauge anomaly is given.
