Covariant Gauges for Constrained Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The method of constructing of extended phase space for singular theories
which permits the consideration of covariant gauges without the introducing of
a ghost fields, is proposed. The extension of the phase space is carried out by
the identification of the initial theory with an equivalent theory with higher
derivatives and applying to it the Ostrogradsky method of Hamiltonian
