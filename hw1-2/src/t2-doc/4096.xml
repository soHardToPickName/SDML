Spinning particles in $2+1$ dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of a free spinning particle in
2+1-dimensions or {\it anyon} are established, following closely the analysis
of Hanson and Regge. Two viable (and inequivalent) Lagrangians are derived. It
is also argued that one of them is more favourable. In the Hamiltonian analysis
non-triviaal Dirac Brackets of the fundamental variables are computed for both
the models. Important qualitative differences with a recently proposed model
for anyons are pointed out.
