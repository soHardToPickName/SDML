Consistent and covariant commutator anomalies in the chiral Schwinger
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive all covariant and consistent divergence and commutator anomalies of
chiral QED$_2$ within the framework of canonical quantization of the fermions.
Further, we compute the time evolution of all occurring operators and find that
all commutators evolve canonically. We comment on the relation of our results
to the finding of a nontrivial U(1)-curvature in gauge-field space.
