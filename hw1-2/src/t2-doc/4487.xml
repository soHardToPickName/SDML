Parity Violation in the Three Dimensional Thirring Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss parity violation in the 3-dimensional (N flavour) Thirring model.
We find that the ground state fermion current in a background gauge field does
not posses a well defined parity transformation. We also investigate the
connection between parity violation and fermion mass generation, proving that
radiative corrections force the fermions to be massive.
