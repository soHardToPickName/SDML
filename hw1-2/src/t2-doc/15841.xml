Charge screening and confinement in the massive Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of Euclidean path integral and mass perturbation theory
we compute the Wilson loop of widely separated external charges for the massive
Schwinger model. From this result we show for arbitrary order mass perturbation
theory that integer external charges are completely screened, whereas for
noninteger charges a constant long-range force remains.
