A note on Burgers' turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note the Polyakov equation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 52} (1995) 6183] for
the velocity-difference PDF, with the exciting force correlation function
$\kappa (y)\sim1-y^{\alpha}$ is analyzed. Several solvable cases are
considered, which are in a good agreement with available numerical results.
Then it is shown how the method developed by A. Polyakov can be applied to
turbulence with short-scale-correlated forces, a situation considered in models
of self-organized criticality.
