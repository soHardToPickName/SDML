Quantum Deformations of Space-Time SUSY and Noncommutative Superfield
  Theory

<abstract>
  We review shortly present status of quantum deformations of Poincar\'{e} and
conformal supersymmetries. After recalling the $\kappa$-deformation of
$\hbox{D=4}$ Poincar\'{e} supersymmetries we describe the corresponding star
product multiplication for chiral superfields. In order to describe the
deformation of chiral vertices in momentum space the integration formula over
$\kappa$-deformed chiral superspace is proposed.
