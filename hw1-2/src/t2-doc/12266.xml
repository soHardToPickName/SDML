Fateev-Zamolodchikov spin chain: excitation spectrum, completeness and
  thermodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The sector of zero $Z_{N}$-charge is studied for the ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) version of the $Z_{N}\times Z_{2}$ invariant
Fateev-Zamolodchikov quantum spin chain. We conjecture that the relevant Bethe
ansatz equations should admit, beside the usual string-like solutions,
exceptional multiplets, and a number of non-physical solutions. Once the
physical ones are identified, we show how to get completeness and the gapless
excitation spectrum. The central charge is computed from the specific heat and
found to be $c=2\frac{N-1}{N+2}$ (FM) and $c=1$ (AFM).
