A universal amplitude ratio for the q<4 Potts model from a solvable
  lattice model
</title>

<abstract>
  The universal amplitude ratio $R_{\xi}$ for the ($q\leqslant 4$)-state Potts
model in two dimensions is determined by using results for the dilute A model
in regime 1. The nature of the relationship between the Potts model and the
dilute A model, both related to $\phi_{2,1}$ perturbed conformal field theory,
is discussed.
