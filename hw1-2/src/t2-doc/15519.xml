Generalized quantum dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generalization of Heisenberg picture quantum mechanics in which
a Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics is formulated directly for dynamical
systems on a manifold with non--commuting coordinates, which act as operators
on an underlying Hilbert space. This is accomplished by defining the Lagrangian
and Hamiltonian as the real part of a graded total trace over the underlying
Hilbert space, permitting a consistent definition of the first variational
derivative with respect to a general operator--valued coordinate. The
Hamiltonian form of the equations is expressed in terms of a generalized
bracket operation, which is conjectured to obey a Jacobi identity. The
formalism permits the natural implementation of gauge invariance under
operator--valued gauge transformations. When an operator Hamiltonian exists as
well as a total trace Hamiltonian, as is generally the case in complex quantum
mechanics, one can make an operator gauge transformation from the Heisenberg to
the Schr\"odinger picture. When applied to complex quantum mechanical systems
with one bosonic or fermionic degree of freedom, the formalism gives the usual
operator equations of motion, with the canonical commutation relations emerging
as constraints associated with the operator gauge invariance. More generally,
our methods permit the formulation of quaternionic quantum field theories with
operator--valued gauge invariance, in which we conjecture that the operator
constraints act as a generalization of the usual canonical commutators.
