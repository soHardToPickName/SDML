The renormalized $\phi^4_4$-trajectory by perturbation theory in the
  running coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the renormalized trajectory of $\phi^4_4$-theory by perturbation
theory in a running coupling. We introduce an iterative scheme without
reference to a bare action. The expansion is proved to be finite to every order
of perturbation theory.
