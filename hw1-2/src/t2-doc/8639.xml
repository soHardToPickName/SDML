De Rham Cohomology of the Supermanifolds and Superstring BRST Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the BRST operator of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond superstring is closely
related to de Rham differential on the moduli space of decorated super-Riemann
surfaces P. We develop formalism where superstring amplitudes are computed via
integration of some differential forms over a section of P over the super
moduli space M. We show that the result of integration does not depend on the
choice of section when all the states are BRST physical. Our approach is based
on the geometrical theory of integration on supermanifolds of which we give a
short review.
