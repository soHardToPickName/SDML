Scalar Absorption and the Breaking of the World Volume Conformal
  Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a version of fixed scalars for non-dilatonic branes which
correspond to dilatations of the brane world-volume. We obtain a cross-section
whose world-volume interpretation falls out naturally from an investigation of
the breaking of conformal invariance by the irrelevant Born-Infeld corrections
to Yang-Mills theory. From the same irrelevant world-volume operator we obtain
the leading correction to the cross-sections of minimal scalars. This
correction can be obtained in supergravity via an improved matching of inner
and outer solutions to the minimal wave equation.
