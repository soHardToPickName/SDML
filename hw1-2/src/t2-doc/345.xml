Notes on Heterotic Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  In this technical note we describe a pair of results on heterotic
compactifications. First, we give an example demonstrating that the usual
statement of the anomaly-freedom constraint for perturbative heterotic
compactifications (meaning, matching second Chern characters) is incorrect for
compactifications involving torsion-free sheaves. Secondly, we correct errors
in the literature regarding the counting of massless particles in heterotic
compactifications.
