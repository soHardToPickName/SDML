Exact Solution to the One-Plaquette Model of Induced QCD at Large $N$
</title>

<abstract>
  The induced lattice gauge theory with various types of inducing fields in
fundamental representation of $SU(N_{c})$ is considered.
  In a simple case of one-plaquette lattice the model is solved in the large
$N_{c}$ limit by means of loop equations.
  Comparison with the solution of usual QCD shows the equivalence of induced
and Wilson QCD providing that a mass and a number of flavours of inducing
fields are sufficiently large. The possibility to take an asymptotically free
continuum limit of induced QCD is discussed.
