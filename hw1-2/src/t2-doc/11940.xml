Dilatonic black holes in theories with moduli fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the low-energy effective string theory when moduli of the
compactified manifold are present. Assuming a nontrivial coupling of the moduli
to the Maxwell tensor, we find a class of regular black hole solutions. Both
the thermodynamical and the geometrical structure of these solutions are
discussed
