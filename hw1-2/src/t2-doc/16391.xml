Moduli Space of Global Symmetry in N=1 Supersymmetric Theories and the
  Quasi-Nambu-Goldstone Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the moduli space for the global symmetry in N=1 supersymmetric
theories. We show, at the generic points, it coincides with the space of
quasi-Nambu-Goldstone (QNG) bosons, which appear besides the ordinary
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons when global symmetry G breaks down spontaneously to
its subgroup H with preserving N=1 supersymmetry. At the singular points, most
of the NG bosons change to the QNG bosons and the unbroken global symmetry is
enhanced. The G-orbits parametrized by the NG bosons are the fibre at the
moduli space and the singular points correspond to the point where H-orbit (in
G-orbit) shrinks. We also show the low-energy effective Lagrangian is the
arbitrary function of the orbit map.
