The topology of multi-coupling deformations of CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the topological properties of the manifold of coupling constants
for multi-coupling deformations of conformal field theories. We calculate the
Euler and Betti numbers and briefly discuss physical applications of these
results.
