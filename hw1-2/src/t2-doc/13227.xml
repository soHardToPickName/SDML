Induced Chern-Simons and WZW action in Noncommutative Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider noncommutative gauge theory with Dirac or Majorana fermions in
odd dimensional spacetime and compute the induced noncommutative Chern-Simons
action generated at 1-loop. We observe that the Chern-Simons term induced by a
Dirac fermion has a smooth limit when $\th ---> 0$, but there is a finite jump
for the Chern-Simons term induced by a Majorana spinor. The induced
Chern-Simons action from a Majorana spinor is nonvanishing even in the $\th
---> 0$ limit, a discontinuity that shares a similar characteristic as the
UV/IR singularity discovered originally by Minwalla, Raamsdonk and Seiberg.
Properties of the noncommutative WZW action are also discussed.
