The Preferred Frame and Poincare Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we describe a covariant canonical formalism for a free
time-like (massive) as well as space-like (tachyonic) particle in the framework
of nonstandard synchronization scheme. In this scheme one is able to introduce
absolute causality without breaking the Poincar\'e invariance.
