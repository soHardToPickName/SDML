Correction terms to Newton law due to induced gravity in AdS background
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate small correction terms to gravitational potential on
Randall-Sundrum brane with an induced Einstein term. The behaviors of the
correction terms depend on the magnitudes of $AdS$ radius $k^{-1}$ and a
characteristic length scale $\l$ of model. We represent the gravitational
potential for arbitrary $k$ and $\l$ at all distances.
