2+1 Gravity without dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  A three dimensional generally covariant theory is described that has a 2+1
canonical decomposition in which the Hamiltonian constraint, which generates
the dynamics, is absent. Physical observables for the theory are described and
the classical and quantum theories are compared with ordinary 2+1 gravity.
