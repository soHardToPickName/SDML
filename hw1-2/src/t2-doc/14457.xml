On the virial coefficients of nonabelian anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a system of nonabelian anyons in the lowest Landau level of a strong
magnetic field. Using diagrammatic techniques, we prove that the virial
coefficients do not depend on the statistics parameter. This is true for all
representations of all nonabelian groups for the statistics of the particles
and relies solely on the fact that the effective statistical interaction is a
traceless operator.
