Space-wave function duality and enhanced dKdV on a Riemann surface
</title>

<abstract>
  For certain situations relations are indicated between the space-wave
function duality of Faraggi-Matone, enhanced dispersionless KdV, and Whitham
dynamics for appropriate hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces related to
Seiberg-Witten theory. This paper gives refinements of hep-th/9702138 and some
new ideas.
