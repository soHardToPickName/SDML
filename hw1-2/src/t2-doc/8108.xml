Descent Relations Among Bosonic D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the tachyonic kink solution on a pair of D-p-branes in the
bosonic string theory can be identified with the D-(p-1)-brane of the same
theory. We also speculate on the possibility of obtaining the D-(p-1)-brane as
a tachyonic lump on a single D-p-brane. We suggest a possible reinterpretation
of the first result which unifies these two apparently different descriptions
of the D-(p-1) brane.
