Negative Dimensional Integration: "Lab Testing" at Two Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  Negative dimensional integration method (NDIM) is a technique to deal with
D-dimensional Feynman loop integrals. Since most of the physical quantities in
perturbative Quantum Field Theory (pQFT) require the ability of solving them,
the quicker and easier the method to evaluate them the better. The NDIM is a
novel and promising technique, ipso facto requiring that we put it to test in
different contexts and situations and compare the results it yields with those
that we already know by other well-established methods. It is in this
perspective that we consider here the calculation of an on-shell two-loop three
point function in a massless theory. Surprisingly this approach provides twelve
non-trivial results in terms of double power series. More astonishing than this
is the fact that we can show these twelve solutions to be different
representations for the same well-known single result obtained via other
methods. It really comes to us as a surprise that the solution for the
particular integral we are dealing with is twelvefold degenerate.
