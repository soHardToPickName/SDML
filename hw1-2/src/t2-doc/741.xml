Domain Wall Dynamics of Phase Interfaces

<abstract>
  The statics and dynamics of a surface separating two phases of a relativistic
quantum field theory at or near the critical temperature typically make use of
a free energy as a functional of an order parameter. This free energy
functional also affords an economical description of states away from
equilibrium. The similarities and differences between using a scalar field as
the order parameter versus the energy density are examined, and a peculiarity
is noted. We also point out several conceptual errors in the literature dealing
with the dynamical prefactor in the nucleation rate.
