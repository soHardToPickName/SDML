Scaling fields in the two-dimensional abelian sandpile model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the isotropic two-dimensional abelian sandpile model from a
perspective based on two-dimensional (conformal) field theory. We compute
lattice correlation functions for various cluster variables (at and off
criticality), from which we infer the field-theoretic description in the
scaling limit. We find a perfect agreement with the predictions of a c=-2
conformal field theory and its massive perturbation, thereby providing direct
evidence for conformal invariance and more generally for a description in terms
of a local field theory. The question of the height 2 variable is also
addressed, with however no definite conclusion yet.
