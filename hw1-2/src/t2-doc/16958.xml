String Hypothesis and Characters of Coset CFTs
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an algorithm for the construction of the branching functions in
the vacuum sector for affine Lie algebras based on the string hypothesis
solution to a system of Bethe equations for generalized RSOS models. We also
mention how the ground state structure and features of the excitation spectra
like the Brillouin zone schemes of these models (and those in the same
universality classes) can be extracted from combinatoric arguments and encoded
in Lie algebraic terms.
