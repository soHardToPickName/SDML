A Note of W-algebra Realisations
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a general description of realisations of W--algebras in terms of
smaller W--algebras and free fields. This is based on the definition of the
W--algebra as the commutant of a set of screening charges. This is conjectured
to be related to partial gauge-fixings in the Hamiltonian reduction model.
