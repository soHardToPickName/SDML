Black-hole thermodynamics and renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  Ultraviolet regime in quantum theory with horizons, contrary to ordinary
theory, depends on the temperature of the system due to additional surface
divergences in the effective action. We evaluate their general one-loop
structure paying attention to effects of the curvature of the space-time near
the horizon. In particular, apart from the area term, the entropy of a black
hole is shown to acquire a topological correction in the form of the integral
curvature of the horizon. To get the entropy, heat capacity and other
thermodynamical quantities finite, such a kind of singularities should be
removed by renormalization of a number of constants in a surface functional
introduced in the effective action at arbitrary temperature. We also discuss a
discrepancy in the different regularization techniques.
