Separation of variables and the XXZ Gaudin magnet
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we generalise previous results connecting (rational) Gaudin
magnet models and classical separation of variables. It is shown that the
connection persists for the case of linear r-matrix algebra which corresponds
to the trigonometric 4x4 r-matrix (of the XXZ type). We comment also on the
corresponding problem for the elliptic (XYZ) r-matrix. A prescription for
obtaining integrable systems associated with multiple poles of an L-operator is
given.
