Universal scheme of minimal reduction of usual and dual N=1,D=10
  supergravity to the Minkowsky space
</title>

<abstract>
  The reduction from N=1, D=10 to N=4, D=4 supergravity with the Yang-Mills
matter is considered. For this purpose a set of constraints is imposed in order
to exclude six additional abelian matter multiplets and conserve the
supersymmetry. We consider both the cases of usual and dual N=1, D=10
supergravity using the superspace approach. Also the effective potential of the
deriving theory is written.
