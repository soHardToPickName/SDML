A smooth massless limit for supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse in detail the behaviour of supersymmetric QCD with a number of
flavours M smaller than the number of colours N, for quark masses smaller than
the dynamically generated scale. In this regime, we find it useful to move from
meson superfields to Nambu-Goldstone-like variables. In particular we work out
the mass spectrum and the set of decay constants that specify the interactions
of the low-energy theory. We explicitly check that masses and decay constants
have a consistent behaviour under decoupling and that they satisfy current
algebra requirements. Finally we speculate about the massless limit. For
vanishing quark masses, and only in this case, the relation between mesons and
Nambu-Goldstone variables becomes singular. When analysed in terms of the
Nambu-Goldstone superfields, the massless limit exhibits a spontaneous breaking
of the flavour symmetry, with massless Goldstone modes embedded in an
M^2-dimensional complex moduli space. The symmetry-breaking order parameter is
formally infinite, but this has the only effect of turning off the interactions
between the chiral superfields.
