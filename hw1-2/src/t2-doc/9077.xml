Massive Yang-Mills Theory in Abelian Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the perturbative renormalisability of pure SU(2) Yang-Mills theory
in the abelian gauge supplemented with mass terms. Whereas mass terms for the
gauge fields charged under the diagonal U(1) allow to preserve the standard
form of the Slavnov-Taylor identities (but with modified BRST variations), mass
terms for the diagonal gauge fields require the study of modified
Slavnov-Taylor identities. We comment on the renormalization group equations,
which describe the variation of the effective action with the different masses.
Finite renormalized masses for the charged gauge fields, in the limit of
vanishing bare mass terms, are possible provided a certain combination of wave
function renormalization constants vanishes sufficiently rapidly in the
infrared limit.
