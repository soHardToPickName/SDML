Spacetime Structures and Physical Theories

<abstract>
  General relativity is applied to the strong interaction; the nexus between
the two being arrived at by constructing a line element having the Yukawa form,
which is used to describe geometrically the classical dynamics of a particle
moving under the influence of the short-range strong interaction. It is shown
that, with reasonable assumptions, the theory of general relativity can be made
compatible with quantum mechanics by using the general relativistic field
equations to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a quantum particle. The
resulting line element of the particle can be transformed entirely to that of a
Minkowski spacetime, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a
Minkowski observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. It is also discussed
the physical aspects of the affine connection in general relativity and its
relationship with the field strength of the electromagnetic field and strong
interaction. A heuristic geometric formulation of the electromagnetic field as
an independent spacetime structure is presented.
