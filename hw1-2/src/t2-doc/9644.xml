A Class of Anomaly-Free Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on a detailed calculation of the anomaly coefficients for the odd
and even parts of the $Z_2$-graded representation $\theta$ of the Lie algebra
Lie$ G$ on the exterior algebra of dimension $2^n$ assuming that $G\subset
U(n)$. The coefficients vanish provided $G\subset SU(n)$ and $n\ne3$. The
singular role of the gauge group SU(3) is emphasized.
  The Standard Model is covered by this result.
