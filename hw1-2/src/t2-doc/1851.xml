Differential Geometrical Formulation of Gauge Theory of Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity is
studied in this paper. The quantum gauge theory of gravity which is proposed in
the references hep-th/0109145 and hep-th/0112062 is formulated completely in
the framework of traditional quantum field theory. In order to study the
relationship between quantum gauge theory of gravity and traditional quantum
gravity which is formulated in curved space, it is important to find the
differential geometric formulation of quantum gauge theory of gravity. We first
give out the correspondence between quantum gauge theory of gravity and
differential geometry. Then we give out differential geometric formulation of
quantum gauge theory of gravity.
