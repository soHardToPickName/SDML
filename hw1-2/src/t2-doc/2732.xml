Decoupled path integral formulation of chiral QCD$_2$ with $a_{JR}=2$
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the BRST constraints and corresponding Hilbert-space structure of
chiral QCD$_2$ in the decoupled formulation for the case of the
Jackiw-Rajaraman parameter $a=2$. We show that despite formal similarities this
theory is not equivalent to QCD$_2$, and that its extension to U(N) does not
lead to an infinite vacuum degeneracy.
