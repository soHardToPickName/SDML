On the equivalence between the unified and standard versions of
  constraint dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of physical operators and states of the unified constraint
dynamics is studied. The genuine second--class constraints encoded are shown to
be the superselection operators. The unified constrained dynamics is
established to be physically--equivalent to the standard BFV--formalism with
constraints split.
