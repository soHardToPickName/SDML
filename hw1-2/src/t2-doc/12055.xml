Quasiparticle operators with non-Abelian braiding statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the gauge invariant fermions in the fermion coset representation of
$SU(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten models which create, by construction, the physical
excitations (quasiparticles) of the theory. We show that they provide an
explicit holomorphic factorization of $SU(N)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten primaries
and satisfy non-Abelian braiding relations.
