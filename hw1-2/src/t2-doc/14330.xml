Integer- and Non-Integer-Shift of the Chern-Simons Coupling under a
  Local Higher Covariant Derivative Regulator
</title>

<abstract>
  The Chern-Simons coupling shift is calculated within the framework of the
hybrid regularization based on a local higher covariant derivative regulator.
When the Yang-Mills term is present in the theory the well-know integer-shift
is obtained, but is absent, the shift value is non-integer. These results show
a possibility that a non-integer-shift can be derived using a local higher
covariant derivative and also suggest that the Yang-Mills term plays an
important role in the integer-shift of the Chern-Simons coupling.
