Gravitational energy, dS/CFT correspondence and cosmic no-hair
</title>

<abstract>
  The gravitational energy is examined in asymptotically de Sitter space-times.
The positivity will be shown for certain cases. The de Sitter/CFT(dS/CFT)
correspondence recently proposed and cosmic no-hair conjecture are testified in
the aspect of the gravitational energy. From the holographic renormalization
group point of view, the two conjectures are deeply connected with each other.
