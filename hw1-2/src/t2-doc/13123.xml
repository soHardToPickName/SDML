Mesons in the massive Schwinger model on the light-cone
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate mesons in the bosonized massive Schwinger model in the
light-front Tamm-Dancoff approximation in the strong coupling region. We
confirm that the three-meson bound state has a few percent fermion six-body
component in the strong coupling region when expressed in terms of fermion
variables, consistent with our previous calculations. We also discuss some
qualitative features of the three-meson bound state based on the information
about the wave function.
