Macroscopic and Microscopic Entropy of Near-Extremal Spinning Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A seven parameter family of five-dimensional black hole solutions depending
on mass, two angular momenta, three charges and the asymptotic value of a
scalar field is constructed. The entropy is computed as a function of these
parameters both from the Bekenstein-Hawking formula and from the degeneracies
of the corresponding D-brane states in string theory. The expressions agree at
and to leading order away from extremality.
