Higher-Order Differential Operators on a Lie Group and Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  This talk is devoted mainly to the concept of higher-order polarization on a
group, which is introduced in the framework of a Group Approach to
Quantization, as a powerful tool to guarantee the irreducibility of
quantizations and/or representations of Lie groups in those anomalous cases
where the Kostant-Kirilov co-adjoint method or the Borel-Weyl-Bott
representation algorithm do not succeed.
