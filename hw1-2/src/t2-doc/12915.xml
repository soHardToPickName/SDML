Attractors and Arithmetic
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider attractor varieties arising in the construction of dyonic black
holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of IIB string theory. We show that the
attractor varieties are constructed from products of elliptic curves with
complex multiplication for $\CN=4,8$ compactifications. The heterotic dual
theories are related to rational conformal field theories. The emergence of
curves with complex multiplication suggests many interesting connections
between arithmetic and string theory. This paper is a brief overview of a
longer companion paper entitled ``Arithmetic and Attractors.''
