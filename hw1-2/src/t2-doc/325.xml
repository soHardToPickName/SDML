Half-whole Dimensions in Quaternionic Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce {\em half-whole} dimensions for quaternionic matrices and
propose a quaternionic version of the Frobenius-Schur theorem which allows us
to obtain the proper quaternionic dimensionality for the representations of the
Dirac and Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau (DKP) algebras.
