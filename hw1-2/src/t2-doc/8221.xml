On Nonabelian Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that nonabelian duality is not a symmetry of a conformal field
theory, but rather a symmetry between different theories. We expose a nonlocal
symmetry of nonabelian dual theories. We show how, in the case with vanishing
isotropy, it can be used to find the inverse dual transformation. Finally, we
consider a number of new examples.
