Sp(2)-Symmetric Lagrangian BRST Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  One Lagrangian BRST quantization principle is that of imposing correct
Schwinger-Dyson equations through the BRST Ward identities. In this paper we
show how to derive the analogous $Sp(2)$-symmetric quantization condition in
flat coordinates from an underlying $Sp(2)$-symmetric Schwinger-Dyson BRST
symmetry. We also show under what conditions this can be recast in the language
of triplectic quantization.
