New Constraints on the Yukawa-Type Hypothetical Interaction From The
  Recent Casimir Force Measurement
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the constraints on the constants of hypothetical long-range
interactions which follow from the recent measurement of the Casimir force. A
comparison with previous constraints is given. The new constraints are up to a
factor of 3000 stronger in some parameter regions .
