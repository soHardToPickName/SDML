Topological Representations of $U_q(sl_2)$ on the Torus and the Mapping
  Class Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the mapping class group action on cycles on the configuration
space of the torus with one puncture, with coefficients in a local system
arising in conformal field theory. This action commutes with the topological
action of the quantum group $U_q(sl_2)$, and is given in vertex form.
