Regularized overlap and the chiral determinant
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relationship between the continuum overlap and its corresponding
chiral determinant, showing that the former amounts to an unregularised version
of the latter. We then construct a regularised continuum overlap, and consider
the chiral anomalies that follow therefrom. The relation between these
anomalies and the ones derived from the formal (i.e., unregularised) overlap is
elucidated.
