Domain Walls with Strings Attached
</title>

<abstract>
  We have constructed a bulk & brane action of IIA theory which describes a
pair of BPS domain walls on S_1/Z_2, with strings attached. The walls are given
by two orientifold O8-planes with coincident D8-branes and `F1-D0'-strings are
stretched between the walls. This static configuration satisfies all matching
conditions for the string and domain wall sources and has 1/4 of unbroken
supersymmetry.
