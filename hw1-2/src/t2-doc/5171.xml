Cosmological Solutions of Supergravity in Singular Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study brane-world solutions of five-dimensional supergravity in singular
spaces. We exhibit a self-tuned four-dimensional cosmological constant when
five-dimensional supergravity is broken by an arbitrary tension on the
brane-world. The brane-world metric is of the FRW type corresponding to a
cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda}={5/7}$ and an equation of state
$\omega=-{5/7}$ which are consistent with experiment.
