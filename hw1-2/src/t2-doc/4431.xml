On the Finiteness of the N=4 SUSY Nonlinear Sigma Model in Three
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the {\cal N}=4 supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model in three
dimensions which can be expanded in 1/N. We evaluate the effective action at
leading order in the 1/N expansion and show the finiteness of the model to this
order.
