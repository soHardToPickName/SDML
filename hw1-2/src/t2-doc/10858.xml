Brane-World and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the brane-world in the holographic point of view. Bearing the
realistic models in mind, the bulk massless scalar field is introduced. First
of all, we find the constraint on the coupling of the scalar fields with the
matter(not holographic CFT) on the brane. We show that the traceless part of
the energy-momentum tensor of holographic CFT is a part of the bulk Weyl
tensor. The trace part which comes from the trace-anomaly is corresponding to
the $\rho^2$-term appeared in the generalized FRW equation in the brane-world.
