Z_n-Graded Topological Generalizations of Supersymmetry and Orthofermion
  Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We review various generalizations of supersymmetry and discuss their
relationship. In particular, we show how supersymmetry, parasupersymmetry,
fractional supersymmetry, orthosupersymmetry, and the Z_n-graded topological
symmetries are related.
