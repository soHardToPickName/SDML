General Static N=2 Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find general static BPS black hole solutions for general N=2, d=4
supergravity theories with an arbitrary number of vector multiplets. These
solutions are completely specified by the K\"ahler potential of the underlying
special K\"ahler geometry and a set of constrained harmonic functions.
