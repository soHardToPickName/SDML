Symmetries of the Chern-Simons Theory in the Axial Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The Green functions of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gauge
are shown to be calculable as the unique, exact solution of the Ward identities
which express the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry
of Delduc, Gieres and Sorella.
