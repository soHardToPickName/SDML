On the Classical $W_{4}^{(2)}$ Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the classical \w42 algebra from the integrable system viewpoint.
The integrable evolution equations associated with the \w42 algebra are
constructed and the Miura maps , consequently modifications, are presented.
Modifying the Miura maps, we give a free field realization the classical \w42
algebra. We also construct the Toda type integrable systems for it.
