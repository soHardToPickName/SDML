Topological Chern-Simons vortices in the $O(3) \sigma$-model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a (2+1)-dimensional gauged $O(3) \sigma$-model with an Abelian
Chern--Simons term. It shows topologically stable, anyonic vortices as
classical solutions. The fields are studied in the case of rotational symmetry
and analytic approximations are found for their asymptotic behaviour. The
static Euler--Lagrange equations are solved numerically, where particular
attention is paid to the dependence of the vortex' properties on the coupling
to the gauge field. We compute the vortex mass and charge as a function of this
coupling and obtain bound states for two--vortices as well as two--vortices
with masses above the stability threshold.
