Spacetime supersymmetry in $AdS_3$ backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct string target spacetimes with AdS_3 x X geometry, which have an
N=2 spacetime superconformal algebra. X is found to be a U(1) fibration over a
manifold which is a target for an N=2 worldsheet conformal field theory. We
emphasize theories with free field realizations where in principle it is
possible to compute the full one-particle string spectrum.
