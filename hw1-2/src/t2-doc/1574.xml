Fermionic fields in the d-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Arbitrary spin free massless fermionic fields corresponding to mixed symmetry
representations of the \hbox{$SO(d-1)$} compact group and propagating in even
$d$-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime are investigated. Free wave equations
of motion, subsidiary conditions and the corresponding gauge transformations
for such fields are proposed. The lowest eigenvalues of the energy operator for
the massless fields and the gauge parameter fields are derived. The results are
formulated in $SO(d-1,2)$ covariant form as well as in terms of intrinsic
coordinates.
