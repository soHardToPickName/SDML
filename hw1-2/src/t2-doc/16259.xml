On the Existence of Undistorted Progressive Waves (UPWs) of Arbitrary
  Speeds $0 \leq v< \infty$ in Nature
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the theory, the experimental evidence, and fundamental physical
consequences concerning the existence of families of undistorted progressive
waves (UPWs) of arbitrary speeds $0\leq v < \infty$, which are solutions of the
homogeneous wave equation, Maxwell equations, and Dirac and Weyl equations.
