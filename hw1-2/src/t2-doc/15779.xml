On The Universality Class Of Little String Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that Little String Theories in six dimensions are quasilocal
quantum field theories. Such field theories obey a modification of Wightman
axioms which allows Wightman functions (i.e. vacuum expectation values of
products of fundamental fields) to grow exponentially in momentum space.
Wightman functions of quasilocal fields in x-space violate microlocality at
short distances. With additional assumptions about the ultraviolet behavior of
quasilocal fields, one can define approximately local observables associated to
big enough compact regions. The minimum size of such a region can be
interpreted as the minimum distance which observables can probe. We argue that
for Little String Theories this distance is of order {\sqrt N}/M_s.
