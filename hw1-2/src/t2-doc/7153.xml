Elliptic solution for modified tetrahedron equations
</title>

<abstract>
  As is known, tetrahedron equations lead to the commuting family of
transfer-matrices and provide the integrability of corresponding
three-dimensional lattice models. We present the modified version of these
equations which give the commuting family of more complicated two-layer
transfer-matrices. In the static limit we have succeeded in constructing the
solution of these equations in terms of elliptic functions.
