Dynamics of Anti-de Sitter Domain Walls
</title>

<abstract>
  We study solutions corresponding to moving domain walls in the
Randall-Sundrum universe. The bulk geometry is given by patching together black
hole solutions in AdS$_5$, and the motion of the wall is determined from the
junction equations. Observers on the wall interpret the motion as cosmological
expansion or contraction. We describe the possible wall trajectories, and
examine the consequences for localized gravity on the wall.
