Solitons and Domain Walls in Odd Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the existance of smooth soliton solutions which interpolate
between supersymmetric vacua in odd-dimensional theories. In particular we
apply this analysis to a wide class of supergravities to argue against the
existence of smooth domain walls interpolating between supersymmetric vacua. We
find that if the superpotential changes sign then any Goldstino modes will
diverge.
