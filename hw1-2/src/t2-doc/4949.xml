Topological Yang-Mills cohomology in pure Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the first order formalism (BFYM) of the Yang-Mills theory we show that
it displays an embedded topological sector corresponding to the field content
of the Topological Yang-Mills theory (TYM). This picture arises after a proper
redefinition of the fields of BFYM and gives a clear representation of the non
perturbative part of the theory in terms of the topological sector. In this
setting the calculation of the $vev$ of a YM observable is translated into the
calculation of a corresponding (non topological) quantity in TYM. We then
compare the topological observables of TYM with a similar set of observables
for BFYM and discuss the possibility of describing topological observables in
YM theory.
