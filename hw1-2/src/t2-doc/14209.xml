Ghosts as Negative Spinors
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the the properties of a BRST ghost degree of freedom complementary
to a two-state spinor. We show that the ghost may be regarded as a unit carrier
of negative entropy. We construct an irreducible representation of the su(2)
Lie algebra with negative spin, equal to -1/2, on the ghost state space and
discuss the representation of finite SU(2) group elements. The Casimir operator
J^2 of the combined spinor-ghost system is nilpotent and coincides with the
BRST operator Q. Using this, we discuss the sense in which the positive and
negative spin representations cancel in the product to give an effectively
trivial representation. We compute an effective dimension, equal to 1/2, and
character for the ghost representation and argue that these are consistent with
this cancellation.
