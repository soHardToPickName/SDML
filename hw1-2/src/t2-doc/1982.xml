p-Adic and Adelic Free Relativistic Particle
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider spectral problem for a free relativistic particle in p-adic and
adelic quantum mechanics. In particular, we found p-adic and adelic
eigenfunctions. Within adelic approach there exist quantum states that exhibit
discrete structure of spacetime at the Planck scale.
