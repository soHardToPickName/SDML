Gauge connection between the WZNW system and 2D induced gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a consistent gauge extension of the SL(2,R) WZNW system, defined
by a difference of two simple WZNW actions. By integrating out some dynamical
variables in the functional integral, we show that the resulting effective
theory coincides with the induced gravity in 2D. General solutions of both
theories are found and related to each other.
