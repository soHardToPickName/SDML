The factorization method, self-similar potentials and quantum algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a brief review of the Schrodinger's factorization method and its
relations to supersymmetric quantum mechanics and its nonlinear
(parastatistical, etc) modifications, self-similar infinite soliton potentials,
quantum algebras, coherent states, Ising chains, discretized random matrices
and 2D lattice Coulomb gases.
