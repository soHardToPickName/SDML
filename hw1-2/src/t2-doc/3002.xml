Connections between M-theory and superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  This article reviews the non-perturbative structure of certain higher
derivative terms in the type II string theory effective action and their
connection to one-loop effects in eleven-dimensional supergravity compactified
on a torus. New material is also included that was not presented in the talks.
