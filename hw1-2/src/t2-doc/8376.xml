Progress in Higher Spin Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  General properties of the theory of higher spin gauge fields in $AdS_4$ are
discussed. Some new results on the 4d conformal higher spin gauge theory are
announced. Talk given at the International Conference "Quantization, Gauge
Theory and Strings" in memory of E.S.Fradkin, Moscow, June 5-10, 2000.
