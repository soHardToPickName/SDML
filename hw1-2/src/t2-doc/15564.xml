Triple Intersections and Geometric Transitions
</title>

<abstract>
  The local neighborhood of a triple intersection of fivebranes in type IIA
string theory is shown to be equivalent to type IIB string theory on a
noncompact Calabi-Yau fourfold. The phases and the effective theory of the
intersection are analyzed in detail.
