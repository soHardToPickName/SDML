Non-BPS D-branes and enhanced symmetry in an asymmetric orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper properties of D branes in a nine dimensional asymmetric
orbifold are discussed, using a $(-1)^{F_L}\sigma_{1/2}$ projection, where
$F_L$ is the leftmoving space-time fermion number and $\sigma_{1/2}$ is a
freely acting shift of order two. There are two types of non BPS D branes,
which are stable at $R>2$ and $R<2$ respectively. At R=2 there is a
perturbative enhancement of gauge symmetry and the two types of branes are
related by a global bulk symmetry transformation. At this point in the moduli
space the associated boundary states are constructed using a free fermion
representation of the theory. Some aspects of the enhancement of gauge symmetry
in the S-dual type $\tilde I$ theory are discussed.
