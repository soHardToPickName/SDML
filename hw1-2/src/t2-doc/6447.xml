The Quantum Double in Integrable Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Various aspects of recent works on affine quantum group symmetry of
integrable 2d quantum field theory are reviewed and further clarified. A
geometrical meaning is given to the quantum double, and other properties of
quantum groups. Multiplicative presentations of the Yangian double are
analyzed.
