Quantization of Chern-Simons Coefficient
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between the Dirac quantization condition of magnetic charge and
the quantization of the Chern-Simons coefficient is obtained. It implies that
in a (2+1)-dimensional QED with the Chern-Simons topological mass term and the
existence of a magnetic monopole with magnetic charge $g$, the Chern-Simons
coefficient must be also quantized, just as in the non-Abelian case.
