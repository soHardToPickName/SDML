Stable non-BPS D-branes and their classical description
</title>

<abstract>
  We review how to describe the stable non-BPS D-branes of type II string
theory from a classical perspective, and discuss the properties of the
space-time geometry associated to these configurations. This is relevant in
order to see whether and how the gauge/gravity correspondence can be formulated
in non-conformal and non-supersymmetric settings.
