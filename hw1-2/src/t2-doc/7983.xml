Near-Extremal Spherically Symmetric Black Holes in an
  Arbitrary-Dimensional Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper (hep-th/0111091), the near-extremal thermodynamics of a
4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black hole had been considered. In the current
letter, we extend this prior treatment to the more general case of a
spherically symmetric, charged black hole of arbitrary dimensionality. After
summarizing the earlier work, we demonstrate a duality that exists between the
near-extremal sector of spherically symmetric black holes and Jackiw-Teitelboim
theory. On the basis of this correspondence, we argue that back-reaction
effects prohibit any of these ``RN-like'' black holes from reaching extremality
and, moreover, from coming arbitrarily close to an extremal state.
