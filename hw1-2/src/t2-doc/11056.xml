Global Conformal Invariance in D-dimensions and Logarithmic Correlation
  Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We define transformation of multiplets of fields (Jordan cells) under the
D-dimensional conformal group, and calculate two and three point functions of
fields, which show logarithmic behaviour. We also show how by a formal
differentiation procedure, one can obtain n-point function of logarithmic field
theory from those of ordinary conformal field theory.
