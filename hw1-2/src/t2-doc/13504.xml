Introduction to Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Even the uninitiated will know that Quantum Field Theory cannot be introduced
systematically in just four lectures. I try to give a reasonably connected
outline of part of it, from second quantization to the path-integral technique
in Euclidean space, where there is an immediate connection with the rules for
Feynman diagrams and the partition function of Statistical Mechanics.
