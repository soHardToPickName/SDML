On Supersymmetry Breaking in String Theory and its Realization in Brane
  Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We use string duality to describe instanton induced spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking in string compactifications with additional background fields.
Dynamical supersymmetry breaking by space-time instantons in the heterotic
string theory is mapped to a tree level breaking in the type II string which
can be explicitly calculated by geometric methods. It is argued that the
instanton corrections resurrect the no-go theorem on partial supersymmetry
breaking. The point particle limit describes the non-perturbative scalar
potential of a SYM theory localized on a hypersurface of space-time. The N=0
vacuum displays condensation of magnetic monopoles and confinement. The
supersymmetry breaking scale is determined by $M_{str}$, which can be in the
TeV range, and the geometry transverse to the gauge theory.
