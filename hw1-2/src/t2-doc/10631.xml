A Yang-Mills Theory in Loop Space and Generalized Chapline-Manton
  Coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a Yang-Mills theory in loop space with an affine Lie gauge group.
The Chapline-Manton coupling, the coupling between Yang-Mills fields and an
abelian antisymmetric tensor field of second rank via the Chern-Simons term, is
systematically derived within the framework of the Yang-Mills theory. The
generalized Chapline-Manton couplings, the couplings among non-abelian tensor
fields of second rank, Yang-Mills fields, and an abelian tensor field of third
rank, are also derived by applying the non-linear realization method to the
Yang-Mills theory. These couplings are accompanied by {\it BF}-like terms.
