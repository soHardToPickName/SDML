Inverse scattering and solitons in $A_{n-1}$ affine Toda field theories
  II
</title>

<abstract>
  New single soliton solutions to the affine Toda field theories are
constructed, exhibiting previously unobserved topological charges. This goes
some of the way in filling the weights of the fundamental representations, but
nevertheless holes in the representations remain. We use the group doublecross
product form of the inverse scattering method, and restrict ourselves to the
rank one solutions.
