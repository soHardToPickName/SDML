Quantization of the Particle Motion on the $n$-Dimensional Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop here a simple formalism that converts the second-class constraints
into first-class ones for a particle moving on the $n$-dimensional sphere. The
Poisson algebra generated by the Hamiltonian and the constraints closes and by
quantization transforms into a Lie algebra. The observable of the theory is
given by the Casimir operator of this algebra and coincides with the square of
the angular momentum.
