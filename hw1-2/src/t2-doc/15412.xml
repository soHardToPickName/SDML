Gauge fixing, co-BRST and time evolution in QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider BRST-invariant inner product states for quantum electrodynamics
constructed from trivial BRST-invariant states and a gauge regulator. The
trivial states are products of matter and ghost states and are annihilated by
hermitian operators. The co-BRST operator and some further gauge-fixing
regulators are found. The relation between gauge fixing and time evolution of
both the trivial and the inner product states is discussed.
