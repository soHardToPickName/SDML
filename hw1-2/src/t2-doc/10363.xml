Notes about equivalence between Sine-Gordon theory (free fermion point)
  and the free fermion theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The space of local integrals of motion for the Sine-Gordon theory (the free
fermion point) and the theory of free fermions in the light cone coordinates is
investigated. Some important differences between the spaces of local integrals
of motion of these theories are obtained. The equivalence is broken on the
level of the integrals of motion between bosonic and fermionic theories (in the
free fermion point). The integrals of motion are constracted without Quantum
Inverse Scattering Method (QISM)and the additional quantum integrals of motion
are obtaned. So the QISM is not absolutely complete.
