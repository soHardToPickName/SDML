On Self-dual Gravity Structures on Ground Ring Manifolds in
  Two-Dimensional String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the geometric structures generated by Witten's ground ring. It
is shown that these generalized structures involve in a natural way some
geometric constructions from Self-dual gravity [1,12]. The formal twistor
construction on full quantum ground ring manifold is also given.
