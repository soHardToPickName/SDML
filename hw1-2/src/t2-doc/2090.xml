Comments on Central Charge of Topological Sigma Model with Calabi-Yau
  Target Space

<abstract>
  We study a central charge Z of a one parameter family of Calabi-Yau d-fold
embedded in CP^{d+1}. For a d-fold case, we construct the Z concretely and
analyze charge vectors of D-branes and intersection forms of associated cycles.
We find the charges are described as some kinds of Mukai vectors. They are
represented as products of Chern characters of coherent sheaves restricted on
the Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces and square roots of A-roof genera of the d-folds.
By combining results of the topological sigma model and the data of the CFT
calculations in the Gepner model, we find that the Z is determined and is
specified by a set of integers. It labels boundary states in special classes
where associated states are represented as tensor products of boundary states
for constituent minimal models. The Z has a moduli parameter t that describes a
deformation of a moduli space in the open string channel with B-type boundary
conditions. Also monodromy matrices and homology cycles are investigated.
