F theory Vacua in Four Dimensions and Toric Threefolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate D=4, N=1 F theory models realized by type IIB string
compactification on toric threefolds. Massless spectra, gauge symmetries, phase
transitions associated with divisor contractions and flops, and
non-perturbative superpotentials are analyzed using elementary toric methods.
