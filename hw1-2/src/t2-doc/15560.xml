Quantum Corrections in p-adic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute loop corrections in p-adic open string field theory. We argue that
quantum effects induce a pole with m^2 ~ - ln g for the open string field at
the locally stable vacuum. We also compute the one loop effective potential and
show that the potential develops an imaginary piece when the field becomes
tachyonic.
