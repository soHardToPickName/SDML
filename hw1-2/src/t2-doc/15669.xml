Equivalence of the Beta-function of the Variational Approach to that of
  QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The variational ansatz for the ground state wavefunctional of QCD is found to
capture the anti-screening behaviour that contributes the dominant `-4' to the
beta-function and leads to asymptotic freedom. By considering an SU(N) purely
gauge theory in the Hamiltonian formalism and choosing the Coulomb gauge, the
origins of all screening and anti-screening contributions in gluon processes
are found in terms of the physical degrees of freedom. The overwhelming anti-
screening contribution of `-4' is seen to originate in the renormalisation of a
Coulomb interaction by a transverse gluon. The lesser screening contribution of
`1/3' is seen to originate in processes involving transverse gluon
interactions. It is thus apparent how the variational ansatz must be developed
to capture the full running of the QCD coupling constant.
