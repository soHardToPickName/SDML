Evidence for Large N Phase Transition in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory at
  Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence provides valuable constraints on the possible
exact form of various physical quantities in the ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theory in the large N limit. We examine the free energy as the expansions in a
small as well as in a large 't Hooft parameter $\lambda$. We argue that it is
impossible to smoothly extrapolate from the weak coupling regime to the strong
coupling regime, thus there must exist a large N phase transition in $\lambda$
at a finite temperature. We also argue that there is no world-sheet instanton
in the background of the Euclidean anti-de Sitter black hole.
