Substructure of String
</title>

<abstract>
  I review work developing the idea that string is a composite of point-like
entities called string bits. Old and new insights this picture brings into the
nature of string theory are discussed. This paper summarizes my talk presented
to the Strings96 conference at Santa Barbara, CA, 14-20 July 1996.
