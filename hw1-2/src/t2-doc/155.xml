Virasoro Algebra and O(N) Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of a local expansion of the logarithm of the O(N)
sigma-model vacuum functional, valid for slowly varying fields, the modified
Virasoro algebra is studied. The operator-like central charge term is given, up
to second order, for a general functional.
