Chiral Gauge Anomalies on Noncommutative Minkowski Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral gauge anomalies on noncommutative Minkowski Space-time are computed
and have their origin elucidated. The consistent form and the covariant form of
the anomaly are obtained. Both Fujikawa's method and Feynman diagram techniques
are used to carry out the calculations
