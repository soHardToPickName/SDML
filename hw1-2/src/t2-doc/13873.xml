Polarization of Instantons and Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravity can arise in a conventional non-Abelian gauge theory in which a
specific phenomenon takes place. Suppose there is a condensation of polarized
instantons and antiinstantons in the vacuum state. Then the excitations of the
gauge field in the classical approximation are described through the variables
of Riemann geometry satisfying the Einstein equations of general relativity.
There are no dimensional coupling constants in the theory.
