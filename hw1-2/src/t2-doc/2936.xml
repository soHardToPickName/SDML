Affine Toda Solitons and Automorphisms of Dynkin Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  Using Hirota's method, solitons are constructed for affine Toda field
theories based on the simply-laced affine algebras. By considering
automorphisms of the simply-laced Dynkin diagrams, solutions to the remaining
algebras, twisted as well as untwisted, are deduced.
