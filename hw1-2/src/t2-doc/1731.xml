String theory dualities from M theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze how string theory dualities may be described in M theory. T
dualities arise from scalar-vector dualities in the worldvolume of the membrane
of M theory. ``Electric-magnetic'' dualities arise from a duality
transformation in M theory compactified on a 3-torus, which takes the membrane
into a fivebrane wrapped around the 3-torus.
