Temporal-gauge String Field with Open Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A string field theory including open string fields is constructed in the
temporal gauge. It consists of string interaction vertices similar to the
light-cone gauge string field theory. A slight modification of the definition
of the time coordinate is needed because of the existence of the open string
end points.
