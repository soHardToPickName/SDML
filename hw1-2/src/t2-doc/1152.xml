Dynamics of the Universal Confining String Theory on the Loop Space

<abstract>
  Starting with the representation of the Wilson average in the Euclidean 4D
compact QED as a partition function of the Universal Confining String Theory,
we derive for it the corresponding loop equation, alternative to the familiar
one.
 In the functional momentum representation the obtained equation decouples into
two independent ones, which describe the dynamics of the transverse and
longitudinal components of the area derivative of the Wilson loop. At some
critical value of the momentum discontinuity, which can be determined from a
certain equation, the transverse component does not propagate.
 Next, we derive the equation for the momentum Wilson loop, where on the
left-hand side stands the sum of the squares of the momentum discontinuities,
multiplied by the loop, which describes its free propagation, while the
right-hand side describes the interaction of the loop with the functional
vorticity tensor current.
 Finally, using the method of inversion of the functional Laplacian, we obtain
for the Wilson loop in the coordinate representation a simple Volterra type-II
linear integral equation, which can be treated perturbatively.
