The Large-$N$ Limit of the Two-Hermitian-matrix model by the hidden BRST
  method
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper discusses the large N limit of the two-Hermitian-matrix model in
zero dimensions, using the hidden BRST method. A system of integral equations
previously found is solved, showing that it contained the exact solution of the
model in leading order of large $N$.
