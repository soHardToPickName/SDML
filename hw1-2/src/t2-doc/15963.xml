Lagrangian Formulation of the Joos-Weinberg's 2(2S+1)-- theory and Its
  Connection with the Skew-Symmetric Tensor Description
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of the $2(2S+1)$-- theory of Joos-Weinberg for massless
particles, the dynamical invariants have been derived from the Lagrangian
density which is considered to be a 4-- vector. A l\'a Majorana interpretation
of the 6-- component spinors, the field operators of $S=1$ particles, as the
left-- and right--circularly polarized radiation, leads us to the conserved
quantities which are analogous to ones obtained by Lipkin and Sudbery. The
scalar Lagrangian of Joos-Weinberg theory is shown to be equivalent to the
Lagrangian of a free massless field, introduced by Hayashi. As a consequence of
a new "gauge" invariance this skew-symmetric field describes physical particles
with the longitudinal components only.
