Some mathematical considerations about generalized Yang-Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalized Yang-Mills theories are constructed, that can use fields other
than vector as gauge fields. Their geometric interpretation is studied. An
application to the Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model is briefly review, and some
related mathematical and physical considerations are made.
