Comment on 'Another form of the Klein-Gordon equation'
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the alternative Klein-Gordon equation with positive definite
probability density proposed in a letter by M.D. Kostin does not meet the
requirements of relativistic (quantum) field theory and therefore does not
allow for a meaningful physical interpretation.
