A speculative remark on holography
</title>

<abstract>
  Holography suggests a considerable reduction of degrees of freedom in
theories with gravity. However it seems to be difficult to understand how
holography could be realized in a closed re--contracting universe. In this
letter we claim that a scenario which achieves that goal will eliminate all
spatial degrees of freedom. This would require a different concept of quantum
mechanics and would imply an intriguing increase of power for the natural laws.
