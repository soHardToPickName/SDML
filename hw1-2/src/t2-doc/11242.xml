Solution of the Scalar Coulomb Bethe-Salpeter Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  A relativistic two-body wave equation, local in configuration space, is
derived from the Bethe-Salpeter equation for two scalar particles bound by a
scalar Coulomb interaction. The two-body bound-state wave equation is solved
analytically, giving a two-body Bohr-Sommerfeld formula whose energies agree
with the Bethe-Salpeter equation to order alpha^4 for all quantum states. From
the Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, along with the expectation values of two remaining
small corrections, the energy levels of the scalar Coulomb Bethe-Salpeter
equation are worked out to order alpha^6 for all states.
