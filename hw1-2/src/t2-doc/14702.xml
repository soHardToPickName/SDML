  On an equation associated with the contact Lie algebras/ Mikhail V. Saveliev/
In the framework of a Lie algebraic approach we study a nonlinear equation
associated with the contact Lie algebra ${\bf K}K_m$, that seems to be relavant
for some solvable models of field theory and gravity in higher dimensions.
