Induced Variational Method from Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the
  Screened Coulomb Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  The formalism of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics supplies a trial wave
function to be used in the Variational Method. The screened Coulomb potential
is analysed within this approach. Numerical and exact results for energy
eigenvalues are compared.
