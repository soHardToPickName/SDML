Effective action for QED_4 through zeta function regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain, through zeta function methods, the one-loop effective action for
massive Dirac fields in the presence of a uniform, but otherwise general,
electromagnetic background. After discussing renormalization, we compare our
zeta function result with Schwinger's proper time approach.
