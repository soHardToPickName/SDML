Hagedorn Behaviour of Little String Theory from String Corrections to
  NS5-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the conjectured duality between near-horizon NS5-branes and little
string theory, the string-corrected thermodynamics of near-horizon NS5-branes
is studied and found to agree with the statistical thermodynamics of a 5+1
dimensional supersymmetric string theory near the Hagedorn temperature.
Specifically, tree-level corrections to the temperature are argued to vanish,
in accordance with the duality, while the one-loop string correction to the
NS5-brane thermodynamics is shown to generate the correct temperature
dependence of the entropy.
