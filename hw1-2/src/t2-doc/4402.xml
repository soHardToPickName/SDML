The Functional Measure of Gauge Theories in the Presence of Gribov
  Horizons
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the formal structure of a functional measure for Gauge Theories
preserving the Slavnov-Taylor identity in the presence of Gribov horizons. Our
construction defines a gauge-fixed measure in the framework of the lattice
regularization by dividing the configuration space into patches with different
gauge-fixing prescriptions. Taking into account the bounds described by
Dell'Antonio and Zwanziger we discuss the behaviour of the measure in the
continuum limit for finite space-time volume.
