Scale Invariance in a Non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Matter Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The general method of reduction in the number of coupling parameters is
applied in a Chern-Simons-matter model with several independent couplings. We
claim that considering the asymptotic region, and expressing all dimensionless
coupling parameters as functions of the Chern-Simons coupling, it is possible
to show that all $\beta$-functions vanish to any order of perturbative series.
Therefore, the model is asymptotically scale invariant.
