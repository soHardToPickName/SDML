Instantons and SL(2,R) Symmetry in Type IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation between the dual formulations of Type IIB
supergravity emphasizing the differences between Lorentz and Euclidean
signature. We demonstrate how the SL(2,R) symmetry of the usual action is
manifested in the solution of the equations of motion with Euclidean signature
for the dual theory.
