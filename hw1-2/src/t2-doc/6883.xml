The light-cone gauge without prescriptions
</title>

<abstract>
  Feynman integrals in the physical light-cone gauge are harder to solve than
their covariant counterparts. The difficulty is associated with the presence of
unphysical singularities due to the inherent residual gauge freedom in the
intermediate boson propagators constrained within this gauge choice. In order
to circumvent these non-physical singularities, the headlong approach has
always been to call for mathematical devices --- prescriptions --- some
successful ones and others not so much so. A more elegant approach is to
consider the propagator from its physical point of view, that is, an object
obeying basic principles such as causality. Once this fact is realized and
carefully taken into account, the crutch of prescriptions can be avoided
altogether. An alternative third approach, which for practical computations
could dispense with prescriptions as well as prescinding the necessity of
careful stepwise watching out of causality would be of great advantage. And
this third option is realizable within the context of negative dimensions, or
as it has been coined, negative dimensional integration method, NDIM for short.
