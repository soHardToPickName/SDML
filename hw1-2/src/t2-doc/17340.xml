Non-singular solutions of flux branes in M-theory and attractor
  solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  Here we present a class of solutions of M-theory flux branes, which are
non-singular at origin. These class of solutions help us to determine the field
strength at origin together with the behavior of it near origin. Further we
show a way to find the attractor solutions of such flux branes.
