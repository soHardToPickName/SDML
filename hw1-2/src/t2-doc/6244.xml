The Local Structure of Anomaly Inflow
</title>

<abstract>
  Anomaly cancellation for M-theory fivebranes requires the introduction of a
"bump-form" which smoothes out the five-brane source. We discuss the physical
origin of this bump-form in the simpler case of axion strings in 3+1 dimensions
and construct it in terms of the radial profile of the fermion zero modes. Our
treatment allows for a clearer understanding of the role played by covariant
rather than consistent anomalies when anomalies are canceled by inflow from the
bulk. We briefly discuss the generalization of these results to fivebrane
anomalies in M theory.
