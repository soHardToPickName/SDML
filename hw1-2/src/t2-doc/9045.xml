BPS Solitons in M5-Brane Worldvolume Theory with Constant Three-Form
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS solutions for a self-dual string and a neutral string in
M5-brane worldvolume theory with constant three-form field. We further
generalize such solitons to superpose with a calibrated surface. We also study
a traveling wave on a calibrated surface in the constant three-form field
background.
