Dynamical Topology Change in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact string solutions are presented, providing backgrounds where a dynamical
change of topology is occuring. This is induced by the time variation of a
modulus field. Some lessons are drawn concerning the region of validity of
effective theories and how they can be glued together, using stringy
information in the region where the topology changes.
