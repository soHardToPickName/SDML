  constraints

  To every partition $n=n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_s$ one can associate a vertex operator
realization of the Lie algebras $a_{\infty}$ and $\hat{gl}_n$. Using this
construction we obtain reductions of the $s$--component KP hierarchy,
reductions which are related to these partitions. In this way we obtain matrix
KdV type equations. We show that the following two constraints on a KP
$\tau$--function are equivalent (1) $\tau$ is a $\tau$--function of the
$[n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_s]$--th reduced KP hierarchy which satisfies string
equation, $L_{-1}\tau=0$, (2) $\tau$ satisfies the vacuum constraints of the
$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra. Talk given at the V International Conference on
