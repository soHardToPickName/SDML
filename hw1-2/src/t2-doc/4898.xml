Towards a unified description of the four interactions in terms of
  Dirac-Bergmann observables
</title>

<abstract>
  A review is given of the status and developments of the research program
aiming to reformulate the physics of the four interactions at the classical
level in a unified way in terms of Dirac-Bergmann observables with special
emphasis on the open mathematical, physical and interpretational problems.
