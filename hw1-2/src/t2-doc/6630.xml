Goldstone Theorem in the Gaussian Functional Approximation to the Scalar
  $\phi^{4}$ Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We verify the Goldstone theorem in the Gaussian functional approximation to
the $\phi^{4}$ theory with internal O(2) symmetry. We do so by reformulating
the Gaussian approximation in terms of Schwinger-Dyson equations from which an
explicit demonstration of the Goldstone theorem follows directly.
