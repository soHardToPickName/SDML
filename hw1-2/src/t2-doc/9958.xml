$R^2$ Gravity in $(2+\epsilon)$--Dimensional Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $R^2$ gravity in $(2+\epsilon)$--dimensional quantum gravity. Taking
care of the oversubtraction problem in the conformal mode dynamics, we perform
a full order calculation of string susceptibility in the $\epsilon \rightarrow
0$ limit. The result is consistent with that obtained through Liouville
approach.
