A formula for the static potential energy in quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a general expression for the static potential energy of the
gravitational interaction of two massive particles, in terms of an invariant
vacuum expectation value of the quantized gravitational field. This formula
holds for functional integral formulations of euclidean quantum gravity,
regularized to avoid conformal instability. It could be regarded as the
analogue of the Wilson loop for gauge theories and allows in principle, through
numerical simulations or other approximation techniques, non perturbative
evaluations of the potential or of the effective coupling constant. The
geometrical meaning of this expression is quite simple, as it represents the
``average proper-time delay'', respect to two neighboring lines, of a very long
geodesic with unit timelike tangent vector.
