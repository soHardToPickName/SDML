Spin generalization of the Calogero-Moser system and the Matrix KP
  equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The complete solutions of the spin generalization of the elliptic Calogero
Moser systems are constructed. They are expressed in terms of Riemann
theta-functions. The analoguous constructions for the trigonometric and
rational cases are also presented.
