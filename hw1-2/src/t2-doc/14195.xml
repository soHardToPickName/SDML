Construction of bosons and fermions out of quons
</title>

<abstract>
  The quon algebra describes particles, ``quons,'' that are neither fermions
nor bosons, using a label $q$ that parametrizes a smooth interpolation between
bosons ($q = 1$) and fermions ($q = -1$). Understanding the relation of quons
on the one side and bosons or fermions on the other can shed light on the
different properties of these two kinds of operators and the statistics which
they carry. In particular, local bilinear observables can be constructed from
bosons and fermions, but not from quons. In this paper we construct bosons and
fermions from quon operators. For bosons, our construction works for $-1 \leq q
\leq 1$. The case $q=-1$ is paradoxical, since that case makes a boson out of
fermions, which would seem to be impossible. None the less, when the limit $q
\to -1$ is taken from above, the construction works. For fermions, the
analogous construction works for $-1 \leq q \leq 1$, which includes the
paradoxical case $q=1$.
