The BV-algebra structure of W_3 cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize some recent results obtained in collaboration with J. McCarthy
on the spectrum of physical states in $W_3$ gravity coupled to $c=2$ matter. We
show that the space of physical states, defined as a semi-infinite (or BRST)
cohomology of the $W_3$ algebra, carries the structure of a BV-algebra. This
BV-algebra has a quotient which is isomorphic to the BV-algebra of polyvector
fields on the base affine space of $SL(3,C)$. Details have appeared elsewhere.
