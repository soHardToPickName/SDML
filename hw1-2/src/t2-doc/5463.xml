On Non-Abelian Structure From Matrix Coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the matrix quantum mechanics of N D0-branes in the background of
the 1-form RR field. It is observed that the transformations of matrix
coordinates of D0-branes induce on the Abelian RR field symmetry
transformations that are like those of non-Abelian gauge fields. The
Lorentz-like equations of motion for matrix coordinates are derived. The field
strengths appearing in the Lorentz-like equations transform in the adjoint
representation of U(N) under symmetry transformations. A possible relation
between D0-brane dynamics in RR background, and the semi-classical dynamics of
charged particles in Yang-Mills background is mentioned.
