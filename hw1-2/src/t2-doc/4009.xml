Chronology Protection in Generalized Godel Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action of a free scalar field propagating in the generalized
Godel spacetime is evaluated by the zeta-function regularization method. From
the result we show that the renormalized stress energy tensor may be divergent
at the chronology horizon. This gives a support to the chronology protection
conjecture.
