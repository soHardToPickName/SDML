Photon as the magnetic monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we reinvestigate photon. We show that photon can be identified
with the Dirac magnetic monopole. We give a model of quantum electrodynamics
from which we derive photon as a quantum loop of this model. This nonlinear
loop model of photon is exactly solvable and thus may be regarded as a quantum
soliton. From the winding numbers of this loop model of photon we derive the
quantization property of energy of Planck's formula of radiation and the
quantization property of electric charge. We show that these two quantizations
are just the same quantization when photon is identified with the magnetic
monopole. From this nonlinear model of photon we also construct a model of
electron which has a mass mechanism for generating mass to electron.
