Comment on Dirac spectral sum rules for QCD_3
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently Magnea hep-th/9907096 , hep-th/9912207 [Phys.Rev.D61, 056005 (2000);
Phys.Rev.D62, 016005 (2000)] claimed to have computed the first sum rules for
Dirac operators in 3D gauge theories from 0D non-linear sigma models. I point
out that these computations are incorrect, and that they contradict with the
exact results for the spectral densities unambiguously derived from random
matrix theory by Nagao and myself.
