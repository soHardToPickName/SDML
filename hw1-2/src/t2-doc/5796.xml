Fibrewise T-Duality for D-Branes on Elliptic Calabi-Yau
</title>

<abstract>
  Fibrewise T-duality (Fourier-Mukai transform) for D-branes on an elliptic
Calabi-Yau $X$ is shown to require naturally an appropriate twisting of the
operation respectively a twisted charge. The fibrewise T-duality is furthermore
expressed through known monodromies in the context of Kontsevich's
interpretation of mirror symmetry.
