Some Issues related to Conformal Anomaly Induced Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Some issues related to quantum anomaly induced effects due to matter are
considered. Explicit examples corresponding to quantum creation of d4 dilatonic
AdS Universe and of d2 dilatonic AdS Black Hole (BH) are discussed. Motivated
by holographic RG, in a similar approach, it is shown that, starting from a 5
dimensional AdS Universe, 4-dimensional de Sitter or AdS world is generated on
the boundary of such Universe as a result of quantum effects. A 5-dimensional
brane-world cosmological scenario is also considered, where the brane tension
is not longer a free parameter, but its role is taken by quantum effects
induced by the 4-dimensional conformal anomaly associated with conformal
coupled matter. As a result, consistent quantum creations of De Sitter or AdS
curved branes are possible.
