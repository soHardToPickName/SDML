N=1 and N=2 Super Yang-Mills theories from wrapped branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider supergravity solutions of D5 branes wrapped on supersymmetric
2-cycles and use them to discuss relevant features of four-dimensional N=1 and
N=2 super Yang-Mills theories with gauge group SU(n). In particular in the N=1
case, using a gravitational dual of the gaugino condensate, we obtain the
complete NSVZ beta-function. We also find non-perturbative corrections
associated to fractional instantons with charge 2/n. These non-perturbative
effects modify the running of the coupling constant which remains finite even
at small scales in a way that resembles to the soft confinement scenario of
QCD.
