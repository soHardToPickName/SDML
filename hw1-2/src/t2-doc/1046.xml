Quantum Clifford-Hopf Algebras for Even Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the quantum Clifford-Hopf algebras $\widehat{CH_q(D)}$
for even dimensions $D$ and obtain their intertwiner $R-$matrices, which are
elliptic solutions to the Yang- Baxter equation. In the trigonometric limit of
these new algebras we find the possibility to connect with extended
supersymmetry. We also analyze the corresponding spin chain hamiltonian, which
leads to Suzuki's generalized $XY$ model.
