Fermion Emission from Five-Dimensional Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate semiclassically the emission rate of spin 1/2 particles from
charged, nonrotating black holes in D=5,N=8 supergravity. The relevant Dirac
equation is solved by the same approximation as in the bosonic case. The
resulting expression for the emission rate has a form which is predicted from
D-brane effective field theory.
