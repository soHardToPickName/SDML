Universal Ratios in the 2-D Tricritical Ising Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the universality class of the two-dimensional Tricritical Ising
Model. The scaling form of the free-energy naturally leads to the definition of
universal ratios of critical amplitudes which may have experimental relevance.
We compute these universal ratios by a combined use of results coming from
Perturbed Conformal Field Theory, Integrable Quantum Field Theory and numerical
methods.
