Spinor Exchange in AdS_{d+1}
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly calculate a Witten diagram with general spinor field exchange
on $(d+1)$-dimensional Euclidean Anti-de Sitter space, which is necessary to
evaluate four-point correlation functions with spinor fields when we make use
of the AdS/CFT correspondence, especially in supersymmetric cases. We also show
that the amplitude can be reduced to a scalar exchange amplitude. We discuss
the operator product expansion of the dual conformal field theory by
interpreting the short distance expansion of the amplitude according to the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
