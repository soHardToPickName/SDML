Generalized Dynamics of Two Distict BPS Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical and quantum dynamics of two distinct BPS monopoles in the case of
non-aligned Higgs fields are studied on the basis of the recently determined
low energy effective theory. Despite the presence of a specific potential
together with a kinetic term provided by the metric of a Taub-NUT manifold, an
O(4) or O(3,1) symmetry of the system allows for a group theoretical derivation
of the bound-state spectrum and the scattering cross section.
