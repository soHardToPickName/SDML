Functional integration on two dimensional Regge geometries

<abstract>
  By adopting the standard definition of diffeomorphisms for a Regge surface we
give an exact expression of the Liouville action both for the sphere and the
torus topology in the discretized case. The results are obtained in a general
way by choosing the unique self--adjoint extension of the Lichnerowicz operator
satisfying the Riemann--Roch relation. We also give the explicit form of the
integration measure for the conformal factor. For the sphere topology the
theory is exactly invariant under the $SL(2,C)$ transformations, while for the
torus topology we have exact translational and modular invariance. In the
continuum limit the results flow into the well known expressions.
