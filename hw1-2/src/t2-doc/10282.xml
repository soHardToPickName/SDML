On Path Integration on Noncommutative Geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a recent approach to quantum field theoretical path integration on
noncommutative geometries which imply UV/IR regularising finite minimal
uncertainties in positions and/or momenta. One class of such noncommutative
geometries arise as `momentum spaces' over curved spaces, for which we can now
give the full set of commutation relations in coordinate free form, based on
the Synge world function.
