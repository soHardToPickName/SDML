From A_m Trigonometric S-Matrices to the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz equations that have been proposed to describe
massive integrable deformations of the coset conformal field theories
$g_k\times g_l/g_{k+l}$ are shown to result directly by applying the usual
thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz arguments to the trigonometric $S$-matrices for the
algebras $g=a_{m-1}$.
