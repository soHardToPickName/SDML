Uniqueness of the Seiberg-Witten Effective Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  The low energy effective Lagrangian for $N\es 2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory, proposed by Seiberg and Witten is shown to be the unique solution,
assuming only that supersymmetry is unbroken and that the number of
strong-coupling singularities is finite. Duality is then a consequence rather
than an input.
