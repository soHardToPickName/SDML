Topological Quantum Field Theory and Seiberg-Witten Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  A topological quantum field theory is introduced which reproduces the
Seiberg-Witten invariants of four-manifolds. Dimensional reduction of this
topological field theory leads to a new one in three dimensions. Its partition
function yields a three-manifold invariant, which can be regarded as the
Seiberg-Witten version of Casson's invariant. A Geometrical interpretation of
the three dimensional quantum field theory is also given.
