Four-dimensional QCD and fiberwise duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We transform, by means of a fiberwise duality, the partition function of QCD
on a product of two two-tori, into a four-dimensional sigma-model, whose target
space is the cotangent space of unitary connections on the fiber torus
fiberwise.
