Solitons in Brane Worlds II
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the solution describing a non-extreme dilatonic (p+1)-brane
intersecting a D-dimensional extreme dilatonic domain wall, where one of its
longitudinal directions is along the direction transverse to the domain wall,
in relation to the Randall-Sundrum type model. The dynamics of the probe
(p+1)-brane in such source background reproduces that of the probe p-brane in
the background of the (D-1)-dimensional source p-brane. However, as for a probe
test particle, the dynamics in one lower dimensions is reproduced, only when
the source (p+1)-brane is uncharged.
