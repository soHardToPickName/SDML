Moduli Space Cohomology and Wavefunctions in 3D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Wavefunctionals of three dimensional quantum gravity are extracted from the
3D field theoretic analogs of the four dimensional Donaldson polynomials. Our
procedure is generalizable to four and other dimensions. This is a summary of a
talk presented at the Seventh Marcel Grossmann Meeting on General Relativity,
Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, July 24 - 30, 1994
