Nonpertubative Effects of Extreme Localization in Noncommutative
  Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  ``Extremely'' localized wavefunctions in noncommutative geometry have
disturbances that are localized to distances smaller than $\sqrt{\theta}$,
where $\theta$ is the ``area'' parameter that measures noncommutativity. In
particular, distributions such as the sign function or the Dirac delta function
are limiting cases of extremely localized wavefunctions. It is shown that Moyal
star products of extremely localized wavefunctions cannot be correctly computed
perturbatively in powers of $\theta$. Nonperturbative effects as a function of
$\theta$ are explicitly displayed through exact computations in several
examples. In particular, for distributions, star products end up being
functions of $\theta ^{-1}$ and have no expansion in positive powers of
$\theta$. This result provides a warning for computations in noncommutative
space that often are performed with perturbative methods. Furthermore, the
result may have interesting applications that could help elucidate the role of
noncommutative geometry in several areas of physics.
