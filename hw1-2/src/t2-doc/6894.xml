A Note on the String Analog of $N=2$ Super-Symmetric Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  A connection between the conifold locus of the type II string on the
$W\:P_{11226}^4$ Calabi-Yau manifold and the geometry of the quantum moduli of
$N = 2$ $SU(2)$ super Yang-Mills is presented. This relation is obtained from
the anomalous behaviour of the $SU(2)$ super Yang-Mills special coordinates
under $S$-duality transformation in $Sl(2;Z) / \Gamma_2$.
