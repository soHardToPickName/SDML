The Improved Bounce Solution of SU(2)-Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We further develop the reduced action formalism of the SU(2)-Higgs model
originally given by Aoyama et.al.. Our new ansatz for the sphaleron solution
makes it possible to apply this formalism to all range of the Higgs self
coupling constant. Based on the formalism, we construct a bounce solution
oscillating around the sphaleron.
