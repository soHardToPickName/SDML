Geometrical Interpretation of BRST Symmetry in Topological
  Yang-Mills-Higgs Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study topological Yang-Mills-Higgs theories in two and three dimensions
and topological Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions in a unified framework of
superconnections. In this framework, we first show that a classical action of
topological Yang-Mills type can provide all three classical actions of these
theories via appropriate projections. Then we obtain the BRST and anti-BRST
transformation rules encompassing these three topological theories from an
extended definition of curvature and a geometrical requirement of Bianchi
identity. This is an extension of Perry and Teo's work in the topological
Yang-Mills case. Finally, comparing this result with our previous treatment in
which we used the ``modified horizontality condition", we provide a meaning of
Bianchi identity from the BRST symmetry viewpoint and thus interpret the BRST
symmetry in a geometrical setting.
