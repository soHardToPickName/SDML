Generalized N=2 Supersymmetric Toda Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we introduce a class of generalized supersymmetric Toda field
theories. The theories are labeled by a continuous parameter and have $N=2$
supersymmetry. They include previously known $N=2$ Toda theories as special
cases. Using the WZNW -->Toda reduction approach we obtain a closed
expression for the bracket of the associated ${\cal W}$ algebras. We also
derive an expression for the generators of the ${\cal W}$ algebra in a free
superfield realization.
