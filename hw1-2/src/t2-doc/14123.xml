Construction of Non-critical String Field Theory by Transfer Matrix
  Formalism in Dynamical Triangulation
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new method which analyzes the dynamical triangulation from the
viewpoint of the non-critical string field theory. By using the transfer matrix
formalism, we construct the non-critical string field theory (including $c>1$
cases) at the discrete level. For pure quantum gravity, we succeed in taking
the continuum limit and obtain the $c=0$ non-critical string field theory at
the continuous level. We also study about the universality of the non-critical
string field theory.
