The Unstable System in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  A soluble model for the relativistically description of an unstable system is
given in terms of relativistic quantum field theory, with a structure similar
to Van Hove's generalization of the Lee model in the non-relativistic theory.
