One-loop effective action for Einstein gravity in special background
  gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective action for Einstein gravity in a special one-parameter
background gauge is calculated up to first order in a gauge parameter. It is
shown that the effective action does not depend upon the gauge parameter on
shell.
