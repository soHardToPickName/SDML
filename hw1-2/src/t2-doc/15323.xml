A brief guide to p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the qualitative properties of p-brane solutions of supergravity
theories and present two examples of p-brane solutions, first the dyonic
membrane solutions of N=2 D=8 supergravity and second the intersecting M-brane
solutions of D=11 supergravity.
