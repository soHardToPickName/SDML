QCD/String holographic mapping and glueball mass spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  We have recently found a one to one holographic mapping between QCD glueballs
and dilaton states in AdS space. This result leads to the appropriate scaling
of high energy glueball scattering amplitudes from low energy string theory.
Here we show that this mapping also gives a simple expression for the ratio of
scalar glueball masses.
