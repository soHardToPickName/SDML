Thermal ensemble of string gas in a magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the thermal ensemble of a gas of free strings in presence of a
magnetic field. We find that the thermodynamical partition function diverges
when the magnetic field exceeds some critical value $B_{\rm cr}$, which depends
on the temperature. We argue that there is a first-order phase transition with
a large latent heat. At the critical value an infinite number of states -all
states in a Regge trajectory- seem to become massless, which may be an
indication of recuperation of spontaneously broken symmetries.
