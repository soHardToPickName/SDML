A Generalization of the Casson Invariant
</title>

<abstract>
  A three dimensional supergravity theory which generalizes the super IG theory
of Witten and resembles the model discussed recently by Mann and Papadopoulos
is displayed. The partition function is computed, and is shown to be a
three-manifold invariant generalizing the Casson invariant.
