<abstract>
  This contribution to the proceedings of the 1999 NATO ASI on Quantum Geometry
at Akureyri, Iceland, is based on notes of lectures given by A. Strominger.
Topics include N-particle conformal quantum mechanics, extended superconformal
quantum mechanics and multi-black hole moduli spaces.
