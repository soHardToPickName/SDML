Probability Amplitudes for Charge-Monopole Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we quantize a previously proposed non-local lagrangean for the
classical dual electrodynamics (Phys.Lett.B 384(1996)197), showing how it can
be used to construct probability amplitudes. Our results are shown to agree
with those obtained in the context of Schwinger and Zwanzinger formulations,
but without necessity of introducing strings.
