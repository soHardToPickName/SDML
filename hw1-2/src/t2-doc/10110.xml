Can a Lattice String Have a Vanishing Cosmological Constant?
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that a class of one-loop partition functions found by Dienes, giving
rise to a vanishing cosmological constant to one-loop, cannot be realized by a
consistent lattice string. The construction of non-supersymmetric string with a
vanishing cosmological constant therefore remains as elusive as ever. We also
discuss a new test that any one-loop partition function for a lattice string
must satisfy.
