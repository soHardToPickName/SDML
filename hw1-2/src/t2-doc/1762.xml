Convergent sequences of perturbative approximations for the anharmonic
  oscillator I. Harmonic approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We present numerical evidence that a simple variational improvement of the
ordinary perturbation theory of the quantum anharmonic oscillator can give a
convergent sequence of approximations even in the extreme strong coupling
limit, the purely anharmonic case. Some of the new techniques of this paper can
be extended to renormalizable field theories.
