Quantum Stability of Accelerated Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study quantum aspects of the accelerated black holes in some detail.
Explicitly shown is the fact that a uniform acceleration stabilizes certain
charged black holes against the well-known thermal evaporation. Furthermore, a
close inspection of the geometry reveals that this is possible only for
near-extremal black holes and that most nonextremal varieties continue to
evaporate with a modified spectrum under the acceleration. We also introduce a
two-dimensional toy model where the energy-momentum flow is easily obtained for
general accelerations, and find the behavior to be in accordance with the
four-dimensional results. After a brief comparison to the classical system of a
uniformly accelerated charge, we close by pointing out the importance of this
result in the WKB expansion of the black hole pair-creation rate.
