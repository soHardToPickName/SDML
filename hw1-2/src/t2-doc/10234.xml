A new maximally supersymmetric background of IIB superstring theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a maximally supersymmetric IIB string background. The geometry is
that of a conformally flat lorentzian symmetric space G/K with solvable G, with
a homogeneous five-form flux. We give the explicit supergravity solution,
compute the isometries, the 32 Killing spinors, and the symmetry superalgebra,
and then discuss T-duality and the relation to M-theory.
