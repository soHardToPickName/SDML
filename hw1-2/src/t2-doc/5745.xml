Kabat's Surface Terms in the Zeta-Function approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermal partition functions of photons in any covariant gauge and
gravitons in the harmonic gauge, propagating in a Rindler wedge, are computed
using a local zeta-function approach. The relation with the surface terms
previously obtained by D. Kabat is studied. The results are discussed in
relation to the quantum corrections to the black hole entropy.
