Multi-boundary effects in Dirichlet String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
String amplitudes with an arbitrary number of world-sheet boundaries on which
the coordinates satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions are analyzed in a path
integral framework. Special attention is payed to the novel divergences
associated with such conditions. Certain helicity amplitudes involving massless
closed-string states are free of such divergences to all orders in perturbation
theory and their behavior can be analysed unambiguously. The high energy
fixed-angle behavior of these amplitudes is discussed in the presence of one or
two boundaries and the asymptotic behavior of the amplitudes is shown to be
power behaved.
