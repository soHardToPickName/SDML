Generalized Reduction Procedure: Symplectic and Poisson Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a generalized reduction procedure which encompasses the one based
on the momentum map and the projection method. By using the duality between
manifolds and ring of functions defined on them, we have cast our procedure in
an algebraic context. In this framework we give a simple example of reduction
in the non-commutative setting.
