Covariant Quantization Of Green Schwarz Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a canonical covariant approach to the quantization of the
Green-Schwarz superstring. The approach is first applied to the canonical
covariant quantization of the Brink and Schwarz superparticle. The Kallosh
action is obtained in this case, with the correct BRST cohomology.
