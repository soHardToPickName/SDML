The R-matrix structure of the Euler-Calogero-Moser model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the $r$-matrix for the generalization of the Calogero-Moser
system introduced by Gibbons and Hermsen. By reduction procedures we obtain the
$r$-matrix for the $O(N)$ Euler-Calogero-Moser model and for the standard $A_N$
Calogero-Moser model.
