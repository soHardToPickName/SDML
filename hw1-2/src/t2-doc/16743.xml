Non-perturbative Fermion Propagator for the Massless Quenched QED3
</title>

<abstract>
  For massless quenched QED in three dimensions, we evaluate a non-perturbative
expression for the fermion propagator which agrees with its two loop
perturbative expansion in the weak coupling regime. This calculation is carried
out by making use of the Landau-Khalatnikov-Fradkin transformations. Any
improved construction of the fermion-boson vertex must make sure that the
solution of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator reproduces
this result. For two different gauges, we plot the fermion propagator against
momentum. We then make a comparison with a similar plot, using the earlier
expression for the fermion propagator, which takes into account only the one
loop result.
