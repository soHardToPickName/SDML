Bogomolny Yang-Mills-Higgs Solutions in (2+1) anti-de Sitter Space
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper investigates an integrable system which is related to hyperbolic
monopoles; ie the Bogomolny Yang-Mills-Higgs equations in (2+1) anti-de Sitter
space which are integrable and whose solutions can be obtained using analytical
methods. In particular, families of soliton solutions have been constructed
explicitly and their dynamics has been investigated in some detail.
