Lorentz-Covariant Analysis of a Quantum Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  A set of integral relations for rotational and translational zero modes in
the vicinity of the classical soliton solution are derived from the
particle-like properties of the latter. The validity of these all relations is
considered for a number of soliton models in 2+1- and 3+1-dimensions.
