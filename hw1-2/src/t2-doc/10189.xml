Deconstructing de Sitter
</title>

<abstract>
  Semiclassical gravity predicts that de Sitter space has a finite entropy. We
suggest a picture for Euclidean de Sitter space in string theory, and use the
AdS/CFT correspondence to argue that de Sitter entropy can be understood as the
number of degrees of freedom in a quantum mechanical dual.
