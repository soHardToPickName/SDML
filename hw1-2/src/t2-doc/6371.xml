Soluble field theory with a massless gauge invariant limit
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that there exists a soluble four parameter model in (1+1)
dimensions all of whose propagators can be determined in terms of the
corresponding known propagators of the vector coupling theory. Unlike the
latter case, however, the limit of zero bare mass is nonsingular and yields a
nontrivial theory with a rigorously unbroken gauge invariance.
