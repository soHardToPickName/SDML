Exotic Quantum Double,Its Universal R-matrix And Their Representations
</title>

<abstract>
  The exotic quantum double and its universal R-matrix for quantum Yang-Baxter
equation are constructed in terms of Drinfeld's quantum double theory.As a new
quasi-triangular Hopf algebra, it is much different from those standard quantum
doubles that are the q-deformations for Lie algebras or Lie superalgebras. By
studying its representation theory,many-parameter representations of the exotic
quantum double are obtained with an explicit example associated with Lie
algebra $A_2$ .The multi-parameter R-matrices for the quantum Yang-Baxter
equation can result from the universal R-matrix of this exotic quantum double
and these representattions.
