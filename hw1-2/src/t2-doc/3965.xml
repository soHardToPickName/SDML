Covariant Phase Space Formulations of Superparticles and Supersymmetric
  WZW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new covariant phase space formulations of superparticles moving on
a group manifold, deriving the fundamental Poisson brackets and current
algebras. We show how these formulations naturally generalise to the
supersymmetric Wess-Zumino-Witten models.
