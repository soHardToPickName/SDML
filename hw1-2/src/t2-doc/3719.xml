An Extension of Type I Gaugeon Formalism for Quantum Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  By introducing two kinds of gaugeon fields, we extend Yokoyama's Type I
gaugeon formalism for quantum electrodynamics. The theory admits a q-number
gauge transformation by which we can shift the gauge parameter into arbitrary
numerical value; whereas in the original theory we cannot change the sign of
the parameter. The relation to the Type II theory is also discussed.
