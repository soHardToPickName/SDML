Quantisation and Gauge Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent developments concerning canonical quantisation and gauge invariant
quantum mechanical systems and quantum field theories are briefly discussed. On
the one hand, it is shown how diffeomorphic covariant representations of the
Heisenberg algebra over curved manifolds of non trivial topology involve
topology classes of flat U(1) bundles. On the other hand, through some
examples, the recently proposed physical projector approach to the quantisation
of general gauge invariant systems is shown to avoid the necessity of any gauge
fixing - hence also avoiding the possibility of Gribov problems which usually
ensue any gauge fixing procedure - and is also capable to provide the adequate
description of the physical content of gauge invariant systems.
