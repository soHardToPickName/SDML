Traveling Faster than the Speed of Light in Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study various dynamical aspects of solitons in non-commutative gauge
theories and find surprising results. Among them is the observation that the
solitons can travel faster than the speed of light for arbitrarily long
distances.
