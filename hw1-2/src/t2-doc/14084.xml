Vortex solution in 2+1 dimensional Yang-Mills theory at high
  temperatures
</title>

<abstract>
  At high temperatures the A_0 component of the Yang--Mills field plays the
role of the Higgs field, and the 1-loop potential V(A_0) plays the role of the
Higgs potential. We find a new stable vortex solution of the
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen type, and discuss its properties and possible
implications.
