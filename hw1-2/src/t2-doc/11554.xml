Prelogarithmic operators and Jordan blocks in SL(2)_k affine algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The free field description of logarithmic and prelogarithmic operators in non
compact Wess-Zumino-Witten model is analysed. We study the structure of the
Jordan blocks of the SL(2)_k affine algebra and the role of the puncture
operator in the theory in relation with the unitarity bound.
