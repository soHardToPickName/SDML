Chiral Interactions of Massive Particles in the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2)
  Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of the first principles we argue that self/anti-self charge
conjugate states of the (1/2,0)+(0,1/2) representation can possess the axial
charge. Finally, we briefly discuss recent claims of the \sim \vec \sigma \cdot
[ \vec A \times \vec A^\ast ] interaction term for the particles of this
representation.
