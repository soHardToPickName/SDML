N-Extended Local Supersymmetry of Massless Particles in Spaces of
  Constant Curvature
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the unified description of massless spinning particles, living in
spaces of constant curvature, in the framework of the pseudoclassical approach
with a gauged $N$-extended worldline supersymmetry and a local $O(N)$
invariance.
