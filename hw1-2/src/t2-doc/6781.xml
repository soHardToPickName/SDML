On the singular spectrum of the Almost Mathieu operator. Arithmetics and
  Cantor spectra of integrable models

  I review a recent progress towards solution of the Almost Mathieu equation
(A.G. Abanov, J.C. Talstra, P.B. Wiegmann, Nucl. Phys. B 525, 571, 1998), known
also as Harper's equation or Azbel-Hofstadter problem. The spectrum of this
equation is known to be a pure singular continuum with a rich hierarchical
structure. Few years ago it has been found that the almost Mathieu operator is
integrable. An asymptotic solution of this operator became possible due
analysis the Bethe Ansatz equations.
