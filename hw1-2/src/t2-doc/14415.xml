Local symmetries of the non-Abelian two-form
</title>

<abstract>
  It is proposed that a non-Abelian adjoint two-form in BF type theories
transform inhomogeneously under the gauge group. The resulting restrictions on
invariant actions are discussed. The auxiliary one-form which is required for
maintaining vector gauge symmetry transforms like a second gauge field, and
hence cannot be fully absorbed in the two-form. But it can be replaced, via a
vector gauge transformation, by the usual gauge field, leading to gauge
equivalences between different types of theories. A new type of symmetry also
appears, one which depends on local functions but cannot be generated by
constraints. It is connected to the identity in the limit of a vanishing global
parameter, so it should be called a semiglobal symmetry. The corresponding
conserved currents and BRST charges are parametrized by the space of flat
connections.
