The enhancon mechanism for fractional branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the enhancon mechanism for fractional D-branes in conifold and
orbifold backgrounds and show how it can resolve the repulson singularity of
these geometries. In particular we show that the consistency of the excision
process requires that the interior space be not empty. In the orbifold case, we
exploit the boundary state formalism to obtain an explicit conformal
description and emphasize the non trivial role of the volume of the internal
manifold.
