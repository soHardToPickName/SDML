A Note on ``Anomalous" Chiral Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, the lattice regularization of chiral gauge theories proposed by
Kaplan, when applied to a (2+1)-dimensional domain wall, produces a
(1+1)-dimensional theory at low energy even if gauge anomaly produced by chiral
fermions does not cancel. But the corresponding statement is not true in higher
dimensions.
