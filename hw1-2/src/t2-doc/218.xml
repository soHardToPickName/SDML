Vacuum Instability in Topologically Massive Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the critical charge for a topologically massive gauge theory for any
gauge group, generalising our earlier result for SU(2). The relation between
critical charges in TMGT, singular vectors in the WZNW model and logarithmic
CFT is investigated.
