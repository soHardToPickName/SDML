Antisymmetric Tensor Fields in the Locally Localized Gravity Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the localization property of antisymmetric tensor fields in the
locally localized gravity models. It is shown that all the antisymmetric tensor
fields, including the vector field, in a bulk space-time are trapped on an
$AdS$ brane by a gravitational interaction where the presence of the brane
cosmological constant plays an important role as in the cases of the other bulk
fields. The normalized zero-modes spread rather widely in extra space so small
extra dimensions might be needed in order not to conflict with experiment.
