Geometrical formulation for the Siegel superparticle}
</title>

<abstract>
  In the superspace $z^M = (x^\mu,\theta_R,\theta_L)$ the global symmetries for
$d$ = 10 superparticle model with kinetic terms both for Bose and Fermi
variables are shown to form a superalgebra, which includes the Poincar\'e
superalgebra as a subalgebra. The subalgebra is realized in the space of
variables of the theory by a nonstandard way. The local version of this model
with off-shell closed Lagrangian algebra of gauge symmetries and off-shell
global supersymmetry is presented. It is shown that the resulting model is
dynamically equivalent to the Siegel superparticle.
