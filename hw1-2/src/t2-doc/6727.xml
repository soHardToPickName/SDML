Quantum corrections to the mass of the supersymmetric vortex
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate quantum corrections to the mass of the vortex in N=2
supersymmetric abelian Higgs model in (2+1) dimensions. We put the system in a
box and apply the zeta function regularization. The boundary conditions
inevitably violate a part of the supersymmetries. Remaining supersymmetry is
however enough to ensure isospectrality of relevant operators in bosonic and
fermionic sectors. A non-zero correction to the mass of the vortex comes from
finite renormalization of couplings.
