Multiplet Structures of BPS Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  There exist simple single-charge and multi-charge BPS p-brane solutions in
the D-dimensional maximal supergravities. From these, one can fill out orbits
in the charge vector space by acting with the global symmetry groups. We give a
classification of these orbits, and the associated cosets that parameterise
them.
