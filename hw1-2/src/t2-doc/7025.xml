Quadratic brackets from symplectic forms

<abstract>
  We give a physicist oriented survey of Poisson-Lie symmetries of classical
systems. We consider finite dimensional geometric actions and the chiral WZNW
model as examples for the general construction. An essential point is that
quadratic Poisson bracets appear for group--like variables. It is believed that
after quantization they lead to quadratic exchange algebras.
