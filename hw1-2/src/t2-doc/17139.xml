Quasi-rational fusion products
</title>

<abstract>
  Fusion is defined for arbitrary lowest weight representations of
$W$-algebras, without assuming rationality. Explicit algorithms are given. A
category of quasirational representations is defined and shown to be stable
under fusion. Conjecturally, it may coincide with the category of
representations of finite quantum dimensions.
