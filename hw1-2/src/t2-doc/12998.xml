Yangian symmetry in the Non Linear Schrodinger hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Yangian symmetry of the multicomponent Quantum Nonlinear
Schrodinger hierarchy in the framework of the Quantum Inverse Scattering
Method. We give an explicit realization of the Yangian generators in terms of
the deformed oscillators algebra which naturally occurs in this framework.
