Semi-infinite cohomology in conformal field theory and 2d gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various techniques for computing the semi-infinite cohomology of
highest weight modules which arise in the BRST quantization of two dimensional
field theories. In particular, we concentrate on two such theories -- the $G/H$
coset models and $2d$ gravity coupled to $c\leq 1$ conformal matter. (to appear
in the proceedings of the XXV Karpacz Winter School)
