T-duality invariance in random lattice strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Preserving the T-duality invariance of the continuum string in its random
lattice regularization uniquely determines the random matrix model potential.
For D=0 the duality transformation can be performed explicitly on the matrix
action, and replaces color with flavor; invariance thus requires that the color
and flavor groups be the same.
