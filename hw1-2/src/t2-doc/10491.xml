BRS symmetry from renormalization group flow
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the exact renormalization group formulation we prove perturbatively
the Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identities in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory. This results
from two properties: {\it locality}, i.e. the ST identities are valid if their
local part is valid; {\it solvability}, i.e. the local part of ST identities is
valid if the couplings of the effective action with non-negative dimensions are
properly chosen.
