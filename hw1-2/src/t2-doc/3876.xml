Winding number transitions at finite temperature in the Abelian-Higgs
  model

<abstract>
  Following our earlier investigations we examine the quantum-classical winding
number transition in the Abelian-Higgs system. It is demonstrated that the
sphaleron transition in this system is of the smooth second order type in the
full range of parameter space. Comparison of the action of classical vortices
with that of the sphaleron supports our finding.
