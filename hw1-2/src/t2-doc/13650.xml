Counterterms in type I Supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the one-loop divergences of D=10, N=1 supergravity and of its
reduction to D=8. We study the tensor structure of the counterterms appearing
in D=8 and D=10 and compare these to expressions previously found in the low
energy expansion of string theory. The infinities have the primitive Yang-Mills
tree amplitude as a common factor.
