Symmetries of the Chern-Simons Theory in the Axial Gauge, Manifold with
  Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  The field equations of the Chern-Simons theory quantized in the axial gauge
are shown to be completely determined by supersymmetry Ward identities which
express the invariance of the theory under the topological supersymmetry of
Delduc, Gieres and Sorella together with the usual Slavnov identity without
requiring any action principle.
