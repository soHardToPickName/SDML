Type-I vacua from non-geometric Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Some examples of Type-I vacua related to non geometric orbifolds are shown.
In particular, the open descendants of the diagonal $Z_3$ orbifold are compared
with the geometric ones. Although not chiral, these models exhibit some
interesting properties, like twisted sectors in the open-string spectra and the
presence of ``quantized'' geometric moduli, a key ingredient to ensure their
perturbative consistency and to explain the rank reduction of their Chan-Paton
groups.
