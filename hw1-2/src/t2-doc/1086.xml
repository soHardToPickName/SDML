Calogero model, deformed oscillators and the collapse
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the behavior of the Calogero model and the related model of
deformed oscillators with the S_N extended Heisenberg algebra for a special
value of the constant of interaction/statistical parameter nu. The problem with
finite number of deformed oscillators is analyzed in the algebraic approach,
while collective-field theory has been used to investigate the large-N limit.
In this limit, system reduces to a large number of collapsing (free) particles,
for nu=-1/N.
