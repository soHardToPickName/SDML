Higgsed antisymmetric tensors and topological defects
</title>

<abstract>
  We find topological defect solutions to the equations of motion of a
generalised Higgs model with antisymmetric tensor fields. These solutions are
direct higher dimensional analogues of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex solution for a
gauge field in four dimensions.
