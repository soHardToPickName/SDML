Orbifold Compactifications with continuous Wilson lines
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify the untwisted moduli of heterotic orbifold compactifications for
the case, when the gauge twist is realized by a rotation. The Wilson lines are
found to have both continuous and discrete parts. For the case of the standard
Z(3) orbifold we classify all possibilities of breaking the gauge group E(6)
times SU(3) by nine of the eighteen Wilson moduli and by additional discrete
Wilson lines.
