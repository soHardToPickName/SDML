Nonclassical Light in Interferometric Measurements
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the even and odd coherent light and other nonclassical
states of light like superposition of coherent states with different phases may
replace the squeezed light in interferometric gravitational wave detector to
increase its sensitivity. (Contribution to the Second Workshop on Harmonic
