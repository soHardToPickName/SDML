On the free field realization of the osp(1|2) current algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The free field representation of the osp(1|2) current algebra is analyzed.
The four point conformal blocks of the theory are studied. The structure
constants for the product of an arbitrary primary operator and a primary field
that transforms according to the fundamental representation of osp(1|2) are
explicitly calculated.
