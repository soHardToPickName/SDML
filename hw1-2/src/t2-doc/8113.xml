Non-Local Pseudo-Differential Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We define, in a consistent way, non-local pseudo-differential operators
acting on a space of analytic functionals. These operators include the
fractional derivative case. In this context we show how to solve homogeneous
and inhomogeneous equations associated with these operators. We also extend the
formalism to d-dimensional space-time solving, in particular, the fractional
Wave and Klein-Gordon equations.
