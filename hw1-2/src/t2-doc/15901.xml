On Zero-Mass Ground States in Super-Membrane Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We recall a formulation of super-membrane theory in terms of certain matrix
models. These models are known to have a mass spectrum given by the positive
half-axis. We show that, for the simplest such matrix model, a normalizable
zero-mass ground state does not exist.
