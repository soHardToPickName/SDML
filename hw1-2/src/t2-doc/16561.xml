The Form Factors in the Sinh-Gordon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The most general solution to the form factor problem in the sinh-Gordon model
is presented in an explicit way. The linearly independent classes of solutions
correspond to powers of the elementary field. We show how the form factors of
exponential operators can be obtained from the general solution by adjusting
free parameters. The general formula obtained in the sinh-Gordon case
reproduces the form factors of the scaling Lee-Yang model in a certain limit of
the coupling constant.
