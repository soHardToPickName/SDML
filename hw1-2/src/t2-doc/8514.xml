Radiative Correction to the Casimir Force on a Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The first radiative correction to the Casimir energy of a perfectly
conducting spherical shell is calculated. The calculation is performed in the
framework of covariant perturbation theory with the boundary conditions
implemented as constraints. The formalism is briefly reviewed and its use is
explained by deriving the known results for two parallel planes.
  The ultraviolet divergencies are shown to have the same structure as those
for a massive field in zeroth order of $\alpha$. In the zeta-functional
regularization employed by us no divergencies appear.
  If the radius of the sphere is large compared to the Compton wavelength of
the electron the radiative correction is of order $\alpha/(R^2m_e)$ and
contains a logarithmic dependence on $m_eR$. It has the opposite sign but the
same order of magnitude as in the case of two parallel planes.
