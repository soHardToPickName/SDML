Coordinate-free derivation of Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons field equations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we derive in a coordinate-free manner the field equations for a
lagrangean consisting of Yang-Mills kinetical term plus Chern-Simons
self-coupling term. This equation turns out to be an eigenvalue equation for
the covariant laplacian.
