On the physical Hilbert space of QCD$_2$ in the decoupled formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the QCD$_2$ partition function in the non-local, decoupled
formulation and systematically establish which subset of the nilpotent Noether
charges is required to vanish on the physical states. The implications for the
Hilbert space structure are also examined.
