Holomorphy, Minimal Homotopy and the 4D, N = 1 Supersymmetric
  Bardeen-Gross-Jackiw Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  By use of a special homotopy operator, we present an explicit, closed-form
and simple expression for the left-right Bardeen-Gross-Jackiw anomalies
described as the proper superspace integral of a superfunction.
