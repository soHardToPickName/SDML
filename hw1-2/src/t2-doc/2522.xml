A Brane World Model with Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A brane world model is investigated, in which there are many branes that may
intersect and self intersect. One of the branes, being a 3-brane, represents
our spacetime, while the other branes, if they intersect our brane world,
manifest themselves as matter in our 3-brane. It is shown that such a matter
encompasses dust of point particles and higher dimensional p-branes, and all
those objects follow "geodesics" in the world volume swept by our 3-brane. We
also point point out that such a model can be formulated in a background
independent way, and that the kinetic term for gravity arises from quantum
fluctuation of the brane.
