Causal Perturbation Theory and Differential Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  In Causal Perturbation Theory the process of renormalization is precisely
equivalent to the extension of time ordered distributions to coincident points.
This is achieved by a modified Taylor subtraction on the corresponding test
functions. I show that the pullback of this operation to the distributions
yields expressions known from Differential Renormalization. The subtraction is
equivalent to BPHZ subtraction in momentum space. Some examples from Euclidean
scalar field theory in flat and curved spacetime will be presented.
