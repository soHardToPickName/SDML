On a Zero Curvature Representation for Bosonic Strings and $p$-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a zero curvature representation for $D$-- dimensional $p$--
brane equations of motion originates naturally in the geometric (Lund- Regge-
Omnes) approach. To study the possibility to use this zero curvature
representation for investigation of nonlinear equations of $p$-- branes, the
simplest case of $D$-- dimensional string ($p=1$) is considered. The connection
is found between the $SO(1,1)$ gauge (world--sheet Lorentz) invariance of the
string theory with a nontrivial dependence on a spectral parameter of the Lax
matrices associated with the nonlinear equations describing the embedding of a
string world sheet into flat $D$-- dimensional space -- time. Namely, the
spectral parameter can be identified with a parameter of constant $SO(1,1)$
gauge transformations, after the deformation of the Lax matrices has been
performed.
