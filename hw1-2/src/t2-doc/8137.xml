Raiders of the Lost AdS

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that under certain conditions a theory of conformal quantum
mechanics will exhibit the symmetries of two half-Virasoro algebras. We further
demonstrate the conditions under which these algebras combine to form a single
Virasoro algebra, and comment on the connection between this result and the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
