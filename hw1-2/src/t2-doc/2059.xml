On Gauge Invariance and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the widely used concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking can be
explained in causal perturbation theory by introducing a perturbative version
of quantum gauge invariance. Perturbative gauge invariance, formulated
exclusively by means of asymptotic fields, is discussed for the simple example
of Abelian U(1) gauge theory (Abelian Higgs model). Our findings are relevant
for the electroweak theory, as pointed out elsewhere.
