Irreducible Antifield Analysis of $p$-Form Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The irreducible antifield formalism for $p$-form gauge theories with gauge
invariant interaction terms is exposed. The ghosts of ghosts do not appear. The
acyclicity of the Koszul-Tate operator is ensured without introducing
antifields at resolution degrees higher that two.
