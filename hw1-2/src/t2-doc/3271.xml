Symmetries of 2-d Gravity

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional gravity in the light-cone gauge was shown to exhibit an
underlying sl(2,R) current algebra. It is the purpose of this note to offer
a possible explanation about the origin of this important algebra. The
essential point is that two-dimensional gravity is governed by a topological
field theory. The gauge group is sl(2,R) and it is this enhanced gauge group
that yields Polyakov's current algebra.
