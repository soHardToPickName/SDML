A Variational Calculation of Positronium in QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a reformulation of QED in which covariant Green functions are
used to solve for the electromagnetic field in terms of the fermion fields. The
resulting modified Hamiltonian contains the photon propagator directly. A
simple Fock-state variational trial function is used to derive relativistic
fermion-antifermion equations variationally from the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian of the field theory. The interaction kernel of the equations are
shown to involve the lowest order invariant M-matrices. The two-body
eigenenergies are shown to agree with known result for positronium-like systems
to order O(alpha ^4) in the coupling constant.
