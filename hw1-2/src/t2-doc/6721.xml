Gauge Theories Coupled to Fermions in Generation
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge theories coupled to fermions in generation are reformulated in a
modified version of extended differential geometry with the symbol $\chi$.
After discussing several toy models, we will reformulate in our framework the
standard model based on Connes' real structure. It is shown that for the most
general bosonic lagrangin which is required to also reconstruct N=2 super
Yang-Mills theory Higgs mechanism operates only for more than one generation as
first pointed out by Connes and Lott.
