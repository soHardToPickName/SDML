A Proposal for Strings at D>1
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the reduced formulation on large-N Quantum Field Theories we study
strings in space-time dimensions higher that one. We present results on
possible string susceptibilities, macroscopic loop operators, 1/N -corrections
and other general properties of the model.
