Generalized Wess-Zumino Consistency Conditions for Pure W_3 Gravity
  Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  General expressions for the anomalies appearing in pure W_3 gravity are found
by requiring that they satisfy a modified version of the Wess-Zumino
consistency conditions in which the Ward identities are treated as nonvanishing
quantities.
