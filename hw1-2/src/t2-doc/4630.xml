String theory in Lorentz-invariant light cone gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantization of 4-dimensional Nambu-Goto theory of open string in light cone
gauge, related in Lorentz-invariant way with the world sheet, is performed.
Obtained quantum theory has no anomalies in Lorentz group. Determined spin-mass
spectra of the theory have Regge-like behavior and do not contain the tachyon.
Vertex operators of interaction theory, acting in the physical subspace, are
constructed.
