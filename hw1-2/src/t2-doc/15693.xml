On the Baryonic Branch Root of N=2 MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the brane exchange in the framework of N=2 MQCD by using a
specific family of M fivebrane configurations relevant to describe the baryonic
branch root. An exchange of M fivebranes is realized in the Taub-NUT geometry
and controlled by the moduli parameter of the configurations. This family also
provides two different descriptions of the root. These descriptions are
examined carefully using the Taub-NUT geometry. It is shown that they have the
same baryonic branch and are shifted each other by the brane exchange.
