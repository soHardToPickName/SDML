Landau Levels in the noncommutative $AdS_2$
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the Landau problem in the context of the noncommutative analog
of a surface of constant negative curvature, that is $AdS_2$ surface, and
obtain the spectrum and contrast the same with the Landau levels one finds in
the case of the commutative $AdS_2$ space.
