Fixed point analysis of a scalar theory with an external field
</title>

<abstract>
  A momentum dependent projection of the Wegner-Hougton equation is derived for
a scalar theory coupled to an external field. This formalism is useful to
discuss the phase diagram of the theory. In particular we study some properties
of the Gaussian fixed point.
