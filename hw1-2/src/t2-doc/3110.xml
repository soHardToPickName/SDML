Compactification with Flux on K3 and Tori
</title>

<abstract>
  We study compactifications of Type IIB string theory on a K3 \times T^2/Z_2
orientifold in the presence of RR and NS flux. We find the most general
supersymmetry preserving, Poincare invariant, vacua in this model. All the
complex structure moduli and some of the Kahler moduli are stabilised in these
vacua. We obtain in an explicit fashion the restrictions imposed by
supersymmetry on the flux, and the values of the fixed moduli. Some T-duals and
Heterotic duals are also discussed, these are non-Calabi-Yau spaces. A
superpotential is constructed describing these duals. Finally, we consider some
susy breaking vacua where the flux gives rise to large extra dimensions with
vanishing tree-level cosmological constant.
