The Akulov-Volkov Lagrangian, Symmetry Currents and Spontaneously Broken
  Extended Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the Akulov-Volkov effective Lagrangian governing the self
interactions of the Nambu-Goldstone fermions associated with spontaneously
broken extended supersymmetry as well as their coupling to matter is presented
and scrutinized. The resulting currents associated with R-symmetry,
supersymmetry and space-time translations are constructed and seen to form a
supermultiplet structure.
