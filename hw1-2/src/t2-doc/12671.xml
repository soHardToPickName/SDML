Consequences of 't Hooft's Equivalence Class Theory and Symmetry by
  Large Coarse Graining
</title>

<abstract>
  According to 't Hooft (Class.Quantum.Grav. 16 (1999), 3263), quantum gravity
can be postulated as a dissipative deterministic system, where quantum states
at the ``atomic scale''can be understood as equivalence classes of primordial
states governed by a dissipative deterministic dynamics law at the ``Planck
scale''. In this paper, it is shown that for a quantum system to have an
underlying deterministic dissipative dynamics, the time variable should be
discrete if the continuity of its temporal evolution is required. Besides, the
underlying deterministic theory also imposes restrictions on the energy
spectrum of the quantum system. It is also found that quantum symmetry at the
``atomic scale'' can be induced from 't Hooft's Coarse Graining classification
of primordial states at the "Planck scale".
