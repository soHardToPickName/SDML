Open string field theory without open strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Witten's cubic open string field theory is expanded around the perturbatively
stable vacuum, including all scalar fields at levels 0, 2, 4 and 6. The
(approximate) BRST cohomology of the theory is computed, giving strong evidence
for the absence of physical open string states in this vacuum.
