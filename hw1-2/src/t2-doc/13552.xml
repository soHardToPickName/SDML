Overlap formulation of Majorana--Weyl fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  An overlap method for regularizing Majorana--Weyl fermions interacting with
gauge fields is presented. A mod(2) index is introduced in relation to the
anomalous violation of a discrete global chiral symmetry. Most of the paper is
restricted to 2 dimensions but generalizations to 2+8k dimensions should be
straightforward.
