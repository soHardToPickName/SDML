Geometrical Analysis of Brane Creation via M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometrical analysis is given of Dirichlet fourbrane creation, when
sixbrane crosses fivebrane in M-theory. A special property of the Taub-NUT
space leads to the consequence. When brane configurations are considered for
four dimensional N=2 field theories, sixbrane contributes to the beta-function
through the Dirac string of the Taub-NUT space.
