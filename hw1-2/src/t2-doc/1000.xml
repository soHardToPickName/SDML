Gaugino mass in the Heterotic string with Scherk-Schwarz
  compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  The generic observable sector gaugino mass in the weakly-coupled heterotic
string compactified to four dimensions by the Scherk-Schwarz scheme (together
with hidden sector gaugino condensation inducing the super-Higgs effect with a
vanishing cosmological constant) is shown to be non-zero at tree level, being
of the order of the gravitino mass, modulo reasonable assumptions regarding the
magnitude of the condensate and the Scherk-Schwarz mass parameters
