Comments on BPS Bound State Decay
</title>

<abstract>
  In N=2 SYM theory with matter non-conservation of the S-charge of a BPS state
under monodromies leads to so-called BPS state "decay". A mechanism for such a
behavior on the semiclassical level could be established through consideration
of soliton-fermion bound state. Solutions to classical equations of motion
allow to observe the BPS state "decay" in vivo.
