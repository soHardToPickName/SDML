Near Anti-de Sitter Geometry and Corrections to the Large N Wilson Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  Within recent Maldacena's proposal to relate gauge theories in the large N
limit to the supergravity in the AdS background and recipe for calculation the
Wilson loop, we compute corrections to the energy of quark/anti-quark pair in
the large N limit.
