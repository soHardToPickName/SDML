Graviton scattering in an M-orientifold background
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the scattering of gravitons off a five orientifold in
eleven dimensions. We compare the supergravity result with a two loop M(atrix)
model calculation and find exact agreement. The supergravity calculation
involves nonlinear three graviton effects.
