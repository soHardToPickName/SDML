Kappa-Symmetry of Green-Schwarz Actions in Coset Superspaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The nature of $\kappa$-symmmetry transformations is examined for p-branes
embedded in a class of coset superspaces G/H, where G is an appropriate
supergroup and H is the Lorentz subgroup. It is shown that one of the
conditions $\delta Z^M E_M{}^a = 0$ which characterizes $\kappa$-symmetry
transformations arises very naturally if they are implemented in terms of a
right action of a subgroup of the supergroup G on the supergroup elements
which represent the coset. Unlike the global left action of G on G/H (which
gives rise to supersymmetry on the coset superspace), there is no canonically
defined right action of G on G/H. However, an interpretation of this right
action involving an enlargement of the isotropy group from the Lorentz subgroup
to a subgroup of G with generators which include some of the fermionic
generators of G is suggested. Closure of the generators of this larger
subgroup under commutation leads to the usual `brane scan' for p-branes
which have bosonic degrees of freedom which are worldvolume scalars.
