A note on the decay of noncommutative solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an ansatz for the equations of motion of the noncommutative model
of a tachyonic scalar field interacting with a gauge field, which allows one to
find time-dependent solutions describing decaying solitons. These correspond to
the collapse of lower dimensional branes obtained through tachyon condensation
of unstable brane systems in string theory.
