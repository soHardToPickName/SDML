Shortcuts for Graviton Propagation in a Six Dimensional Brane World
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a six dimensional brane world model with asymmetric warp factors
for time and both extra spatial coordinates, $y$ and $z$. We derive the set of
differential equations governing the shortest graviton path and numerically
solve it for AdS-Schwarzschild and AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om bulks. In both
cases we derive a set of conditions for the existence of shortcuts in bulks
with shielded singularities and show some examples of shortcuts obtained under
these conditions. Consequences are discussed.
