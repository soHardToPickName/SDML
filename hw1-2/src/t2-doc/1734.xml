Hamiltonian Analysis of the Effective Action for Hard Thermal Loops in
  QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action for hard thermal loops in QCD is related to a gauged
WZNW theory. Some of the technical issues of this approach are clarified and
the Hamiltonian formulation is presented. The two-point correlation function
for the induced current in QCD is obtained; some simplifications of the
dynamics of the longitudinal modes are also pointed out.
