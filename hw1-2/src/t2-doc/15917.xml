Eleven-Dimensional Lorentz Symmetry from SUSY Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The supermembrane in light-cone gauge gives rise to a supersymmetric quantum
mechanics system with SU(N) gauge symmetry when the group of area preserving
diffeomorphisms is suitably regulated. de Wit, Marquard and Nicolai showed how
eleven-dimensional Lorentz generators can be constructed from these degrees of
freedom at the classical level. In this paper, these considerations are
extended to the quantum level and it is shown the algebra closes to leading
nontrivial order at large N. A proposal is made for extending these results to
Matrix theory by realizing longitudinal boosts as large N renormalization group
transformations.
