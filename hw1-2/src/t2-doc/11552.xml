Three-Family $SO(10)$ Grand Unification in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The construction of a supersymmetric $SO(10)$ grand unification with 5
left-handed and 2 right-handed families in the four-dimensional heterotic
string theory is presented. The model has one $SO(10)$ adjoint Higgs field. The
$SO(10)$ current algebra is realized at level 3.
