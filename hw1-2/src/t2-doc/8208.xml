A trial to find an elliptic quantum algebra for $sl_2$ using the
  Heisenberg and Clifford algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  A Heisenberg-Clifford realization of a deformed $U(sl_{2})$ by two parameters
$p$ and $q$ is discussed. The commutation relations for this deformed algebra
have interesting connection with the theta functions.
