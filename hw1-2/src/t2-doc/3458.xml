3-dimensional topological sigma-model
</title>

<abstract>
  A 3-dimensional model dual to the Rozansky-Witten topological sigma-model
with a hyper-Kaehler target space is considered. It is demonstrated that a
Feynman diagram calculation of the classical part of its partition function
yields the Milnor linking number.
