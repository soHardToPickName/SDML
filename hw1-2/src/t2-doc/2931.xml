Applications of quantum integrable systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two applications of quantum integrable systems. First, we predict
that it is possible to generate high harmonics from solid state devices by
demostrating that the emission spectrum for a minimally coupled laser field of
frequency $\omega$ to an impurity system of a quantum wire, contains multiples
of the incoming frequency. Second, evaluating expressions for the conductance
in the high temperature regime we show that the caracteristic filling fractions
of the Jain sequence, which occur in the fractional quantum Hall effect, can be
obtained from quantum wires which are described by minimal affine Toda field
theories.
