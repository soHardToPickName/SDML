LINEAR CONNECTIONS ON EXTENDED SPACE-TIME.
</title>

<abstract>
Abstract: A modification of Kaluza-Klein theory is proposed which is general
enough to admit an arbitrary finite noncommutative internal geometry. It is
shown that the existence of a non-trival extension to the total geometry of a
linear connection on space-time places severe restrictions on the structure of
the noncommutative factor. A counter-example is given.
