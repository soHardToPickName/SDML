From Reissner-Nordstr\"om quantum states to charged black holes mass

<abstract>
  In this report we describe quantum Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black-holes
interacting with a complex scalar field. Our analysis is characterized by
solving a Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the proximity of an apparent horizon of
the RN space-time. Subsequently, we obtain a wave-function $\Psi_{RN}[M, Q]$
representing the RN black-hole. A special emphasis is given to the evolution of
the mass-charge rate affected by Hawking radiation. More details can be found
in gr-qc/9709080.
