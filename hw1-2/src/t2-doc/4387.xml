Characterization of Universal Behavior in QCD Dirac Spectra
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture we discuss correlations of the QCD Dirac eigenvalues. We find
that below a scale of $E_c\sim \Lambda/L^2$ they are given by chiral Random
Matrix Theory. This follows from analytical arguments based on partially
quenched Chiral Perturbation Theory and is substantiated by lattice QCD and
instanton liquid simulations.
