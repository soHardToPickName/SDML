Localization of Massless Spinning Particles and the Berry Phase
</title>

<abstract>
  The components of the position operator, at a fixed time, for a massless and
spinning particle with given helicity $\lambda$ described in terms of bosonic
degrees of freedom have an anomalous commutator proportional to $\lambda$. The
position operator generates translations in momentum space. We show that a
ray-representation for these translations emerges due to the non-commuting
components of the position operators and relate this to the Berry-phase for
photons. The Tomita-Chiao experiment then gives support for this relativistic
and quantum mechanical description of photons in terms of non-commuting
position operators.
