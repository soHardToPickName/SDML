The general form of the star-product on the Grassman algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the general form of the noncommutative associative product (the
star-product) on the Grassman algebra; the star-product is treated as a
deformation of the usual "pointwise" product. We show that up to a similarity
transformation, there is only one such product. The relation of the algebra
${\cal F}$, the algebra of elements of the Grassman algebra with the
star-product as a product, to the Clifford algebra is discussed.
