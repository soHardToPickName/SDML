Higher Spin Conserved Currents in $Sp(2M)$ Symmetric Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Infinite set of higher spin conserved charges is found for the $sp(2M)$
symmetric dynamical systems in $\f{1}{2} M (M+1)$-dimensional generalized
spacetime $\M_M$. Since the dynamics in $\M_M$ is equivalent to the conformal
dynamics of infinite towers of fields in $d$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime
with $d=3,4,6,10,...$ for $M=2,4,8,16, ...$, respectively, the constructed
currents in $\M_M$ generate infinite towers of (mostly new) higher spin
conformal currents in Minkowski spacetime. The charges have a form of integrals
of $M$-forms which are bilinear in the field variables and are closed as a
consequence of the field equations. Conservation implies independence of a
value of charge of a local variation of a $M$-dimensional integration surface
$\Sigma \subset \M_M$ analogous to Cauchy surface in the usual spacetime. The
scalar conserved charge provides an invariant bilinear form on the space of
solutions of the field equations that gives rise to a positive definite norm on
the space of quantum states.
