Effective potential in Brane-World scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the stabilization of the radion in the Randall-Sundrum model
through the Casimir energy due to a bulk conformally coupled field. We also
show some exact self-consistent solutions taking into account the backreaction
that this energy induces on the geometry.
