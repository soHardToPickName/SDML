The Negative Energy of Gravitation as Stabilizational Factor in Field
  Theory and Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The left hand side of Einstein's equations G=-T is defined as the tensor of
energy-momentum of gravitational field. Here the energy of gravitation is
negative, the full energy of the system matter+gravitation is equal to zero and
appeared a new process - the annihilation of matter and gravitation. As result,
the cosmological constant is vanished, singularities not exist and black holes
annihilated during the collaps. It is shown, that in field theories not need in
mass renormalization because of automatical compensation of infinities by their
own gravitational energy. The main surprise is the renormalizability of quantum
gravity with negative energy of gravitational background.
