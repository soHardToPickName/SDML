On a gauge invariant description of soliton dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present important elements of a gauge and diffeomorphism invariant
formulation of the moduli space approximation to soliton dynamics. We argue
that explicit velocity-dependent modifications are determined entirely from
gauge and diffeomorphism invariance. We illustrate the formalism for the case
of a Yang-Mills theory on a curved spacetime background.
