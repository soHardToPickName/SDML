TG-Equivariance of Connections and Gauge Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the notion of a connection on a principal bundle $P(M,G)$ from
the point of view of the action of the tangential group $TG$. This leads to a
new definition of a connection and allows to interpret gauge transformations as
effect of the $TG$ action.
