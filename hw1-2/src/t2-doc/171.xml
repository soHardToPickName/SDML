Quantum Mechanical Embedding of Spinning Particle and Induced
  Spin-connection
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper introduces the way of the embedding of spinning particle quantum
mechanically. Schr\"odinger equation on its submanifold obtains the gauge field
as spin connection, and it reduces to the ones obtained by Ohnuki and Kitakado
when we consider $S^2$ in $R^3$. PACS numbers: 03.65
