Collective field approach to gauged principal chiral field at large N
</title>

<abstract>
  The lattice model of principal chiral field interacting with the gauge
fields, which have no kinetic term, is considered. This model can be regarded
as a strong coupling limit of lattice gauge theory at finite temperature. The
complete set of equations for collective field variables is derived in the
large N limit and the phase structure of the model is studied.
