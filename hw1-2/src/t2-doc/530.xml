Colour Charges and the Anti-Screening Contribution to the Interquark
  Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  Asymptotic freedom arises from the dominance of anti-screening over screening
in non-abelian gauge theories. In this paper we will present a simple and
physically appealing derivation of the anti-screening contribution to the
interquark potential. Our method allows us to identify the dominant gluonic
distribution around static quarks. Extensions are discussed.
