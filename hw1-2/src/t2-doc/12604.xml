Some Consequences of Noncommutative Worldsheet of Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper some properties of the superstring with noncommutative
worldsheet are studied. We study the noncommutativity of the spacetime,
generalization of the Poincar\'e symmetry of the superstring, the changes of
the metric, antisymmetric tensor and dilaton.
