BPS Dyon in a Weak Electromagnetic Field: Equations of Motion and
  Radiation Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamics of a BPS dyon in a weak, constant, electromagnetic field is studied
through a perturbative analysis of appropriate non-linear field equations. The
full Lorentz force law for a BPS dyon is established. Also derived are the
radiation fields accompanying the motion.
