Conformal Operators for Partially Massless States
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence is explored for ``partially massless'' fields in
AdS space (which have fewer helicity states than a massive field but more than
a conventional massless field). Such fields correspond in the boundary
conformal field theory to fields obeying a certain conformally-invariant
differential equation that has been described by Eastwood et al. The first
descendant of such a field is a conformal field of negative norm. Hence,
partially massless fields may make more physical sense in de Sitter as opposed
to Anti de Sitter space.
