$CP^2$ soliton scattering: The collective coordinate approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  The $CP^2$ model, with and without a generalized Hopf term, is studied using
the collective coordinate approximation. In the spirit of this approximation,
an ansatz is given which in previous numerical studies was seen to give a good
parameterization of the numerical solution. The equations of motion for the
collective coordinates are then solved analytically, for solitons close
together and for solitons far apart. The solutions show how the generalized
Hopf term changes the scattering angle which in its absence is $90^{\circ}$.
