Simple Calculation of Instanton Corrections in Massive N=2 SU(3) SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an explicit derivation of the Picard-Fuchs equations for N=2
supersymmetric SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with $N_f<6$ massive hypermultiplets
in the fundamental representation. We determine the instanton corrections to
the prepotential in the weak coupling region using the relation between
$\tr<\phi^2>$ and the prepotential. This method can be generalized to other
gauge groups.
