Temperature Dependence of String Theory in the Presence of World-Sheet
  Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  The effect of world-sheet boundaries on the temperature-dependence of bosonic
string theory is studied to first order in string perturbation theory. The
high- temperature behaviour of a theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions has
features suggestive of the high-temperature limit of the confining phase of
large-$n$ $SU(n)$ Yang--Mills theory, recently discussed by Polchinski.
