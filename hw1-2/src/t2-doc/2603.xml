Critical Behavior of the Marinari-Parisi Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the continuum string theory corresponding to the Marinari-Parisi
supersymmetric matrix model. We argue that the world-sheet physics is exotic,
and different from any known supersymmetric string theory. The embedding
superspace coordinates become disordered on the world-sheet, but because of the
noncompactness of the embedding time the disorder becomes complete only at
asymptotic world-sheet scales.
