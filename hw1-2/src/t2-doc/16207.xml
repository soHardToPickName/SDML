On the Poincare polynomials for Landau-Ginzburg Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Poincare polynomials for Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds with
projection operators.Using them we show that special types of dualities
including Poincare duality are realized under certain conditions. When
Calabi-Yau interpretation exists, two simple formulae for Hodge numbers
$h^{2,1}$ and $h^{1,1}$ are obtained.
