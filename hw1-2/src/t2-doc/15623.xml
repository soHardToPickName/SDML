Topological Field Theory As The Key To Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the similarity between CSW theory and the Chern Simons state for
General Relativity in the Ashtekar variables, we explore what the universe
would look like if it were in a state corresponding to a 3D TQFT. We end up
with a construction of propagating ststes for parts of the universe and a
Hilbert space corresponding to a certain approximation. The construction avoids
path integrals, using instead recombination diagrams in a certain tensor
category.
