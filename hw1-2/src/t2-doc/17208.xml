Black Holes, Hawking Radiation and the Information Paradox
</title>

<abstract>
  This talk is about results obtained by Kirill Melnikov and myself pertaining
to the canonical quantization of a massless scalar field in the presence of a
Schwarzschild black hole. After a brief summary of what we did and how we
reproduce the familiar Hawking temperature and energy flux, I focus attention
on how our discussion differs from other treatments. In particular I show that
we can define a system which fakes an equilibrium thermodynamic object whose
entropy is given by the $A/4$ (where $A$ is the area of the black hole
horizon), but for which the assignment of a classical entropy to the system is
incorrect. Finally I briefly discuss a discretized version of the theory which
seems to indicate that things work in a surprising way near $r=0$.
