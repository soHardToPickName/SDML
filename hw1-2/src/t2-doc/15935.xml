A No-Go Theorem for the Nonabelian Topological Mass Mechanism in Four
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that there is no power-counting renormalizable nonabelian
generalization of the abelian topological mass mechanism in four dimensions.
The argument is based on the technique of consistent deformations of the master
equation developed by G. Barnich and one of the authors. Recent attempts
involving extra fields are also commented upon.
