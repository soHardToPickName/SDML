Non-abelian Brane Intersections
</title>

<abstract>
  We study new solutions of the low-energy equations of motion for the
non-abelian D-string. We find a "fuzzy funnel" solution consisting of a
noncommutative four-sphere geometry which expands along the length of the
D-string. We show that this funnel solution has an interpretation as D-strings
ending on a set of orthogonal D5-branes. Although not supersymmetric, the
system appears to be stable within this framework. We also give a dual
description of this configuration as a bion spike in the non-abelian world
volume theory of coincident D5-branes.
