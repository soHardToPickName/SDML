Supergravity on $AdS_{5/4} \times$ Hopf Fibrations and Conformal Field
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain three and four dimensional conformal field theories with less than
maximal supersymmetry by using their supergravity duals. These supergravity
theories are type II on $AdS_5 \times CP^2$, IIA on $AdS_4 \times CP^3$, IIB on
$AdS_5 \times S^5/Z_k$ and D=11 supergravity on $AdS_4 \times S^7/Z_k$. They
are obtained from the spherically compactified ten and eleven dimensional
theories by either Hopf reduction or by winding the U(1) fiber over the base.
