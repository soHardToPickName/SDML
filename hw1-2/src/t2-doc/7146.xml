Heat-kernel coefficients and functional determinants for higher-spin
  fields on the ball
</title>

<abstract>
  The zeta function associated with higher-spin fields on the Euclidean
$4$-ball is investigated. The leading coefficients of the corresponding
heat-kernel expansion are given explicitly and the zeta functional determinant
is calculated. For fermionic fields the determinant is shown to differ for
local and spectral boundary conditions.
