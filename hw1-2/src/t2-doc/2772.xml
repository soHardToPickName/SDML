On higher-dimensional loop algebras, pseudodifferential operators and
  Fock space realizations
</title>

  We discuss a previously discovered [hep-th/9401027] extension of the
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras Map(M,g) which generalizes the Kac-Moody
algebras in 1+1 dimensions and the Mickelsson-Faddeev algebras in 3+1
dimensions to manifolds M of general dimensions. Furthermore, we review the
method of regularizing current algebras in higher dimensions using
pseudodifferential operator (PSDO) symbol calculus. In particular, we discuss
the issue of Lie algebra cohomology of PSDOs and its relation to the Schwinger
terms arising in the quantization process. Finally, we apply this
regularization method to the algebra of the above reference with partial
success, and discuss the remaining obstacles to the construction of a Fock
space representation.
