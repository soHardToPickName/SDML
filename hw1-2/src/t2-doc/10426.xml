Fermionic Subspaces of the Bosonic String
</title>

<abstract>
  A universal symmetric truncation of the bosonic string Hilbert space yields
all known closed fermionic string theories in ten dimensions, their D-branes
and their open descendants. We highlight the crucial role played by group
theory and two-dimensional conformal field theory in the construction and
emphasize the predictive power of the truncation. Such circumstantial evidence
points towards the existence of a mechanism which generates space-time fermions
out of bosons dynamically within the framework of bosonic string theory.
