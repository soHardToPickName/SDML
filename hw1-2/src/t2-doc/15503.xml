Higgs mechanism in the Randall-Sundrum model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the dimensional reduction of a bulk scalar field in the
Randall-Sundrum model. By allowing the scalar field to be non-minimally coupled
to the spacetime curvature we show that it is possible to generate spontaneous
symmetry breaking on the brane.
