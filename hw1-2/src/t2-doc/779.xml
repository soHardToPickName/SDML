Transverse Ward-Takahashi Identity, Anomaly and Schwinger-Dyson Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the path integral formalism, we rederive and extend the transverse
Ward-Takahashi identities (which were first derived by Yasushi Takahashi) for
the vector and the axial vector currents and simultaneously discuss the
possible anomaly for them. Subsequently, we propose a new scheme for writing
down and solving the Schwinger-Dyson equation in which the the transverse
Ward-Takahashi identity together with the usual (longitudinal) Ward-Takahashi
identity are applied to specify the fermion-boson vertex function. Especially,
in two dimensional Abelian gauge theory, we show that this scheme leads to the
exact and closed Schwinger-Dyson equation for the fermion propagator in the
chiral limit (when the bare fermion mass is zero) and that the Schwinger-Dyson
equation can be exactly solved.
