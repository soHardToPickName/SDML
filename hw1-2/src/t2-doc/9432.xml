On mass dependences of the one-loop effective action in simple
  backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  If background fields are soft on the scale set by mass of the particle
involved, a reliable approximation to the field-theoretic one-loop effective
action is obtained by a systematic large mass expansion involving higher-order
Seeley-DeWitt coefficients. Moreover, if the small mass limit of the effective
action in a particular background has been found by some other means, the two
informations may be used to infer the corresponding result for {\em arbitrary}
mass values. This method is used to estimate the one-loop contribution to the
QCD vacuum tunneling amplitude by quarks of arbitrary mass.
