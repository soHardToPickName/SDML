M-Theory solutions with AdS factors
</title>

<abstract>
  Solutions of D=7 maximal gauged supergravity are constructed with metrics
that are a product of a n-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space, with
n=2,3,4,5, and certain Einstein manifolds. The gauge fields have the same form
as in the recently constructed solutions describing the near-horizon limits of
M5-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles. The new solutions do not preserve any
supersymmetry and can be uplifted to obtain new solutions of D=11 supergravity,
which are warped and twisted products of the D=7 metric with a squashed
four-sphere. Some aspects of the stability of the solutions are discussed.
