Topological Twist of osp(2|2)\oplus osp(2|2) Conformal Super Algebra in
  Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A Lagrangian of the topological field theory is found in the twisted
osp(2|2)\oplus osp(2|2)conformal super algebra. The reduction on a moduli space
is then elaborated through the vanishing Noether current.
