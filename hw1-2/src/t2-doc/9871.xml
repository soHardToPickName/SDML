Conformal Dimensions of Two-Derivative BMN Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the anomalous dimensions of BMN operators with two covariant
derivative impurities at the planar level up to first order in the effective
coupling lambda'. The result equals those for two scalar impurities as well as
for mixed scalar and vector impurities given in the literature. Though the
results are the same, the computation is very different from the scalar case.
This is basically due to the existence of a non-vanishing overlap between the
derivative impurity and the ``background'' field Z. We present details of these
differences and their consequences.
