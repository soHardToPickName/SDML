Parasupersymmetric Quantum Mechanics with Generalized Deformed
  Parafermions
</title>

<abstract>
  A superposition of bosons and generalized deformed parafermions corresponding
to an arbitrary paraquantization order $p$ is considered to provide
deformations of parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics. New families of
parasupersymmetric Hamiltonians are constructed in connection with two examples
of su(2) nonlinear deformations such as introduced by Polychronakos and
Ro\v cek.
