Introduction to Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  These lectures give a self-contained introduction to supersymmetry from a
modern perspective. Emphasis is placed on material essential to understanding
duality. Topics include: central charges and BPS-saturated states,
supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models, N=2 Yang-Mills theory, holomorphy and
the N=2 Yang-Mills beta function, supersymmetry in 2, 6, 10, and 11 spacetime
dimensions.
