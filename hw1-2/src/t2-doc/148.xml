Dilatonic AdS-Kerr Solution to AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the $AdS_5$ solution deformed by a non-constant dilaton
interpolating between the standard AdS (UV region) and flat boundary background
(IR region). We show that this dilatonic solution can be generalized to the
case of a non-flat boundaries provided that the metric of the boundaries
satisfies the vacuum Einstein field equations. As an example, we describe the
case when the four-dimensional boundaries represent the Kerr space-time.
