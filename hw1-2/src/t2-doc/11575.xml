Supersymmetry of topological Kerr-Newmann-Taub-NUT-aDS spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the topological Kerr-Newman-aDS solutions by including NUT charge
and find generalizations of the Robinson-Bertotti solution to the negative
cosmological constant case with different topologies. We show how all these
solutions can be obtained as limits of the general Plebanski-Demianski
solution. We study the supersymmetry properties of all these solutions in the
context of gauged N=2,d=4 supergravity. Generically they preserve at most 1/4
of the total supersymmetry. In the Plebanski-Demianski case, although gauged
N=2,d=4 supergravity does not have electric-magnetic duality, we find that the
family of supersymmetric solutions still enjoys a sort of electric-magnetic
duality in which electric and magnetic charges and mass and Taub-NUT charge are
rotated simultaneously.
