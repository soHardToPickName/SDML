Zeta functions, renormalization group equations, and the effective
  action
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate how to extract all the one-loop renormalization group
equations for arbitrary quantum field theories from knowledge of an appropriate
Seeley--DeWitt coefficient. By formally solving the renormalization group
equations to one loop, we renormalization group improve the classical action,
and use this to derive the leading-logarithms in the one-loop effective action
for arbitrary quantum field theories.
