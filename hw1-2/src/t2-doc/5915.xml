Screening Currents Ward Identity and Integral Formulas for the WZNW
  Correlation Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive, based on the Wakimoto realization, the integral formulas for the
WZNW correlation functions. The role of the ``screening currents Ward
identity'' is demonstrated with explicit examples. We also give a more simple
proof of a previous result.
