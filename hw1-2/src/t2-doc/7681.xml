Restricted Supergauge invariance, N=2 Coadjoint Orbit and N=2 Quantum

<abstract>
  It is shown that the N=2 superconformal transformations are restricted N=1
supergauge transformations of a supergauge theory with Osp(2,2) as a gauge
group. Based on this result, a canonical derivation of the Osp(2,2) current
algebra in the superchiral gauge formulation of N=2 supergravity is presented.
