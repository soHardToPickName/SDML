Planck-Scale Physics and the Peccei-Quinn Mechanism
</title>

<abstract>
  Global-symmetry violating higher-dimension operators, expected to be induced
by Planck-scale physics, in general drastically alter the properties of the
axion field associated with the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong-CP problem,
and render this solution unnatural. The particle physics and cosmology
associated with other global symmetries can also be significantly changed.
