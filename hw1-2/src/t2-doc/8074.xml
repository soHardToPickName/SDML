The Principle of the Fermionic Projector II, Derivation of the Effective
  Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  The principle of the fermionic projector is studied for a fermionic projector
which in the vacuum is the direct sum of seven identical massive sectors and
one massless left-handed sector, each of which is composed of three Dirac seas.
It is shown under general assumptions and for an interaction via general chiral
and (pseudo)scalar potentials that the sectors spontaneously form pairs, which
are referred to as blocks. The resulting so-called effective interaction can be
described by chiral potentials corresponding to the effective gauge group
$SU(2) \otimes SU(3) \otimes U(1)^3$. The properties of the corresponding gauge
fields are analyzed.
  The similarity of this model to the standard model gives a strong indication
that the principle of the fermionic projector is of physical significance.
