Momentum Lattice for CHL String
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose some analogue of the Narain lattice for CHL string. The symmetries
of this lattice are the symmetries of the perturbative spectrum. We explain in
this language the known results about the possible gauge groups in compactified
theory. For the four-dimensional theory, we explicitly describe the action of
S-duality on the background fields. We show that the moduli spaces of the six,
seven and eight-dimensional compactifications coincide with the moduli spaces
of the conjectured Type IIA, M Theory and F Theory duals. We classify the
rational components of the boundary of the moduli space in seven, eight and
nine dimensions.
