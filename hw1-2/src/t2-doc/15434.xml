Fusion and singular vectors in A1{(1)} highest weight cyclic modules
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the interplay between the fusion formalism of conformal field
theory and the Knizhnik--Zamolodchikov equation leads to explicit formulae for
the singular vectors in the highest weight representations of A1{(1)}.
