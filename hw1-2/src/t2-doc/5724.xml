On zigzag-invariant strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a world-sheet realization of the zigzag-invariant strings as a
perturbed WZNW model at large negative level. We argue that the gravitational
dressing produces additional fixed points of the dressed renormalization beta
function. One of these new critical points can be interpreted as a
zigzag-invariant string model.
