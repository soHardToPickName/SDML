Monopoles in Weinberg-Salam Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new type of spherically symmetric monopole and dyon solutions
with the magnetic charge $ 4\pi/e$ in the standard Weinberg-Salam model. The
monopole (and dyon) could be interpreted as a non-trivial hybrid between the
abelian Dirac monopole and non-abelian 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole (with an
electric charge). We discuss the possible physical implications of the
electroweak dyon.
