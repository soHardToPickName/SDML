The effective action and quantum gauge transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  The local symmetry transformations of the quantum effective action for
general gauge theory are found. Additional symmetries arise under consideration
of background gauges. Together with "trivial" gauge transformations, vanishing
on mass shell, they can be used for construction simple gauge generators. For
example, for the Yang-Mills theory the classically invariant effective action
is obtained, reproducing DeWitt's result. For rank one theories a natural
generalization is proposed.
