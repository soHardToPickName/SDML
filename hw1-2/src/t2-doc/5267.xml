Schroedinger Representation of CP(N) Model for Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the 1+1 dimensional CP(N) model in the large N limit by using the
Schroedinger representation. Starting from the Hamiltonian analysis of the
model, we present the variational gap equation resulting from the Gaussian
trial wave functional. The renormalization of the theory is performed with
insertion of mass and energy counter-terms, and the dynamical generation of
mass and the energy eigenvalue are derived.
