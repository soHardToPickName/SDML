Intersecting Branes and Generalized Vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the effective theory of intersecting branes and investigate the
BPS monopoles in the theory. The monopoles obtained are the generalization of
Nielsen-Olesen vortex. We study the properties of the solutions and interpret
them as the D0-branes on the brane-intersections.
