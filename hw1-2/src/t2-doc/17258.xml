Domain walls of D=5 supergravity and fixed points of N=1 Super Yang
  Mills

<abstract>
  Employing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we give an explicit supergravity
picture for the renormalization group flow of couplings 4-d super Yang Mills
with four supercharges. The solution represents a domain wall of 5-d, N=2
supergravity, that interpolates between two (different) AdS_5 vacua and is
obtained by gauging a U(1) subgroup of the SU(2) R-symmetry. On the
supergravity side the domain wall couples only to scalar fields from vector
mulitplets, but not to scalars from hyper multiplets. We discuss the c-theorem,
the beta-functions and consider two examples: one is the sugra solution related
to Z_k orbifolds (corresponding to N=2 SYM) and the other is an orientifold
construction for an elliptically fibered CY with F_1 basis (corresponding to
N=1 SYM).
