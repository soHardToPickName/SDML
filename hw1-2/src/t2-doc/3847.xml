"Self-tuning" and Conformality
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an infinite-volume brane world setup where a codimension one
brane is coupled to bulk gravity plus a scalar field with vanishing potential.
The latter is protected by bulk supersymmetry, which is intact even if brane
supersymmetry is completely broken as the volume of the extra dimension is
infinite. Within this setup we discuss a flat solution with a ``self-tuning''
property, that is, such a solution exists for a continuous range of values for
the brane tension. This infinite-volume solution is free of any singularities,
and has the property that the brane cosmological constant is protected by bulk
supersymmetry. We, however, also point out that consistency of the coupling
between bulk gravity and brane matter generically appears to require that the
brane world-volume theory be conformal.
