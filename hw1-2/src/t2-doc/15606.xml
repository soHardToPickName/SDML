Soliton vacuum energies and the CP(1) model
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum properties of solitons at one loop can be related to phase shifts
of waves on the soliton background. These can be combined with heat kernel
methods to calculate various parameters. The vacuum energy of a CP(1) soliton
in 2+1 dimensions is calculated as an example.
