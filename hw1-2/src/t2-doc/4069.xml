A Note on 1/4-BPS States
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions of N=4 super Yang-Mills theories that are
invariant under 1/4 of the supersymmetry generators. Expressions for the mass
and electric charge of the configurations are derived as functions on the
monopole moduli space. These functions also provide a method of determining the
number of normalisable bosonic zero modes.
