Multi-Instanton Measure from Recursion Relations in N=2 Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the recursion relations found in the framework of N=2 Super
Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SU(2), we reconstruct the structure of the
instanton moduli space and its volume form for all winding numbers. The
construction is reminiscent of the Deligne-Knudsen-Mumford compactification and
uses an analogue of the Wolpert restriction phenomenon which arises in the case
of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces.
