Exact non-abelian duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate non-abelian gaugings of WZNW models. When the gauged group is
semisimple we are able to present exact formulae for the dual conformal field
theory, for all values of the level $k$. The results are then applied to
non-abelian target space duality in string theory, showing that the standard
formulae are quantum mechanically well defined in the low energy limit if the
gauged group is semisimple.
