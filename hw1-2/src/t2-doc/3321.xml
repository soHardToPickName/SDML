D(NA)-Branes

<abstract>
  We engineer a configuration of branes in type IIB string theory whose
mechanical structure is that of a DNA molecule. We obtain it by considering a
T-dual description of the quantum Hall soliton. Using a probe analysis, we
investigate the dynamics of the system and show that it is stable against
radial perturbations. We exercise a certain amount of restraint in discussing
applications to biophysics.
