Intrinsic Vertex Regularization and Renormalization in $\phi^4$ Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Based upon the intrinsic relation between the divergent lower point functions
and the convergent higher point ones in the renormalizable quantum field
theories, we propose a new method for regularization and renormalization in
QFT. As an example, we renormalize the $\phi^{4}$ theory at the one loop order
by means of this method.
