Super Triple Systems and Applications to Para-Statistics and Yand-Baxter
  Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the notion of ortho-symplectic super triple system, and apply it
to find solutions of super Yang-Baxter equation. Also, the para-statistics are
formulated as a Lie-super triple system.
