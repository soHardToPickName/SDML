The extended conformal theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the recently introduced method of Algebraic Bosonization of
(1+1)-dimensional fermionic systems by discussing the specific case of the
Calogero-Sutherland model. A comparison with the Bethe Ansatz results is also
presented.
