The Parisi-Sourlas Mechanism in Yang-Mills Theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  The Parisi-Sourlas mechanism is exhibited in pure Yang-Mills theory. Using
the new scalar degrees of freedom derived from the non-linear gauge condition,
we show that the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory is equivalent to
a 4D O(1,3) sigma model in a random field. We then show that the leading term
of this equivalent theory is invariant under supersymmetry transformations
where (x^{2}+\thetabar\theta) is unchanged. This leads to dimensional reduction
proving the equivalence of the non-perturbative sector of Yang-Mills theory to
a 2D O(1,3) sigma model.
