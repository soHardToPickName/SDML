Trace Anomaly and Quantization of Maxwell's Theory on Non-Commutative
  Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical and symmetrical energy-momentum tensors and their non-zero
traces in Maxwell's theory on non-commutative spaces have been found. Dirac's
quantization of the theory under consideration has been performed. I have found
the extended Hamiltonian and equations of motion in the general gauge covariant
form.
