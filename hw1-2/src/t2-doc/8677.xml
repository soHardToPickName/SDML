Dynamical Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QED in a Magnetic Field: Toward
  Exact Results
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a (first, to the best of our knowledge) essentially soluble
example of dynamical symmetry breaking phenomenon in a 3+1 dimensional gauge
theory without fundamental scalar fields: QED in a constant magnetic field.
