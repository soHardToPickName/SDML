A derivation of Witten's conjecture relating Donaldson and
  Seiberg-Witten invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize Witten's conjectured formula relating Donaldson and
Seiberg-Witten invariants to manifolds of non-simple type, via equivariant
localization techniques. This approach does not use the theory of non-abelian
monopoles, but works directly on the Donaldson-Witten and Seiberg-Witten moduli
spaces. We give a formal derivation of Witten's conjecture and its
generalization, making use of an infinite dimensional version of the abelian
localization theorem.
