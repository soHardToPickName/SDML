D-instantons and Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Matrix Model aspect of configurations saturating a fixed
number of fermionic zero modes. This number is independent of the rank of the
gauge group and the instanton number. This will allow us to define a
large-$N_c$ limit of the embeddeding of $K$ D-instantons in the Matrix Model
and make contact with the leading term (the measure factor) of the supergravity
computations of D-instanton effects. We show that the connection between these
two approaches is done through the Abelian modes of the Matrix variables.
