Mode Interactions of the Tachyon Condensate in p-adic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the fluctuation modes for lump solutions of the tachyon effective
potential in p-adic open string theory. We find a discrete spectrum with
equally spaced mass squared levels. We also find that the interactions derived
from this field theory are consistent with p-adic string amplitudes for excited
string states.
