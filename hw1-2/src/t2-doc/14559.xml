Classical and quantum N=1 super $W_\infty$-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct higher-spin N=1 super algebras as extensions of the super
Virasoro algebra containing generators for all spins $s\ge 3/2$. We find two
distinct classical (Poisson) algebras on the phase super space. Our results
indicate that only one of them can be consistently quantized.
