Maximally symmetric D-branes in gauged WZW models
</title>

<abstract>
  Gluing conditions are proposed to characterize the D-branes in gauged WZW
models. From them the boundary conditions for the group-valued and the
subgroup-valued fields are determined. We construct a gauged WZW action for
open strings that coincides classically with those written previously, when the
gluing conditions are imposed.
