Comment on ``Additional analytically exact solutions for three-anyons''
  and ``Fermion Ground State of Three Particles in a Harmonic Potential Well
  and Its Anyon Interpolation''
</title>

<abstract>
  The claim put forward in [hep-th/9512051, hep-th/9612244] that the energies
of the ``missing'' states of three anyons in a harmonic potential depend
linearly on the statistics parameter, is incorrect because the wave functions
proposed do not satisfy the anyonic interchange conditions.
