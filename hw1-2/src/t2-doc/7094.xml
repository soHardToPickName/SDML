Noncommutative Cohomological Field Theory and GMS soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that it is possible to construct a quantum field theory that is
invariant under the translation of the noncommutative parameter
$\theta_{\mu\nu}$. This is realized in a noncommutative cohomological field
theory. As an example, a noncommutative cohomological scalar field theory is
constructed, and its partition function is calculated. The partition function
is the Euler number of Gopakumar, Minwalla and Strominger (GMS) soliton space.
