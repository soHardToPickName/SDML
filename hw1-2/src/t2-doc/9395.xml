Generalization of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach for higher order singular
  systems

<abstract>
  We generalize the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for higher order singular
systems and obtain the equations of motion as total differential equations. To
do this we first study the constraint structure present in such systems.
