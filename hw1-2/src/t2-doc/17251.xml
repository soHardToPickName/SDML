Supersymmetric Defect Expansion in CFT from AdS Supertubes
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/dCFT correspondence is used to show that a planar q-dimensional
superconformal CFT defect expands, under the addition of electric charge and
angular momentum, to a supersymmetric higher-dimensional defect of geometry R^q
x C, where C is an arbitrary curve. The dual string theory process is the
expansion of D-branes and fundamental strings into a supertube in an AdS
background.
