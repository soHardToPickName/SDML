  General fermionic expressions for the branching functions of the rational
coset conformal field theories $\widehat{su}(2)_{M}\times
\widehat{su}(2)_N/\widehat{su}(2)_{M+N}$ are given. The equality of the bosonic
and fermionic representations for the branching functions is proven by
introducing polynomial truncations of these branching functions which are the
configuration sums of the RSOS models in regime III. The path space
interpretation of the RSOS models provides recursion relations for the
configuration sums. The proof of the recursion relations for the fermionic
expressions is given by using telescopic expansion techniques. The
configuration sums of the RSOS model in regime II which correspond to the
branching functions of the $Z_{M+N}$-parafermion conformal field theory are
obtained by the duality transformation $q\rightarrow q^{-1}$.
