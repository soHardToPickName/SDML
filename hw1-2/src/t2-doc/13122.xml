Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The nontrivial transformation of the phase space path integral measure under
certain discretized analogues of canonical transformations is computed. This
Jacobian is used to derive a quantum analogue of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation
for the generating function of a canonical transformation that maps any quantum
system to a system with a vanishing Hamiltonian. A formal perturbative solution
of the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation is given.
