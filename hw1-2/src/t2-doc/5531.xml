Duality and the cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  A dynamical theory is studied in which a scalar field $\phi$ in Einstein-
Minkowski space is coupled to the four-velocity $N_{\mu}$ of a preferred
inertial observer in that space. As a consistent requirement on this coupling
we study a principle of duality invariance of the dynamical mass- term of
$\phi$ at some universal length in the small-distance regime. In the
large-distance regime duality breaking can be introduced by giving a back-
ground value to $\phi$ and a back-ground direction to $N_{\mu}$. It is shown
that, in an appropriate approximation, duality breaking can be related to the
emergence of a characteristic phase in which the condensation of the ground
state allows massive excitations with a characteristic scale of squared mass
which agrees with present observational bound for the cosmological constant.
