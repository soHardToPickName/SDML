Non-perturbative K3 Orientifolds with NS-NS B-flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider non-perturbative six dimensional N=1 space-time supersymmetric
orientifolds of Type IIB on K3 with non-trivial NS-NS B-flux. All of these
models are non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pictures. Thus,
some states in such compactifications arise in ``twisted'' open string sectors
which lack world-sheet description in terms of D-branes. We also discuss their
dual F-theory compactifications on certain Voisin-Borcea orbifolds. In
particular, the explicit construction of non-perturbative K3 orientifolds with
NS-NS B-flux gives additional evidence for the conjectured extension of
Nikulin's classification in the context of Voisin-Borcea orbifolds.
