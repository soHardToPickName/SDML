A Note on Softly Broken MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider generic MQCD configurations with matter described by semi-infinte
D4-branes and softly broken supersymmetry. We show that the matter sector does
not introduce supersymmetry breaking parameters so that the most relevant
supersymmetry breaking operator at low energies is the gaugino mass term. By
studying the run-away properties of these models in the decoupling limit of the
adjoint matter, we argue that these softly broken MQCD configurations fail to
capture the infrared physics of QCD at scales below the gaugino mass scale.
