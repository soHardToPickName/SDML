Local U(2,2) Symmetry in Relativistic Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  Local gauge freedom in relativistic quantum mechanics is derived from a
measurement principle for space and time. For the Dirac equation, one obtains
local U(2,2) gauge transformations acting on the spinor index of the wave
functions. This local U(2,2) symmetry allows a unified description of
electrodynamics and general relativity as a classical gauge theory.
