Explicit gauge invariant quantization of the Schwinger model on a circle
  in the functional Schr\"odinger representation
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Schwinger model on a circle by first finding the explicit
groundstate functional(s). Having done this, we give the structure of the
Hilbert space and derive bosonization formulae in this formalism.
