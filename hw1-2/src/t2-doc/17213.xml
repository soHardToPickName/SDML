Horizontal and Vertical Five-Branes in Heterotic/F-Theory Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the heterotic string on an elliptic Calabi-Yau three-fold with
five-branes wrapping curves in the base ('horizontal' curves) of the Calabi-Yau
as well as some elliptic fibers ('vertical' curves). We show that in this
generalized set-up, where the association of the heterotic side with the
$F$-theory side is changed relative to the purely vertical situation, the
number of five-branes wrapping the elliptic fibers still matches the
corresponding number of $F$-theory three-branes.
