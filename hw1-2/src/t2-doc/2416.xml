Colliding Singularities in F-theory and Phase Transitions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study F-theory on elliptic threefold Calabi-Yau near colliding
singularities. We demonstrate that resolutions of those singularities
generically correspond to transitions to phases characterized by new tensor
multiplets and enhanced gauge symmetry. These are governed by the dynamics of
tensionless strings. We also find new transition points which are associated
with several small instantons simultaneously shrinking to zero size.
