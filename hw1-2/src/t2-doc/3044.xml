Geometry of solutions of N=2 SYM-theory in harmonic superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  In harmonic superspace, the classical equations of motion of $D=4, N=2$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for Minkowski and Euclidean spaces are
analyzed. We study dual superfield representations of equations and subsidiary
conditions corresponding to classical SYM-solutions with different symmetries.
In particular, alternative superfield constructions of self-dual and static
solutions are described in the framework of the harmonic approach.
