Graded Parafermions
</title>

<abstract>
  A graded generalization of the Z_k parafermionic current osp(1|2)/U(1) coset
conformal field theory. The structure of the parafermionic highest-weight
modules is analyzed and the dimensions of the fields of the theory are
determined. A free field realization of the graded parafermionic system is
obtained and the structure constants of the current algebra are found. Although
the theory is not unitary, it presents good reducibility properties.
