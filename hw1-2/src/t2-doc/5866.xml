Cohomological aspects of Abelian gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some aspects of cohomological properties of a two-dimensional free
Abelian gauge theory in the framework of BRST formalism. We derive the
conserved and nilpotent BRST- and co-BRST charges and express the Hodge
decomposition theorem in terms of these charges and a conserved bosonic charge
corresponding to the Laplacian operator. It is because of the topological
nature of free U(1) gauge theory that the Laplacian operator goes to zero when
equations of motion are exploited. We derive two sets of topological invariants
which are related to each-other by a certain kind of duality transformation and
express the Lagrangian density of this theory as the sum of terms that are
BRST- and co-BRST invariants. Mathematically, this theory captures together
some of the key features of Witten- and Schwarz type of topological field
theories.
