Some chiral rings of N=2 discrete superconformal series induced by SL(2)
  degenerate conformal field theories

<abstract>
  By generalizing a fermionic construction, a natural relation is found between
SL(2) degenerate conformal field theories and some N=2 discrete superconformal
series. These non-unitary models contain, as a subclass, N=2 minimal models.
The construction permits one to investigate the properties of chiral operators
in the N=2 models. A chiral ring reveals a close connection with underlying
quantum group structures.
