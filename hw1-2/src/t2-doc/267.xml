AdS/CFT Duals of Topological Black Holes and the Entropy of Zero-Energy
  States
</title>

<abstract>
  The horizon of a static black hole in Anti-deSitter space can be spherical,
planar, or hyperbolic. The microscopic dynamics of the first two classes of
black holes have been extensively discussed recently within the context of the
AdS/CFT correspondence. We argue that hyperbolic black holes introduce new and
fruitful features in this respect, allowing for more detailed comparisons
between the weak and strong coupling regimes. In particular, by focussing on
the stress tensor and entropy of some particular states, we identify unexpected
increases in the entropy of Super-Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling that are
not accompanied by increases in the energy. We describe a highly degenerate
state at zero temperature and zero energy density. We also find that the
entanglement entropy across a Rindler horizon in exact AdS_5 is larger than
might have been expected from the dual SYM theory. Besides, we show that
hyperbolic black holes can be described as thermal Rindler states of the dual
conformal field theory in flat space.
