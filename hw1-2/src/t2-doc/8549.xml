Extended Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics

<abstract>
  A parametrization of the Hamiltonian of the generalized Witten model of the
SUSY QM by a single arbitrary function in d=1 has been obtained for an
arbitrary number of the supersymmetries N. Possible applications of this
formalism have been discussed. It has been shown that the N=1 and 2 conformal
SUSY QM is generalized for any N.
