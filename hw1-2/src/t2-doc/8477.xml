Critical Statistical Charge for Anyonic Superconductivity
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine a criterion for the anyonic superconductivity at zero temperature
in Abelian matter-coupled Chern-Simons gauge field theories in three
dimensions. By solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations, we obtain a critical
value of the statistical charge for the superconducting phase in a massless
fermion-Chern-Simons model.
