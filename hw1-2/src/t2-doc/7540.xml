SU(2) Charges as Angular-momentum in N=1 Self-dual Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=1 self-dual supergravity has SL(2.C) symmetry. This symmetry results in
SU(2) charges as the angular-momentum. As in the non-supersymmetric self-dual
gravity, the currents are also of their potentials and are therefore
identically conserved. The charges are generally invariant and gauge covariant
under local SU(2) transforms approaching to be rigid at spatial infinity. The
Poisson brackets constitute su(2) algebra and hence can be interpreted as the
generally covariant conservative angular-momentum.
