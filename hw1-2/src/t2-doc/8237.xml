Brane Variation Dirac Style

<abstract>
  Dirac prescription for dealing with brane dynamics invokes a rest frame
formulation of the 'sandwich' brane action. We demonstrate this method by first
pedagogically re-deriving Snell law. Applying the method to a general N-dim
brane evolving in some (N+1)-dim background, the resulting equations of motion
are:
  (i) Israel continuity condition, (ii) Energy/momentum conservation on the
brane, and (iii) Geodetic-type equation for the brane.
  Remarkably, the last two equations survive even when the bulk gravitational
coupling is switched off. Special attention is drawn to the Regge-Teitelboim
and Randall-Sundrum cases.
