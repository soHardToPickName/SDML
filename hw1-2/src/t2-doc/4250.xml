Involution and Constrained Dynamics I: The Dirac Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the theory of systems with constraints from the point of view of the
formal theory of partial differential equations. For finite-dimensional systems
we show that the Dirac algorithm completes the equations of motion to an
involutive system. We discuss the implications of this identification for field
theories and argue that the involution analysis is more general and flexible
than the Dirac approach. We also derive intrinsic expressions for the number of
degrees of freedom.
