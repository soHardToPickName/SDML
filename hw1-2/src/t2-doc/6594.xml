Stochastic Quantization of the Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss Stochastic Quantization of $d$=3 dimensional non-Abelian
Chern-Simons theory. We demonstrate that the introduction of an appropriate
regulator in the Langevin equation yields a well-defined equilibrium limit,
thus leading to the correct propagator. We also analyze the connection between
$d$=3 Chern-Simons and $d$=4 Topological Yang-Mills theories showing the
equivalence between the corresponding regularized partition functions. We study
the construction of topological invariants and the introduction of a
non-trivial kernel as an alternative regularization.
