Holographic Cosmology and its Relevant Degrees of Freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the options for cosmological holography. We suggest that a
global and time--symmetric version of the Fischler-Susskind bound is the most
natural generalization of the holographic bound encountered in AdS and De
Sitter space. A consistent discussion of cosmological holography seems to imply
an understanding of the notion of ``number of degrees of freedom'' that
deviates from its simple definition as the entropy of the current state. The
introduction of a more adequate notion of degree of freedom makes the suggested
variation of the Fischler-Susskind bound look like a stringent and viable bound
in all 4--dimensional cosmologies without a cosmological constant.
