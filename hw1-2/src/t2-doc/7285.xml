N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld actions from
  superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  New non-abelian supersymmetric generalizations of the four-dimensional
Born-Infeld action are constructed in N=1 and N=2 superspace, to all orders in
the gauge superfield strength. The proposed actions are dictated by simple
(manifestly supersymmetric and gauge-covariant) non-linear constraints.
