Brane Configurations of BPS Domain Walls for the N=1^* SU(N) Gauge
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric domain walls in N=1 SU(N) gauge theory with 3 massive
adjoint representation chiral multiplets. This theory, known as N=1^*, can be
obtained as a massive deformation of N=4 Yang-Mills theory. Following
Polchinski and Strassler, we consider the string dual of this theory in terms
of spherical 5-branes and construct BPS domain walls interpolating between the
many vacua. We compare our results to field theoretic domain walls and also
find that this work is related to the physics of expanded ``dielectric'' branes
near zero radius.
