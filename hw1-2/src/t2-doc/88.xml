Four-dimensional N=1 Z_N X Z_M Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the tadpole equations and their solutions for a class of
four-dimensional orientifolds with orbifold group Z_N X Z_M, and we present the
massless bosonic spectra of these models. Surprisingly we find no consistent
solutions for the models with Z_2 X Z_4 and Z_4 X Z_4 orbifold groups.
