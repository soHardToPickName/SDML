Gravitating Non-Abelian Solitons and Black Holes with Yang-Mills Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a review of gravitating particle-like and black hole solutions
with non-Abelian gauge fields. The emphasis is given to the description of the
structure of the solutions and to the connection with the results of flat space
soliton physics. We describe the Bartnik-McKinnon solitons and the non-Abelian
black holes arising in the Einstein-Yang-Mills theory, and their various
generalizations. These include axially symmetric and slowly rotating
configurations, solutions with higher gauge groups, $\Lambda$-term, dilaton,
and higher curvature corrections. The stability issue is discussed as well. We
also describe the gravitating generalizations for flat space monopoles,
sphalerons, and Skyrmions.
