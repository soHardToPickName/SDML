``Integrating in'' and exact superpotentials in 4d
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss integrating out matter fields and integrating in matter fields in
four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. Highly nontrivial exact
superpotentials can be easily obtained by starting from a known theory and
integrating in matter.
