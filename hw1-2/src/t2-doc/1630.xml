Tunneling into the Randall-Sundrum Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a modification of the Randall-Sundrum scenario which doesn't
involve branes with the negative tensions. In our scenario four-dimensional
brane world is produced by the external field. The probability of this process
is calculated and the physical features of the model are discussed.
