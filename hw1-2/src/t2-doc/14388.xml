Gravitationally bound monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct monopole solutions in SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs theory,
carrying magnetic charge n. For vanishing and small Higgs selfcoupling, these
multimonopole solutions are gravitationally bound. Their mass per unit charge
is lower than the mass of the n=1 monopole. For large Higgs selfcoupling only a
repulsive phase exists.
