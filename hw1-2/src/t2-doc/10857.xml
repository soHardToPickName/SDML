Precursors see inside black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that, given the nonlocal nature of precursors in AdS/CFT
correspondence, the boundary field theory contains information about events
inside a black hole horizon. The essence of our proposal is sketched in figure
1, and relies on the global nature of event horizons.
