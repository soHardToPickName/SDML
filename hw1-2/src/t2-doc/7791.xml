One-Loop Effective Action for the Extended Spinor Electrodynamics with
  Violation of Lorentz and CPT Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  If violation of Lorentz and CPT symmetry is introduced into the fermion
sector of conventional quantum electrodynamics, then the Chern-Simons term is
radiatively induced with finite nonzero coefficient, as well as the Maxwell
term is with logarithmically divergent one. The heat kernel expansion and the
proper time methods are used to determine the effective action in the one-loop
approximation unambiguously.
