Boundary spectrum in the sine-Gordon model with Dirichlet boundary
  conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the spectrum of boundary bound states for the sine-Gordon model with
Dirichlet boundary conditions, closing the bootstrap and providing a complete
description of all the poles in the boundary reflection factors. The boundary
Coleman-Thun mechanism plays an important role in the analysis. Two basic
lemmas are introduced which should hold for any 1+1-dimensional boundary field
theory, allowing the general method to be applied to other models.
