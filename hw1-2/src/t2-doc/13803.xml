Off-shell Supersymmetry versus Hermiticity in the Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that off-shell four-dimensional supersymmetry implies strange
hermiticity properties for the N=1 RNS superstring. However, these hermiticity
properties become natural when the N=1 superstring is embedded into an N=2
superstring.
