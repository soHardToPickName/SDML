An application of supersymmetric quantum mechanics to a planar physical
  system
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetry (SUSY) in non-relativistic quantum mechanics (QM) is applied to
a 2-dimensional physical system: a neutron in an external magnetic field. The
superpotential and the two-component wave functions of the ground state are
found out.
