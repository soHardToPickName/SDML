Order Parameters for Non-Abelian Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Owing to subtle issues concerning quantum fluctuations and gauge fixing, a
formulation of a general procedure to specify the realization of non-Abelian
gauge symmetry has evaded all earlier attempts. In this Letter, we discuss
these subtleties and present two sets of order parameters for non-Abelian gauge
theories. Such operators directly probe the manifest low energy symmetry group
and are crucial for the study of the phase diagram of a non-Abelian gauge
theory.
