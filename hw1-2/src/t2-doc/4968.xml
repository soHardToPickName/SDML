On Wilson Surfaces in Topological Chern-Simons Interaction in (3+1)
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We comment on the regularization of the expectation values of Wilson surfaces
for the bosonic string in the (3+1) dimensions. We analyze the singular
behaviors of propagator for the Chern-Simons action with the additional higher
order terms.
