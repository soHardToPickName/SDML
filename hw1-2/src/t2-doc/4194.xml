On a Possibility of Membrane Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  Tensionless null p-branes in arbitrary cosmological backgrounds are
considered and their motion equations are solved. It is shown that an ideal
fluid of null p-branes may be considered as a source of gravity for
D-dimensional Friedmann- Robertson-Walker universes.
