Exact string background from a WZW model based on the Heisenberg group
</title>

<abstract>
  A WZW model for the non-semi-simple D-dimensional Heisenberg group, which
directly generalizes the E_{2}^{c} group, is constructed. It is found to
correspond to an D-dimensional string background of plane-wave type with
physical Lorentz signature D-2. Perturbative and non-perturbative
considerations lead both to an integer central charge c=D.
