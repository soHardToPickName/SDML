Quantum Hall Effect in Higher Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Following recent work on the quantum Hall effect on $S^4$, we solve the
Landau problem on the complex projective spaces ${\bf C}P^k$ and discuss
quantum Hall states for such spaces. Unlike the case of $S^4$, a finite spatial
density can be obtained with a finite number of internal states for each
particle. We treat the case of ${\bf C}P^2$ in some detail considering both
Abelian and nonabelian background fields. The wavefunctions are obtained and
incompressibility of the Hall states is shown. The case of ${\bf C}P^3$ is
related to the case of $S^4$.
