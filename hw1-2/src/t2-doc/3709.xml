Macroscopic Charged Heterotic String
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical solutions of equations of motion in low energy effective field
theory, describing fundamental charged heterotic string, are found. These
solutions automatically carry an electric current equal to the charge per unit
length, and hence are accompanied by both, electric and magnetic fields. Force
between two parallel strings vanish due to cancellation between electric and
magnetic forces, and also between graviton, dilaton, and antisymmetric tensor
field induced forces. Multi-string solutions describing configuration of
parallel strings are also found. Finally, the solutions are shown to possess
partially broken space-time supersymmetry.
