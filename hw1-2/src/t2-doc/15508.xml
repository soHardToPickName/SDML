Determinant of twisted chiral Dirac Operator on the Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the overlap formulation, we calculate the fermionic determinant on the
lattice for chiral fermions with twisted boundary conditions in two dimensions.
When the lattice spacing tends to zero we recover the results of the usual
string-theory continuum calculations.
