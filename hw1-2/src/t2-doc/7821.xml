Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanical Description of Four Dimensional Black
  Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  By assuming the existence of a novel multipronged string state for
D-particles interacting with D-brane intersections in type IIA string theory,
we are able to derive a quantum mechanical description of supersymmetric
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. A supersymmetric index calculation provides
evidence for this conjecture. The quantum mechanical system becomes two
decoupled conformal quantum mechanical systems in the low energy limit. The
conformal quantum mechanics has expected properties of a dual description of
string theory on $AdS_2\times S^2$.
