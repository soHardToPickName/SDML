Fusion rules for N=2 superconformal modules
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we calculate the fusion coefficients for minimal series
representations of the N=2 superconformal algebra by using a modified
Verlinde's formula, and obtain associative and commutative fusion algebras with
non-negative integral fusion coefficients at each level. Some references are
added.
