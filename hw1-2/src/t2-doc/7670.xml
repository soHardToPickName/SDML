Purely Transmitting Defect Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We define an infinite class of integrable theories with a defect which are
formulated as chiral defect perturbations of a conformal field theory. Such
theories can be interacting in the bulk, and are purely transmitting through
the defect. The examples of the sine-Gordon theory and Ising model are worked
out in some detail.
