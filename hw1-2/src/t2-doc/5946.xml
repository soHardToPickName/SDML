Quantization of Gauge Theories with Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk, we briefly review the basic concepts of anomalous gauge
theories. It has been known for some time how theories with local anomalies can
be handled. Recently it has been pointed out that global anomalies, which
obstruct the quantization of certain gauge theories in the temporal gauge, get
bypassed in canonical quantization.
