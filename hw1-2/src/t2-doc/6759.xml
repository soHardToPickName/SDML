p-p' System with B Field and Projection Operator Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the system of the Dp'-brane with Dp-brane (p<p') inside, in the case
where B_{ij} field is a nonvanishing constant. In order to understand how the
Dp-brane is viewed from the Dp'-brane worldvolume theory, we investigate the
process in which the Dp-brane is probed with p'-p' open string. We calculate
the scattering amplitudes among p-p' open strings and p'-p' open strings and
show that not only the Weyl transform of the projection operator onto the
ground state but also those onto higher excited states emerge as multiplicative
factors of the amplitudes.
