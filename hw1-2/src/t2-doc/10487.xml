Ultraquantum Dynamics

<abstract>
  Segal proposed ultraquantum commutation relations with two ultraquantum
constants hbar' and hbar'' besides Planck's quantum constant hbar with a
variable i. The Heisenberg quantum algebra is a contraction - in a more general
sense than that of Inonu and Wigner - of the Segal ultraquantum algebra. The
usual constant i arises as a vacuum order-parameter in the quantum limit where
hbar' and hbar'' approach zero. One physical consequence is a discrete spectrum
for canonical variable and space-time coordinates. Another is an
interconvention of time and energy accompnying space-time meltdown (disorder),
with a fundamental conversion factor of some kilograms of energy per second.
