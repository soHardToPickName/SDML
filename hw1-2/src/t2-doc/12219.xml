Gaussian Wavefunctional Approach in Thermofield Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The Gaussian wavefunctional approach is developed in thermofield dynamics. We
manufacture thermal vacuum wavefunctional, its creation as well as annihilation
operators,and accordingly thermo-particle excited states. For a
(D+1)-dimensional scalar field system with an arbitrary potential whose Fourier
representation exists in a sense of tempered distributions, we calculate the
finite temperature Gaussian effective potential (FTGEP), one- and
two-thermo-particle-state energies. The zero-temperature limit of each of them
is just the corresponding result in quantum field theory, and the FTGEP can
lead to the same one of each of some concrete models as calculated by the
imaginary time Green function.
