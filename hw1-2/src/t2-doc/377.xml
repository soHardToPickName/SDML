Elliptic solutions of the Skyrme model
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of exact solutions of the Skyrme model are obtained. They are
described by the Weierstrass $\wp$-function or the Jacobi elliptic function.
They are not solitonic but of wave character. They supply us with examples of
the superposition of three plane waves in the Skyrme model.
