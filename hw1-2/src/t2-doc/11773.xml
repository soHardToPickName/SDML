Poisson-Lie T-duality in N=2 Superconformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric generalization of Poisson-Lie T-duality in superconformal
WZNW models is considered. It is shown that the classical N=2 superconformal
WZNW models posses a natural Poisson-Lie symmetry which allows to construct
dual $\sigma$- models.
