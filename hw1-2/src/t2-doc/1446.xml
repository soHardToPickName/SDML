Para-Statistics as Lie-super Triple Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We first reformulate para-statistics in terms of Lie-super triple systems. In
this way, we reproduce various new kinds of para-statistics discovered recently
by Palev in addition to the standard one. Also, bosonic and fermionic operators
may not necessarily commute with each other.
