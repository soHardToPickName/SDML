Hamiltonian BRST Quantization of the Conformal Spinning String
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian BRST quantization of the null spinning string for different
number of supersymmetries is given. A null spinning string with manifest
space-time conformal invariance is constructed. Its Brst quantization gives
negative critical dimension for $N\neq 0$ and reproduces previous results for
$N=0$.
