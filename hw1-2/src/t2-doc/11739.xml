Radiation reaction in various dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the radiation reaction problem for an electric charge moving in
flat space-time of arbitrary dimensions. It is shown that four is the unique
dimension where a local differential equation exists accounting for the
radiation reaction and admitting a consistent mass-renormalization (the
Dirac-Lorentz equation). In odd dimensions the Huygens principle does not hold;
as a result, the radiation reaction force depends on the whole past history of
a charge (radiative tail). We show that the divergence in the tail integral can
be removed by the mass renormalization only in the 2+1 theory. In even
dimensions higher than four, divergences can not be removed by a
renormalization.
