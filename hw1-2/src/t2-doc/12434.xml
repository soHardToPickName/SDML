Isolated vacua in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit proof of the existence of nontrivial vacua in the pure
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with higher orthogonal SO(N), N>=7 or the
G_2 gauge group defined on a 3-torus with periodic boundary conditions is
given. Extra vacuum states are separated by an energy barrier from the
perturbative vacuum A_i=0 and its gauge copies.
