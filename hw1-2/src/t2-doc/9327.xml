Holography and Rotating AdS Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We probe the AdS/CFT correspondence by comparing the thermodynamics of a
rotating black hole in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space with that of a
conformal field theory on $S^3$, whose parameters come from the boundary of
spacetime. In the high temperature limit, we find agreement between gauge
theory and gravity in all thermodynamic quantities upto the same factor of 4/3
that appears for nonrotating holes.
