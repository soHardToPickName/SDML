Hairy Black Holes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Solutions of bosonic string theory are constructed which correspond to
four-dimensional black holes with axionic quantum hair. The basic building
blocks are the renormalization group flows of the CP1 model with a theta term
and the SU(1,1)/U(1) WZW coset conformal field theory. However the solutions
are also found to have negative energy excitations, and are accordingly
expected to decay to the vacuum.
