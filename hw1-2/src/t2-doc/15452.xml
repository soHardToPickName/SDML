The Qubits of Qunivac
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a theory of quantum processes, extend it to a generic quantum
cosmology, formulate a reversible quantum logic for the Quantum Universe As
Computer, or Qunivac. Qunivac has an orthogonal group of cosmic dimensionality.
It has a Clifford algebra of ``cosmonions,'' extending the quaternions to a
cosmological number of anticommuting units. Its qubits obey Clifford-Wilczek
statistics and are associated with unit cosmonions. This makes it relatively
easy to program the Dirac equation on Qunivac in a Lorentz-invariant way.
Qunivac accommodates a field theory and a gauge theory. Its gauge group is
necessarily a quantum group.
