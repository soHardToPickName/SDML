Vacuum properties of a Non-Local Thirring-Like Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We use path-integral methods to analyze the vacuum properties of a recently
proposed extension of the Thirring model in which the interaction between
fermionic currents is non-local. We calculate the exact ground state wave
functional of the model for any bilocal potential, and also study its
long-distance behavior. We show that the ground state wave functional has a
general factored Jastrow form. We also find that it posess an interesting
symmetry involving the interchange of density-density and current-current
interactions.
