Family of Boundary Poisson Brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a new d-parameter family of ultra-local boundary Poisson brackets
that satisfy the Jacobi identity. The two already known cases (hep-th/9305133,
hep-th/9806249 and hep-th/9901112) of ultra-local boundary Poisson brackets are
included in this new continuous family as special cases.
