The SU(2) Skyrme model and anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  The SU(2) Skyrme model,expanding in the collective coordinates variables,
gives rise to second-class constraints. Recently this system was embedded in a
more general Abelian gauge theory using the BFFT Hamiltonian method. In this
work we quantize this gauge theory computing the Noether current anomaly using
for this two different methods: an operatorial Dirac first class formalism and
the non-local BV quantization coupled with the Fujikawa regularization
procedure.
