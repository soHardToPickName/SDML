Quenched Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effects of quenching in Super-Yang-Mills theory. While
supersymmetry is broken, the lagrangian acquires a new flavour U(1 | 1)
symmetry. The anomaly structure thus differs from the unquenched case. We
derive the corresponding low-energy effective lagrangian. As a consequence, we
predict the mass splitting expected in numerical simulations for particles
belonging to the lowest-lying supermultiplet. An estimate of the systematic
error due to quenching follows.
