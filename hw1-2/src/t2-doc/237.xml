Towards chaos criterion in quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Chaos criterion for quantum field theory is proposed. Its correspondence with
classical chaos criterion in semi-classical regime is shown. It is demonstrated
for real scalar field that proposed chaos criterion can be used to investigate
stability of classical solutions of field equations.
