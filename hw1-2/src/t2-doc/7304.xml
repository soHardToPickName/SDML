Maximally localized states and causality in non commutative quantum
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We give simple representations for quantum theories in which the position
commutators are non vanishing constants. A particular representation reproduces
results found using the Moyal star product. The notion of exact localization
being meaningless in these theories, we adapt the notion of ``maximally
localized states'' developed in another context . We find that gaussian
functions play this role in a 2+1 dimensional model in which the non
commutation relations concern positions only. An interpretation of the wave
function in this non commutative geometry is suggested. We also analyze higher
dimensional cases. A possible incidence on the causality issue for a Q.F.T with
a non commuting time is sketched.
