Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangians of minimal $W$-models with an integrable
  perturbation
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangians for minimal bosonic ($N=0$)
$W$-models perturbed with the least relevant field, inspired by the theory of
$N=2$ supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg Lagrangians. They agree with the
Lagrangians for unperturbed models previously found with Zamolodchikov's
method. We briefly study their properties, e.g. the perturbation algebra and
the soliton structure. We conclude that the known properties of $N=2$ solitons
(BPS, lines in $W$ plane, etc.) hold as well. Hence, a connection with a
generalized supersymmetric structure of minimal $W$-models is conjectured.
