Two-Dimensional Quantum Poincar\'E Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Poincar\'e-Weyl group in two dimensional quantum Minkowski space-time
is considered and an appriopriate relativistic kinematics is investigated. It
is claimed that a consistent approach to the above questions demands a kind of
a ``quantum geometry'' in the $q$-deformed space-time.
