Renormalization Group with Condensate
</title>

<abstract>
  The renormalization group is applied to the phi4 model in the symmetry broken
phase in order to identify different scaling regimes. The new scaling laws
reflect nonuniversal behavior at the phase transition. The extension of the
analysis to finite temperature is briefly outlined. It is mentioned that the
coupling constants can be found in the mixed phase by taking into account the
saddle points of the blocking procedure.
