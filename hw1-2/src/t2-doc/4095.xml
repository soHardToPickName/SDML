Constant magnetic field and 2d non-commutative inverted oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a two-dimensional non-commutative inverted oscillator in the
presence of a constant magnetic field, coupled to the system in a
``symplectic'' and ``Poisson'' way. We show that it has a discrete energy
spectrum for some value of the magnetic field.
