On relations between vertex operators, quasiclassical operators, and
  phase space coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  For certain situations we give a geometrical background for quasiclassical KP
calculations based on an explicit connection to quantum mechanics and the
collapse of coherent states to coadjoint orbits for classical operators.
