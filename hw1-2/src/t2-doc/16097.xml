Sine-Gordon Equation and Representations of Affine Kac-Moody Algebra
  \hat{sl_2}

<abstract>
  The goal of this paper is to give a representation-theoretic interpretation
of the sine-Gordon equation. We consider a vertex operator representation of
affine Kac-Moody algebra \hat{sl_2} on the space of differential operators. In
this formulation, the tau-function becomes a function of non-commuting
variables. Using the skew Casimir operators, we obtain a hierarchy of equations
in Hirota form that contains sine-Gordon, KdV and mKdV equations and construct
their soliton solutions.
