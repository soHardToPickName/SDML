Exponent of n-Ising matter fields coupled to 2d gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  n-Ising spins on a random surface represented by a matrix model is studied as
a model of the 2D gravity coupled to matter field with the central charge c >
1. The magnetic field is introduced to discuss the scaling exponent $\Delta$,
and the value of this magnetic field exponent is estimated by the series
expansion.
