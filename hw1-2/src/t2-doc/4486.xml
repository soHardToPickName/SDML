Matrix Versions of the Calogero Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Matrix generalizations of the N-particle quantum-mechanical Calogero model
classifying according to representations of the symmetric group $S_N$ are
considered. Symmetry properties of the eigen-wave functions in the matrix
Calogero models are analyzed. Latex.
