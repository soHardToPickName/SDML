Projectors for the fuzzy sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  All fiber bundle with a given set of characteristic classes are viewable as
particular projections of a more general bundle called a universal classifying
space. This notion of projector valued field, a global definition of
connections and gauge fields, can be useful to define vector bundles for non
commutative base spaces. In this paper we derive the projector valued field for
the fuzzy sphere, defining non-commutative n-monopole configurations, and check
that in the classical limit, using the machinery of non-commutative geometry,
the corresponding topological charges (Chern class) are integers.
