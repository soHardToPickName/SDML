Effective Action - A Convergent Series - of QED
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective action of QED obtained by Euler and Heisenberg and by
Schwinger has been expressed by an asymptotic perturbative series which is
divergent. In this letter we present a non-perturbative but convergent series
of the effective action. With the convergent series we establish the existence
of the manifest electric-magnetic duality in the one loop effective action of
QED.
