Static Potential in N=4 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the leading order perturbative correction to the static potential
in ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We show that the perturbative
expansion contains infrared logarithms which, when resummed, become logarithms
of the coupling constant. The resulting correction goes in the right direction
to match the strong coupling behavior obtained from the AdS/CFT correspondence.
We find that the strong coupling extrapolation of the sum of ladder diagrams
goes as $\sqrt{g^2N}$, as in the supergravity approach.
