M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds with background flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform the Kaluza-Klein reduction of M-theory on warped Calabi-Yau
fourfolds with non-trivial four-form flux turned on. The resulting scalar- and
superpotential is computed and compared with the superpotential obtained by
Gukov, Vafa and Witten using different methods.
