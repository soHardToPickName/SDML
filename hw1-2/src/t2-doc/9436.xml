DeDonder-Weyl theory and a hypercomplex extension of quantum mechanics
  to field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantization of field theory based on the DeDonder-Weyl covariant
Hamiltonian formulation is discussed. A hypercomplex extension of quantum
mechanics, in which the space-time Clifford algebra replaces that of the
complex numbers, appears as a result of quantization of Poisson brackets of
differential forms put forward for the DeDonder-Weyl formulation earlier. The
proposed covariant hypercomplex Schr\"odinger equation is shown to lead in the
classical limit to the DeDonder-Weyl Hamilton-Jacobi equation and to obey the
Ehrenfest principle in the sense that the DeDonder-Weyl canonical field
equations are satisfied for the expectation values of properly chosen
operators.
