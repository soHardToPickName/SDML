Topological phase transitions in two-dimensional systems with internal
  symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Possible generalizations of the topological (or
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless) phase transition on multicomponent 2D systems
with nontrivial vector homotopic group pi_1 are considered. Relations between
Ginzburg-Landau like theories, non-linear sigma-models on maximal Cartan
subgroups of simple compact Lie groups and generalized sine-Gordon type
theories are discussed. D-dimensional non-linear sigma-model admitting
topological excitations with logarithmic energies are constructed.
