Canonical quantization of the degenerate WZ action including chiral
  interaction with gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Canonical quantization of the Wess-Zumino (WZ) model including chiral
interaction with gauge field is considered for the case of a degenerate action.
The two-dimensional SU(2) Yang-Mills model and the four-dimensional SU(3)
chiral gauge model proposed in the paper \cite{fss} are studied in details.
Gauge invariance of the quantum theory is established at the formal level.
