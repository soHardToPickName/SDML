Quantization of Noncommutative Scalar Solitons at finite $\theta$
</title>

<abstract>
  We start by discussing the classical noncommutative (NC) Q-ball solutions
near the commutative limit, then generalize the virial relation. Next we
quantize the NC Q-ball canonically. At very small theta quantum correction to
the energy of the Q-balls is calculated through summation of the phase shift.
UV/IR mixing terms are found in the quantum corrections which cannot be
renormalized away. The same method is generalized to the NC GMS soliton for the
smooth enough solution. UV/IR mixing is also found in the energy correction and
UV divergence is shown to be absent. In this paper only (2+1) dimensional
scalar field theory is discussed.
