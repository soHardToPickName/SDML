Equivalence of Geometric h<1/2 and Standard c>25 Approaches to
  Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show equivalence between the standard weak coupling regime c>25 of the
two-dimensional quantum gravity and regime h<1/2 of the original geometric
approach of Polyakov [1,2], developed in [3,4,5].
