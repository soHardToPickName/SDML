Subfactors and coset models
</title>

<abstract>
  Some facts about von Neumann algebras and finite index inclusions of factors
are viewed in the context of local quantum field theory. The possibility of
local fields intertwining superselection sectors with braid group statistics is
explored. Conformal embeddings and coset models serve as examples. The
associated symmetry concept is pointed out.
