Hard Thermal Loops, Chern-Simons Theory and the Quark-Gluon Plasma
</title>

<abstract>
  The generating functional for hard thermal loops in QCD is important in
setting up a resummed perturbation theory. I review how this functional is
related to the eikonal for a Chern-Simons theory, and using an auxiliary field,
to the gauged WZNW-action. The induced current due to hard thermal loops,
properly incorporating damping effects, is also briefly discussed. (Invited
talk at the Third Worshop on Thermal Field Theories, Banff, Canada, August,
1993.)
