A bijection which implies Melzer's polynomial identities: the
  $\chi_{1,1}^{(p,p+1)}$ case
</title>

<abstract>
We obtain a bijection between certain lattice paths and partitions. This
implies a proof of polynomial identities conjectured by Melzer. In a limit,
these identities reduce to Rogers--Ramanujan-type identities for the
$\chi_{1,1}^{(p,p+1)}(q)$ Virasoro characters, conjectured by the Stony Brook
group.
