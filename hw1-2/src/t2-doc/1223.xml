Renormalizability of Quantum Gravity near Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the renormalizability of quantum gravity near two dimensions. Our
formalism starts with the tree action which is invariant under the volume
preserving diffeomorphism. We identify the BRS invariance which originates from
the full diffeomorphism invariance. We study the Ward-Takahashi identities to
determine the general structure of the counter terms. We prove to all orders
that the counter terms can be supplied by the coupling and the wave function
renormalization of the tree action. The bare action can be constructed to be
the Einstein action form which ensures the full diffeomorphism invariance.
