Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebra for Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give arguments for the necessity to employ Quantum Clifford Hopf Gebras in
quantum field theory. The role of the antipode is examined, Feynman diagrams
are re-interpreted as tangles of graphical calculus. Regularization due to the
design of convolution Hopf gebras is given as a program for further research.
