Trace anomaly of the conformal gauge field
</title>

<abstract>
  The proposed by Bastianelli and van Nieuwenhuizen new method of calculations
of trace anomalies is applied in the conformal gauge field case. The result is
then reproduced by the heat equation method. An error in previous calculation
is corrected. It is pointed out that the introducing gauge symmetries into a
given system by a field-enlarging transformation can result in unexpected
quantum effects even for trivial configurations.
