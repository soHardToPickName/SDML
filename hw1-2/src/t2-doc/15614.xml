Soliton Gauge States and T-duality of Closed Bosonic String Compatified
  on Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We study soliton gauge states in the spectrum of bosonic string compatified
on torus. The enhenced Kac-Moody gauge symmetry, and thus T-duality, is shown
to be related to the existence of these soliton gauge states in some moduli
points.
