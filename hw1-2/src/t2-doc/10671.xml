Consistent and covriant anomalies in the overlap formulation of chiral
  gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we show how the covariant anomaly emerges in the overlap
scheme. We also prove that the overlap scheme correctly reproduces the anomaly
in the flavour currents such as $j^5_\mu$ in vector like theories like QCD.
