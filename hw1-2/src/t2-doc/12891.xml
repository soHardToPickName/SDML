Functional Approach to Phase Space Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present BRST gauge fixing approach to quantum mechanics in phase space.
The theory is obtained by $\hbar$-deformation of the cohomological classical
mechanics described by d=1, N=2 model. We use the extended phase space supplied
by the path integral formulation with $\hbar$-deformed symplectic structure.
