Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We find classically stable solitons (instantons) in odd (even) dimensional
scalar noncommutative field theories whose scalar potential, $V(\ph)$, has at
least two minima. These solutions are bubbles of the false vacuum whose size is
set by the scale of noncommutativity. Our construction uses the correspondence
between non-commutative fields and operators on a single particle Hilbert
space. In the case of noncommutative gauge theories we note that expanding
around a simple solution shifts away the kinetic term and results in a purely
quartic action with linearly realised gauge symmetries.
