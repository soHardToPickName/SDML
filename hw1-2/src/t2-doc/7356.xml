Towards Finite Quantum Field Theory in Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the self-interacting scalar field on the truncated sphere and we
perform the quantization using the functional (path) integral approach. The
theory posseses a full symmetry with respect to the isometries of the sphere.
We explicitely show that the model is finite and the UV-regularization
automatically takes place.
