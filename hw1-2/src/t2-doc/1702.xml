Gauss-Bonnet interaction in Randall-Sundrum compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Gauss-Bonnet term is the only consistent curvature squared
interaction in the Randall-Sundrum model and various static and inflationary
solutions can be found. And from metric perturbations around the RS background
with a single brane embedded, we also show that for a vanishing Gauss-Bonnet
coefficient, the brane bending allows us to reproduce the 4D Einstein gravity
at the linearized level.
