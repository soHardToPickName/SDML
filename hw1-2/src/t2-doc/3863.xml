Fermionic Coset Realization of the Critical Ising Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain an explicit realization of all the primary fields of the Ising
model in terms of a conformal field theory of constrained fermions. The
four-point correlators of the energy, order and disorder operators are
explicitly calculated.
