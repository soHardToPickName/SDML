Summary of Results in N=1 Supersymmetric SU(2) Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize some results in 4d, N=1 supersymmetric SU(2) gauge theories: the
exact effective superpotentials, the vacuum structure, and the exact effective
Abelian couplings for arbitrary bare masses and Yukawa couplings.
