All Loop N=2 String Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the N=4 topological reformulation of N=2 strings, we compute all loop
partition function for special compactifications of N=2 strings as a function
of target moduli. We also reinterpret N=4 topological amplitudes in terms of
slightly modified N=2 topological amplitudes. We present some preliminary
evidence for the conjecture that N=2 strings is the large N limit of
Holomorphic Yang-Mills in 4 dimensions.
