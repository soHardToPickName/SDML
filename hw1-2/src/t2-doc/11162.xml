Statistics in the Propositional Formulation of Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a definition for the notion of statistics in the lattice-theoretical
(or propositional) formulation of quantum mechanics of Birchoff, von Neumann
and Piron. We show that this formalism is compatible only with two types of
statistics: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac. Some comments are made about the
connection between this result and the existence of exotic statistics
(para-statistics, infinite statistics, braid statistics).
