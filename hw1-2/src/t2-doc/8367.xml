Type IIB Random Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider random superstrings of type IIB in $d$-dimensional space. The
discretized action is constructed from the supersymetric matrix model, which
has been proposed as a constructive definition of superstring theory. Our
action is invariant under the local N=2 super transformations, and doesn't have
any redundant fermionic degrees of freedom.
