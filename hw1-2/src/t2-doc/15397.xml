Integrals of Motion for Kicked Quantum Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalised quasienergy states are introduced as eigenstates of the new
integral of motion for periodically and nonperiodically kicked quantum
systems.The photon distribution function of polymode generalised correlated
light expressed in terms of multivariable Hermite polynomials is discussed and
the relation of its properties to Schrodinger uncertainty relation is given.
