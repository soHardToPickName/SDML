On U(1)-charged domain walls
</title>

<abstract>
  A classical field system of two interacting fields -- a real Higgs field and
a complex scalar field -- is considered. It is shown that in such field system
a non-trivial solution exists, which is U(1) charged topological kink. Some
questions of stability of the obtained solution are discussed. An improved
variational procedure for searching of topological U(1) charged solutions is
given.
