Frenet-Serret vacuum radiation, detection proposals and related topics
</title>

<abstract>
  The paradigmatic Unruh radiation is an ideal and simple case of stationary
vacuum radiation patterns related to worldlines defined as Frenet-Serret
curves. We review the corresponding body of literature as well as the
experimental proposals that have been suggested to detect these types of
quantum field radiation patterns. Finally, we comment on a few other topics
related to the Unruh effect
