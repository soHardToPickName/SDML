On Type IIA String Theory on the PP-wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study type IIA superstring theory on a PP-wave background with 24
supercharges. This model can exactly be solved and then quantized. The open
string in this PP-wave background is also studied. We observe that the theory
has supersymmetric Dp-branes for p=2,4,6,8.
