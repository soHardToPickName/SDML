Veneziano Amplitude for Winding Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  String configurations with nonzero winding number describe soliton string
states. We compute the Veneziano amplitude for the scattering of arbitrary
winding states and show that in the large radius limit the strings always
scatter trivially and with no change in the individual winding numbers of the
strings. In this limit, then, these states scatter as true solitons.
