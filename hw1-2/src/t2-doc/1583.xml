A note on the non-commutative Chern-Simons model on manifolds with
  boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  We study field theories defined in regions of the spatial non-commutative
(NC) plane with a boundary present delimiting them, concentrating in particular
on the U(1) NC Chern-Simons theory on the upper half plane. We find that
classical consistency and gauge invariance lead necessary to the introduction
of $K_0$-space of square integrable functions null together with all their
derivatives at the origin. Furthermore the requirement of closure of $K_0$
under the *-product leads to the introduction of a novel notion of the
*-product itself in regions where a boundary is present, that in turn yields
the complexification of the gauge group and to consider chiral waves in one
sense or other. The canonical quantization of the theory is sketched
identifying the physical states and the physical operators. These last ones
include ordinary NC Wilson lines starting and ending on the boundary that yield
correlation functions depending on points on the one-dimensional boundary. We
finally extend the definition of the *-product to a strip and comment on
possible relevance of these results to finite Quantum Hall systems.
