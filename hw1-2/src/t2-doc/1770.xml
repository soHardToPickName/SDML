Probing Naked Singularities in Non-supersymmetric String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a detailed analysis of non-supersymmetric spacetime varying string
vacua which can lead to an exponential hierarchy between the electroweak and
the gravitational scales. In particular, we identify a limit in which these
vacua can be interpreted as supersymmetric vacua of F-theory. Furthermore, we
study the properties of these solutions as seen by $D7$-brane probes and
establish a non-supersymmetric analogue of the enhancon mechanism.
