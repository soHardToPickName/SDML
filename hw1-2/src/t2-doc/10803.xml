Effectiveness of One-dimensional gas models for black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A one-dimensional gas model has been constructed and shown to provide correct
expressions for entropies for extremal and near-extremal BTZ black holes.
Recently suggested boosting of black strings is used to compute the entropy for
the Schwarzschild black hole also from this gas model.
