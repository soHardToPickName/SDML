An Approach to ${\cal N}=4$ ADE Gauge Theory on K3
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a recipe for determination of the partition function of ${\cal
N}=4$ $ADE$ gauge theory on $K3$ by generalizing our previous results of the
SU(N) case. The resulting partition function satisfies Montonen-Olive duality
for $ADE $ gauge group.
