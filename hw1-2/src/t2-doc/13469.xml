On Integrable Models Related to the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We define the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin algebra and consider integrable models
described by it. The models include the $osp(1,2)$ Gaudin magnet and the Dicke
model related to it. Detailed discussion of the simplest cases of these models
is presented. The effect of the presence of fermions on the separation of
variables is indicated.
