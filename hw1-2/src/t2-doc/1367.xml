The Identity String Field and the Tachyon Vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the triviality of the entire cohomology of the new BRST operator
Q around the tachyon vacuum is equivalent to the Q-exactness of the identity I
of the star-algebra. We use level truncation to show that as the level is
increased, the identity becomes more accurately Q-exact. We carry our
computations up to level nine, where an accuracy of 3% is attained. Our work
supports, under a new light, Sen's conjecture concerning the absence of open
string degrees of freedom around the tachyon vacuum. As a by-product, a new and
simple expression for I in terms of Virasoro operators is found.
