Entropy and Area
</title>

<abstract>
  The ground state density matrix for a massless free field is traced over the
degrees of freedom residing inside an imaginary sphere; the resulting entropy
is shown to be proportional to the area (and not the volume) of the sphere.
Possible connections with the physics of black holes are discussed.
