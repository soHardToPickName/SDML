Localization of Gravitino on a Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the spin 3/2 gravitino field can be localized on a brane in a
general framework of supergravity theory. Provided that a scalar field coupled
to the Rarita-Schwinger field develops an vacuum expectation value (VEV) whose
phase depends on the 'radial' coordinate in extra internal space, the gravitino
is localized on a brane with the exponentially decreasing warp factor by
selecting an appropriate value of the VEV.
