On the geometry of higher-spin gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a recent construction of the free field equations for totally
symmetric tensors and tensor-spinors that exhibits the corresponding linearized
geometry. These equations are not local for all spins >2, involve unconstrained
fields and gauge parameters, rest on the curvatures introduced long ago by de
Wit and Freedman, and reduce to the local (Fang-)Fronsdal form upon partial
gauge fixing. We also describe how the higher-spin geometry is realized in free
String Field Theory, and how the gauge fixing to the light cone can be
effected.
