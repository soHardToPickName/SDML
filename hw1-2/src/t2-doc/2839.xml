Noncommutative probability, matrix models, and quantum orbifold
  spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  Inspired by the intimate relationship between Voiculescu's noncommutative
probability (of type A) and large-N matrix models in physics, we look for
physical models related to noncommutative probability theory of type B. These
turn out to be fermionic matrix-vector models at the double large-N limit. They
describe different quantum orbifold spacetimes with boundaries. Their critical
exponents coincide with that of ordinary quantum spacetime, but their
renormalised tree-level one-boundary amplitudes differ.
