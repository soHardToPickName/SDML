Phase Transition and Absence Of Ghosts in Rigid QED
</title>

<abstract>
  Ordinary QED formulated in the Feynman's space-time picture is equivalent to
a one dimensional field theory. In the large N limit there is no phase
transition in such a theory. In this letter, we show a phase transition does
exist in a generalization of QED characterized by the addition of the curvature
of the world line (rigidity) to the Feynman's space-time action. The large
distance scale of the disordered phase essentially coincides with ordinary QED,
while the ordered phase is strongly coupled. Although rigid QED exhibits the
typical pathologies of higher derivative theories at the classical level, we
show that both phases of the quantum theory are free of ghosts and tachyons.
Quantum fluctuations prevent taking the naive classical limit and inherting the
problems of the classical theory.
