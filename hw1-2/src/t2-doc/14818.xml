T-duality in M-theory and supermembranes
</title>

<abstract>
  The (q_1,q_2) SL(2,Z) string bound states of type IIB superstring theory
admit two inequivalent (T-dual) representations in eleven dimensions in terms
of a fundamental 2-brane. In both cases, the spectrum of membrane oscillations
can be determined exactly in the limit $g^2\to \infty $, where $g^2$ is the
type IIA string coupling. We find that the BPS mass formulas agree, and
reproduce the BPS mass spectrum of the $(q_1,q_2)$ string bound state. In the
non-BPS sector, the respective mass formulas apply in different corners of the
moduli space. The axiomatic requirement of T-duality in M-theory permits to
derive a discrete mass spectrum in a (thin torus) region where standard
supermembrane theory undergoes instabilities.
