Three-Point Functions of Chiral Operators in D=4, $\CN=4$ SYM at Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  We study all three-point functions of normalized chiral operators in D=4,
$\CN=4$, U(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit. We
compute them for small 't Hooft coupling $\lambda=g_{YM}^2N<<1$ using free
field theory and at strong coupling $\lambda=g_{YM}^2>>1$ using the $AdS$/CFT
correspondence. Surprisingly, we find the same answers in the two limits. We
conjecture that at least for large $N$ the exact answers are independent of
$\lambda $ .
