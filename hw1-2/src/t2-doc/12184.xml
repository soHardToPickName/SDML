Perturbative Aspects of q-Deformed Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of the q-deformed Heisenberg algebra a dynamical
equation of q-deformed quantum mechanics is discussed. The perturbative aspects
of the q-deformed Schr\"odinger equation are analyzed. General representations
of the additional momentum-dependent interaction originating from the
q-deformed effects are presented in two approaches. As examples, such
additional interactions related to the harmonic-oscillator potential and the
Morse potential are demonstrated.
