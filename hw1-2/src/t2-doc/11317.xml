D2-branes with magnetic flux in the presence of RR fields
</title>

<abstract>
  D2-branes are studied in the context of Born-Infeld theory as a source of the
3-form RR gauge potential. Considering the static case with only a radial
magnetic field it is shown that a locally stable hemispherical deformation of
the brane exists which minimises the energy locally. Since the D2-brane carries
also the charge of D0-branes, and the RR spacetime potential is unbounded from
below, these can tunnel to condense on the D2-brane. The corresponding
instanton-like configuration and the tunneling rate are derived and discussed.
