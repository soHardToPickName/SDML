Absorption of Fermions by D3-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The absorption cross section of dilatinos by D3-branes is calculated by means
of both classical type IIB supergravity and the effective gauge field theory on
their worldvolume. The two methods give the same results, supporting the
microscopic description of black holes in terms of D-branes and giving another
evidence of AdS/superconformal reciprocity.
