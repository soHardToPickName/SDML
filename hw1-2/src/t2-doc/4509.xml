On the antipode of Kreimer's Hopf algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a new formula for the antipode of the algebra of rooted trees,
directly in terms of the bialgebra structure. The equivalence, proved in this
paper, among the three available formulae for the antipode, reflects the
equivalence among the Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp, Zimmermann, and Dyson-Salam
renormalization schemes.
