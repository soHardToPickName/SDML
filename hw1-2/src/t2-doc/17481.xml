M-momentum Transfer between Gravitons, Membranes, and Fivebranes as
  Perturbative Gauge Theory Processes
</title>

<abstract>
  Polchinski and Pouliot have shown that M-momentum transfer between membranes
in supergravity can be understood as a non-perturbative instanton effect in
gauge theory. Here we consider a dual process: electric flux transmission
between D-branes. We show that this process can be described in perturbation
theory as virtual string pair creation, and is closely related to Schwinger's
treatment of the pair creation of charged particles in a uniform electric
field. Through the application of dualities, our perturbative calculation gives
results for various non-perturbative amplitudes, including M-momentum transfer
between gravitons, membranes, and longitudinal fivebranes. Thus perturbation
theory plus dualities are sufficient to demonstrate agreement between
supergravity and gauge theory for a number of M-momentum transferring
processes. A variety of other processes where branes are transmitted between
branes, e.g. (p,q)-string transmission in IIB-theory, can also be studied. We
discuss the implications of our results for proving the 11 dimensional Lorentz
invariance of Matrix theory.
