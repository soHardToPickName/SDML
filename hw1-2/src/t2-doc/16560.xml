Asymptotic black hole quasinormal frequencies
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a simple derivation of the quasinormal frequencies of Schwarzschild
black holes in d>=4 and non-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in d=4, in
the limit of infinite damping. For Schwarzschild in d=4 we find that the
asymptotic real part of the frequency is (T_Hawking)log|1+2cos(pi.j)|, where j
is the spin of the perturbation; this confirms a result previously obtained by
other means. For Schwarzschild in d>4 we find that the asymptotic real part is
(T_Hawking)log(3) for scalar perturbations and for some gravitational
perturbations. For non-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom in d=4 we find a specific
generally aperiodic behavior for the quasinormal frequencies, both for scalar
perturbations and for axial electromagnetic-gravitational perturbations. The
formulae are obtained by studying the monodromy of the perturbation
analytically continued to the complex plane; the analysis depends essentially
on the behavior of the potential in the "unphysical" region near the black hole
singularity.
