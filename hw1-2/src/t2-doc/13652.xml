OPE formulae for deformed super-Virasoro algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the OPE formulae for three types of deformed super-Virasoro algebras:
Chaichian-Presnajder's deformation, Belov-Chaltikhian's one and its modified
version. Fundamental (anti-)commutation relations toward a ghost realization of
deformed super-Virasoro algebra are also discussed.
