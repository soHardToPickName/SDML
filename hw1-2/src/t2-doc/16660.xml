The Untruncated Marinari-Parisi Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the bosonic angular degrees of freedom in the one
dimensional Marinari-Parisi superstring can be integrated out exactly in the
Hamiltonian formulation without having to perform the Dabholkar truncation. The
resulting Hamiltonian is that of a supersymmetric Calogero system plus a four
fermions interaction. This extra interaction vanishes for all physical states
with fermion number zero or one where supersymmetry is manifest. We confirm
that supersymmetry is nonperturbativly broken by instanton effects.
