Strings on Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct several examples of compactification of Type IIB theory on
orientifolds and discuss their duals. In six dimensions we obtain models with
$N=1$ supersymmetry, multiple tensor multiplets, and different gauge groups. In
nine dimensions we obtain a model that is dual to M-theory compactified on a
Klein bottle.
