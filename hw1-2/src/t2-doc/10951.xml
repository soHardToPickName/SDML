Derivative corrections to Dirac-Born-Infeld and Chern-Simon actions from
  Non-commutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the higher order derivative $\alpha^{'}$ corrections to the DBI
and Chern-Simon action is derived from non-commutativity in the Seiberg-Witten
limit, and is shown to agree with Wyllard's (hep-th/0008125) result, as
conjectured by Das et al., (hep-th/0106024). In calculating the corrections, we
have expressed $\hat F$ in terms F, $\hat A$ in terms of A up to order ${\cal
O}(A^3)$, and made use of it.
