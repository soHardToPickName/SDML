Infrared region of QCD and confining strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge field configurations appropriate for the infrared region of QCD are
proposed in a submanifold of $su(3)$. Some properties of the submanifold are
presented. Using the usual action for QCD, in the absense of quarks,
confinement of these configurations is realized as in the London theory of
Meissner effect. Choosing a representation for the monopole field strength, a
string action corresponding to the effective gauge theory action in the
infrared region, is obtained. This confining string action contains the
Nambu-Goto term, extrinsic curvature action and the Euler characteristic of the
string world sheet.
