Dilatonic Domain Walls and Curved Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Curved, intersecting brane configurations satisfying the type IIA
supergravity equations of motion are found. In eleven dimensions, the models
are interpreted in terms of orthogonally intersecting M5--branes, where the
world--volumes are curved due to the effects of one or more massless scalar
fields. Duality symmetries are employed to generate further type II and
heterotic solutions. Some cosmological implications are discussed.
