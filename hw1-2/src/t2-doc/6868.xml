Half-Branes, Singular Brane Intersections, and Kaluza-Klein reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  Two subtle aspects of brane intersections are investigated. The first
concerns the `half-branes' that arise in discussions of the Hanany-Witten
effect, often in the D0/D8 setting. The second involves the validity of
seemingly singular classical BPS brane intersections. A study of holomorphic
curves in the background of a Kaluza-Klein monopole and the associated
reduction to type IIA supergravity sheds light on both issues. Many seemingly
singular D2/D6 intersections are shown to lift to smooth configurations of
M2-branes in 11-dimensions, and a mechanism is found for certain $Z_2$
confinement effects in type II string theories that eliminates any need for
half-branes.
