Superfield approach to BRST cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of superfield formalism, we discuss some aspects of the
cohomological features of a two (1+1)-dimensional free Abelian gauge theory
described by a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) invariant Lagrangian density.
We demonstrate that the conserved and nilpotent (anti-)BRST- and (anti-)co-BRST
charges are the generators of translations along the Grassmannian directions of
the four (2+2)-dimensional supermanifold. A bosonic symmetry is shown to be
generated by a Noether conserved charge that generates a translation along a
bosonic direction of the supermanifold which turns out to be equivalent to a
couple of successive translations along the two different and independent
Grassmannian directions of the same supermanifold. Algebraically, these charges
are found to be analogous to the de Rham cohomology operators of differential
geometry.
