Electromagnetic Field from the Skyrme Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the model of topological fermions allowing for solitons with
integer multiples of elementary electric charges only. In the electromagnetic
limit the Lagrangean reduces to the Skyrme term of the Skyrme model with two
degrees of freedom only, two Goldstone bosons, corresponding to two
polarisations of photons. We derive the equations of motion and discuss their
relations with Maxwell's equations. It is shown that Coulomb and Lorentz forces
are a consequence of topology. Further, we relate the U(1) gauge invariance of
electrodynamics to the geometry of the soliton field, give a general relation
for the derivation of the soliton field from the field strength tensor in
electrodynamics and use this relation to express homogeneous electric fields in
terms of the soliton field.
