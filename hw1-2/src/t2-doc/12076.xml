Symplectic Quantization of the CP$^1$ Model with the Chern-Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  The symplectic formalism is fully employed to study the gauge-invariant
CP$^1$ model with the Chern-Simons term. We consistently accommodate the CP$^1$
constraint at the Lagrangian level according to this formalism.
