A time-discretized version of the Calogero-Moser model
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce an integrable time-discretized version of the classical
Calogero-Moser model, which goes to the original model in a continuum limit.
This discrete model is obtained from pole solutions of a discretized version of
the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation, leading to a finite-dimensional symplectic
mapping. Lax pair, symplectic structure and sufficient set of invariants of the
discrete Calogero-Moser model are constructed. The classical $r$-matrix is the
same as for the continuum model.
