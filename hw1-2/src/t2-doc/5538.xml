On S-Duality in Abelian Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  U(1) gauge theory on ${\bf R}^4$ is known to possess an electric-magnetic
duality symmetry that inverts the coupling constant and extends to an action of
$SL(2,{\bf Z})$. In this paper, the duality is studied on a general
four-manifold and it is shown that the partition function is not a
modular-invariant function but transforms as a modular form. This result plays
an essential role in determining a new low-energy interaction that arises when
N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is formulated on a four-manifold; the
determination of this interaction gives a new test of the solution of the model
and would enter in computations of the Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds
with $b_2^+\leq 1$. Certain other aspects of abelian duality, relevant to
matters such as the dependence of Donaldson invariants on the second
Stieffel-Whitney class, are also analyzed.
