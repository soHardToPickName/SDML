O(1/N^3) Conformal Bootstrap Solution of the SU(2) x SU(2)
  Nambu--Jona-Lasinio Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the full conformal bootstrap method an analytic expression is given in
d-dimensions for the anomalous dimension of the fermion at O(1/N^3) in a large
N expansion of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with SU(2) x SU(2) continuous
chiral symmetry.
