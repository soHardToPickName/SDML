Intermediate Volumes and the Role of Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  We review recent results for the low-lying glueball spectrum on the
three-sphere in intermediate volumes that incorporate instanton effects. The
latter are implemented through boundary conditions on the fundamental domain
obtained by minimising the norm of the gauge field along the gauge orbit.
Non-perturbative corrections due to the boundary conditions in field space are
seen to be crucial.
