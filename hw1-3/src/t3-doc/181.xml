<title>
Alternative to Higgs and Unification
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we discuss the self-consistency condition for the spherical
symmetric Klein-Gordon equation, and then discuss a natural possibility that
gravity and weak coupling constants g_G and g_W may be defined after g_{EM}. In
this point of view, gravity and the weak force are subsidiary derived from
electricity. Particularly, SU(2)_L * U(1) unification is derived without
assuming a phase transition.
 A possible origin of the Higgs mechanism is proposed. Each particle pair of
the standard model is associated with the corresponding asymptotic expansion of
an eigen function.
