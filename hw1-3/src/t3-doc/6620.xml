<title>
Does the Higgs mechanism favour electron-electron bound states in
  Maxwell-Chern-Simons QED_3?
</title>

<abstract>
  The low-energy electron-electron scattering potential is derived and
discussed for the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to QED_3 with spontaneous
symmetry breaking. One shows that the Higgs mechanism might favour
electron-electron bound states.
