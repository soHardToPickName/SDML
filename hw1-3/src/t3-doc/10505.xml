Noncommutative spin-1/2 representations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we apply the methods of our previous paper hep-th/0108045 to
noncommutative fermions. We show that the fermions form a spin-1/2
representation of the Lorentz algebra. The covariant splitting of the conformal
transformations into a field-dependent part and a \theta-part implies the
Seiberg-Witten differential equations for the fermions.
