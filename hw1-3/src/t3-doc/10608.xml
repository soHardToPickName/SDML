<title>
Birth of the Universe as quantum scattering in string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  In a Wheeler-de Witt approach to quantum string cosmology, the present state
of the Universe arises from the scattering and reflection of the wave function
representing the initial string vacuum in superspace. This scenario is
described and compared with the more conventional quantum cosmology picture, in
which the birth of the Universe is represented as a process of tunnelling "from
nothing" in superspace.
