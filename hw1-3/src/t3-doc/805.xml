<title>
Is the Higgs a visible particle ?
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest that the Higgs might be unobservable as a free particle, due to
its origin at a symmetry breaking mechanism. The standard model is kept intact,
only the definition of the vacuum for the Higgs is changed. With the new
(natural) definition, the Higgs propagator is half advanced and half retarded.
This Green function is compatible with the absence of free particles.
