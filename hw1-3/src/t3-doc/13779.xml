<title>
On the relations between correlation functions in SYM/pp-wave
  correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we establish the explicit relation between correlation functions
in ${\cal N} = 4$ SUSY Yang--Mills theory on $S^3\times R$ in a double scaling
limit and scattering amplitudes of the String Theory on the pp-wave background.
The relation is found for two-- and three--point correlation functions in these
theories. As a by product we formulate a dictionary for the correspondence
between these theories: in particular, we find some unknown relations between
the parameters in these theories. Furthermore, we argue that the String Theory
on the pp--wave background is related to four--dimensional SUSY Yang--Mills
theory rather than to the reduced matrix quantum mechanics. We identify string
theory excitations which are related to the Kaluza--Klein excitation of the
Yang--Mills theory on $S^3$.
