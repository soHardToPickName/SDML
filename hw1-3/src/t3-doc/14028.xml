<title>
Deformation Quantization and Nambu Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from deformation quantization (star-products), the quantization
problem of Nambu Mechanics is investigated. After considering some
impossibilities and pushing some analogies with field quantization, a solution
to the quantization problem is presented in the novel approach of Zariski
quantization of fields (observables, functions, in this case polynomials). This
quantization is based on the factorization over ${\Bbb R}$ of polynomials in
several real variables. We quantize the infinite-dimensional algebra of fields
generated by the polynomials by defining a deformation of this algebra which is
Abelian, associative and distributive. This procedure is then adapted to
derivatives (needed for the Nambu brackets), which ensures the validity of the
Fundamental Identity of Nambu Mechanics also at the quantum level. Our
construction is in fact more general than the particular case considered here:
it can be utilized for quite general defining identities and for much more
general star-products.
