An Alternative Perturbative Expansion in Quantum Mechanics. Scaling and
  cut-off Resummation
</title>

<abstract>
  An alternative perturbative expansion in quantum mechanics which allows a
full expression of the scaling arbitrariness is introduced. This expansion is
examined in the case of the anharmonic oscillator and is conveniently resummed
using a method which consists in introducing an energy cut-off that is
carefully removed as the order of the expansion is increased. We illustrate
this technique numerically by computing the asymptotic behavior of the ground
state energy of the anharmonic oscillator for large couplings, and show how the
exploitation of the scaling arbitrariness substantially improves the
convergence of this perturbative expansion.
