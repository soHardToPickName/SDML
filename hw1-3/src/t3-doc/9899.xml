<title>
The Decay of The Five Brane in $AdS_5\times RP^5$
</title>

<abstract>
  The baryon vertex of IIB superstring theory on $AdS_{5}\times
\mathbb{R}P^{5}$, for the case of orthogonal groups, is studied. The energy of
the three brane decayed from an original five brane is calculated explicitly.
The radius of this decayed three brane, for a BPS configuration, is also given
and interpreted.
