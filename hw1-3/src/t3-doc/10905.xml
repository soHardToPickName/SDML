<title>
On redefinitions of variables in gauge field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, for massive fields of spins 2 and 3 with non-canonical
Lagrangians, we build Hamiltonians and full systems of constraints and show
that the use of derivatives in a redefinition of fields can give rise to a
change of number of physical degrees of freedom.
