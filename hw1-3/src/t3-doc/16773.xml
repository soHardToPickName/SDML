Crosscap States for Orientifolds of Euclidean AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  Crosscap states for orientifolds of Euclidean AdS_3 are constructed. We show
that our crosscap states describe the same orientifolds which were obtained by
the classical analysis. The spectral density of open strings in the system with
orientifold can be read from the M"obius strip amplitudes and it is compared to
that of the open strings stretched between branes and their mirrors. We also
compute the Klein bottle amplitudes.
