<title>
Principal Realization for the extended affine Lie algebra of type $sl_2$
  with coordinates in a simple quantum torus with two generators
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an irreducible representation for the extended affine algebra of
type $sl_2$ with coordinates in a quantum torus. We explicitly give formulas
using vertex operators similar to those found in the theory of the infinite
rank affine algebra $A_{\infty}$.
