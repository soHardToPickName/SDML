p-p' System with B-field, Branes at Angles and Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the generic $p-p^\prime$ system in the presence of constant NS
2-form $B_{ij}$ field. We derive properties concerning with the
noncommutativity of D-brane worldvolume, the Green functions and the spectrum
of this system. In the zero slope limit, a large number of light states appear
as the lowest excitations in appropriate cases. We are able to relate the
energies of the lowest states after the GSO projection with the configurations
of branes at angles. Through analytic continuation, the system is compared with
the branes with relative motion.
