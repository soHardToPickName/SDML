<title>
Logarithmic conformal field theories with continuous weights
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the logarithmic conformal field theories in which conformal weights
are continuous subset of real numbers. A general relation between the
correlators consisting of logarithmic fields and those consisting of ordinary
conformal fields is investigated. As an example the correlators of the
Coulomb-gas model are explicitly studied.
