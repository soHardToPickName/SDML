Equivalent effective Lagrangians for Scherk-Schwarz compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the general form of the mass terms that can appear in the
effective field theories of coordinate-dependent compactifications a la
Scherk-Schwarz. As an illustrative example, we consider an interacting
five-dimensional theory compactified on the orbifold S^1/Z_2, with a fermion
subject to twisted periodicity conditions. We show how the same physics can be
described by equivalent effective Lagrangians for periodic fields, related by
field redefinitions and differing only in the form of the five-dimensional mass
terms. In a suitable limit, these mass terms can be localized at the orbifold
fixed points. We also show how to reconstruct the twist parameter from any
given mass terms of the allowed form. Finally, after mentioning some possible
generalizations of our results, we re-discuss the example of brane-induced
supersymmetry breaking in five-dimensional Poincare' supergravity, and comment
on its relation with gaugino condensation in M-theory.
