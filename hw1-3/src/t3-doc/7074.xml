BRST-co-BRST Quantization of Reparametrization Invariant Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study some reparametrization invariant theories in context of the
BRST-co-BRST quantization method. The method imposes restrictions on the
possible gauge fixing conditions and leads to well defined inner product states
through a gauge regularisation procedure. Two explicit examples are also
treated in detail.
