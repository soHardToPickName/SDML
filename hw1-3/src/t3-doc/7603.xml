<title>
5 Dimensional Spacetime with q-deformed Extra Space
</title>

<abstract>
  An attempt to get a non-trivial-mass structure of particles in a
Randall-Sundrum type of 5-dimensional spacetime with q-deformed extra dimension
is discussed. In this spacetime, the fifth dimensional space is boundary free,
but there areises an elastic potential preventing free motion toward the fifth
direction. The q-deformation is, then, introduced in such a way that the
spacetime coordinates become non-commutative between 4-dimensional components
and the fifth component. As a result of this q-deformation, there arises
naturally an ultraviolet-cutoff effect for the propagators of particles
embedded in this spacetime.
