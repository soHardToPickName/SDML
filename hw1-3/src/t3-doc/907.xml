<title>
The Two-Loop Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in Dimensional Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify a discrepancy between two previous calculations of the two-loop
QED Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, both performed in proper-time regularization,
by calculating this quantity in dimensional regularization.
