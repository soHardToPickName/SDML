<title>
Modified triplectic quantization in general coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an extension of previous results (hep-th/0105215)on the
quantization of general gauge theories within the BRST-antBRST invatiant
Lagrangian scheme in general coordinates, namely, we consider the case when the
base manifold of fields and antifields is a supermanifold desribed in terms of
both bosonic and fermionic variables.
