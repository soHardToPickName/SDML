<title>
Mass relations in noncommutative geometry revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the notion of the 'noncommutative coupling constant' given by
Kastler and Sch"ucker by dropping the constraint that it commute with the
Dirac-operator. This leads essentially to the vanishing of the lower bound for
the Higgsmass and of the upper bound for the W-mass.
