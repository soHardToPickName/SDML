Renormalization in spherical field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive several results concerning non-perturbative renormalization in the
spherical field formalism. Using a small set of local counterterms, we are able
to remove all ultraviolet divergences in a manner such that the renormalized
theory is finite and translationally invariant. As an explicit example we
consider massless phi^4 theory in four dimensions.
