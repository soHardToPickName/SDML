The Rotating Quantum Thermal Distribution
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the rigidly rotating quantum thermal distribution on flat
space-time suffers from a global pathology which can be cured by introducing a
cylindrical mirror if and only if it has a radius smaller than that of the
speed-of-light cylinder. When this condition is met, we demonstrate numerically
that the renormalized expectation value of the energy-momentum stress tensor
corresponds to a rigidly rotating thermal bath up to a finite correction except
on the mirror where there are the usual Casimir divergences.
