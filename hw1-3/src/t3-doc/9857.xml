BPS States and Vacuum Manifold of SU_q(n) Georgi-Glashow Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Georgi-Glashow Lagrangian for gauge group SU_q(n). Breaking
this symmetry spontaneously gives q-dependent masses of gauge field and vacuum
manifold. It turned out that the vacuum manifold is parameterized by the
non-commutative quantities. We showed that the monopole solutions exist in this
model, which is indicated by the presence of the BPS states.
