<title>
New Regular Black Hole Solution from Nonlinear Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to General Relativity a new regular
exact black hole solution is found. The nonlinear theory reduces to the Maxwell
one in the weak limit, and the solution corresponds to a charged black hole for
|q| \leq 2s_c m \approx 1.05 m, with metric, curvature invariants, and electric
field regular everywhere.
