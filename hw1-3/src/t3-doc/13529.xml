Skyrmions scattering in (2+1)-dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The scattering properties of the non-linear $O(3)$ model in (2+1)-D, modified
by the addition of both a potential-like term and a Skyrme-like term, are
considered. Most of the work is numerical. The skyrmion-scattering is found to
be quasi-elastic, the skyrmions' energy density profiles remaining unscathed
after collisions. In low-energy processes the skyrmions exhibit
back-scattering, while at larger energies they scatter at right angles. These
results confirm those obtained in previous investigations, in which a similar
problem was studied for a different choice of the potential-like term.
