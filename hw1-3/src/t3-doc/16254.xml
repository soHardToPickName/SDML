<title>
A theory of algebraic integration
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we extend the idea of integration to generic algebras. In
particular we concentrate over a class of algebras, that we will call
self-conjugated, having the property of possessing equivalent right and left
multiplication algebras. In this case it is always possible to define an
integral sharing many of the properties of the usual integral. For instance, if
the algebra has a continuous group of automorphisms, the corresponding
derivations are such that the usual formula of integration by parts holds. We
discuss also how to integrate over subalgebras. Many examples are discussed,
starting with Grassmann algebras, where we recover the usual Berezin's rule.
The paraGrassmann algebras are also considered, as well as the algebra of
matrices. Since Grassmann and paraGrassmann algebras can be represented by
matrices we show also that their integrals can be seen in terms of traces over
the corresponding matrices. An interesting application is to the case of group
algebras where we show that our definition of integral is equivalent to a sum
over the unitary irreducuble representations of the group. We show also some
example of integration over non self-conjugated algebras (the bosonic and the
$q$-bosonic oscillators), and over non-associative algebras (the octonions).
