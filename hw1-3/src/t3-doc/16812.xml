String-Like Description of Gravity and Possible Applications for
  F-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Lorentz harmonic formulation of D-dimensional bosonic p-brane theory with
$D\geq (p+1)(p+2)/2$ coupled to an antisymmetric tensor field of rank d=(p+1)
provides the dynamical ground for the description of d=(p+1) dimensional
Gravity. It hence realizes the idea of Regge and Teitelboim on a 'string-like'
description of gravity. The simplest nontrivial models of such a kind are
provided by free D-dimensional p-branes in which world volumes are embedded as
minimal surfaces. Possible applications of such a model with d=2+2 and D=2+10
for studying a geometry of bosonic sector of F-theory are considered. Some
speculations inspired by the proposed model are presented.
