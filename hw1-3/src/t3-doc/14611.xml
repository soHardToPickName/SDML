Weak Measurements
</title>

<abstract>
  Weak measurement is a standard measuring procedure with two changes: it is
performed on pre- and post-selected quantum systems and the coupling to the
measuring device is weakened. The outcomes of weak measurements, ``weak
values'' are very different for the eigenvalues of the measured operators. The
weak values yield novel rich structure of the quantum world. Weak values help
explaining peculiar quantum phenomena and finding new effects which might have
practical applications.
