<title>
High-precision estimates of critical quantities by means of improved
  Hamiltonians
</title>

<abstract>
  Three-dimensional spin models of the Ising and XY universality classes are
studied by a combination of high-temperature expansions and Monte Carlo
simulations applied to improved Hamiltonians. The critical exponents and the
critical equation of state are determined to very high precision.
