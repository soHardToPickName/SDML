<title>
BV analysis for covariant and non-covariant actions
</title>

<abstract>
  The equivalence between the covariant and the non-covariant version of a
constrained system is shown to hold after quantization in the framework of the
field-antifield formalism. Our study covers the cases of Electromagnetism and
Yang-Mills fields and sheds light on some aspects of the Faddeev-Popov method,
for both the coratiant and non-covariant approaches, which had not been fully
clarified in the literature.
