An Exact Solution to O(26) Sigma Model coupled to 2-D Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  By a mapping to the bosonic string theory, we present an exact solution to
the O(26) sigma model coupled to 2-D quantum gravity. In particular, we obtain
the exact gravitational dressing to the various matter operators classified by
the irreducible representations of O(26). We also derive the exact form of the
gravitationally modified beta function for the original coupling constant
$e^2$. The relation between our exact solution and the asymptotic solution
given in ref[3] is discussed in various aspects.
