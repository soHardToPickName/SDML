Aspects of Large N Gauge Theory Dynamics as Seen by String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we explore some of the features of large N supersymmetric and
nonsupersymmetric gauge theories using Maldacena's duality conjectures. We
shall show that the resulting strong coupling behavior of the gauge theories is
consistent with our qualitative expectations of these theories. Some of these
consistency checks are highly nontrivial and give additional evidence for the
validity of the proposed dualities.
