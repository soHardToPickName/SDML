<title>
On Berenstein-Douglas-Seiberg Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the proposal of Berenstein-Douglas for a completely general
definition of Seiberg duality. To give evidence for their conjecture I present
the first example of a physical dual pair and explicitly check that it
satisfies the requirements. Then I explicitly show that a pair of toric dual
quivers is also dual according to their proposal. All these computations go
beyond tilting modules, and really work in the derived category. I introduce
all necessary mathematics where needed.
