<title>
Quark Condensates in Non-Supersymmetric MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A set of non-supersymmetric minimal area embeddings of an M-theory 5-brane
are considered. The field theories on the surface of the 5-brane have the field
content of N=2 SQCD with fundamental representation matter fields. By suitable
choice of curve parameters the N=2 and N=1 superpartners may be decoupled
leaving a semi-classical approximation to QCD with massive quarks. As
supersymmetry breaking is introduced a quark condensate grows breaking the low
energy $Z_{F}$ flavour symmetry. At $\theta =$ (odd) $\pi$ spontaneous CP
violation is observed consistent with that of the QCD chiral lagrangian.
