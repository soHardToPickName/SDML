<title>
Path Integration Via Summation of Perturbation Expansions and
  Applications to Totally Reflecting Boundaries, and Potential Steps
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral for the propagator is expanded into a perturbation series,
which can be exactly summed in the case of $\delta$-function perturbations
giving a closed expression for the (energy-dependent) Green function. Making
the strength of the $\delta$-function perturbation infinite repulsive, produces
a totally reflecting boundary, hence giving a path integral solution in
half-spaces in terms of the corresponding Green function. The example of the
Wood-Saxon potential serves by an appropriate limiting procedure to obtain the
Green function for the step-potential and the finite potential-well in the
half-space, respectively.
