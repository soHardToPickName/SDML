Tensor Multiplets in Six-Dimensional (2,0) Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the complete coupling of $(2,0)$ supergravity in six dimensions
to $n$ tensor multiplets, extending previous results to all orders in the fermi
fields. The truncation to $(1,0)$ supergravity coupled to tensor multiplets
exactly reproduces the complete couplings recently obtained.
