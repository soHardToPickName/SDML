<title>
Gauge Boson and Fermion Masses Without a Higgs Field
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple, anomaly-free chiral gauge theory can be perturbatively quantised
and renormalised in such a way as to generate fermion and gauge boson masses.
This development exploits certain freedoms inherent in choosing the unperturbed
Lagrangian and in the renormalisation procedure. Apart from its intrinsic
interest, such a mechanism might be employed in electroweak gauge theory to
generate fermion and gauge boson masses without a Higgs sector.
