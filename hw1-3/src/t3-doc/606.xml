<title>
Oscillator as a hidden non-Abelian monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  A non--Abelian $SU(2)$ model is constructed for a five--dimensional bound
system "charge--dyon" on the basis of the Hurwitz--transformed
eight--dimensional isotropic quantum oscillator. The principle of
dyon--oscillator duality is formulated; the energy spectrum and wave functions
of the system "charge--dyon" are calculated.
