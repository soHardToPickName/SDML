Deformations of Differential Calculi
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been suggested that quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field
could give rise in the lowest approximation to an effective noncommutative
version of Kaluza-Klein theory which has as extra hidden structure a
noncommutative geometry. It would seem however from the Standard Model, at
least as far as the weak interactions are concerned, that a double-sheeted
structure is the phenomenologically appropriate one at present accelerator
energies. We examine here to what extent this latter structure can be
considered as a singular limit of the former.
