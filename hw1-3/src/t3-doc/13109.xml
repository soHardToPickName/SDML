Cascade of Special Holonomy Manifolds and Heterotic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate hetrotic string theory on special holonomy manifolds including
exceptional holonomy G_2 and Spin(7) manifolds. The gauge symmetry is F_4 in a
G_2 manifold compactification, and so(9) in a Spin(7) manifold
compactification. We also study the cascade of the holonomies: so(8) > Spin(7)
> G_2 > su(3) > su(2). The differences of adjoining groups are described by
Ising, tricritical Ising, 3-state Potts and u(1) models. These theories are
essential for spacetime supersymmetries and gauge group enhancements. As
concrete examples, we construct modular invariant partition functions and
analyze their massless spectra for G_2 and Spin(7) orbifolds. We obtain the
relation between topological numbers of the manifolds and multiplicities of
matters in specific representations.
