<title>
Gauge Invariant Formulations of Lineal Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the currently studied ``string-inspired'' model for gravity
on a line can be formulated as a gauge invariant theory based on the Poincar\'e
group with central extension -- a formulation that complements and simplifies
H.~Verlinde's construction based on the unextended Poincar\'e group.
