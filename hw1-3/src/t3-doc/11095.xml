Target Space Duality II: Applications
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the framework developed in Target Space Duality I: General Theory.
We show that both nonabelian duality and Poisson-Lie duality are examples of
the general theory. We propose how the formalism leads to a systematic study of
duality by studying few scenarios that lead to open questions in the theory of
Lie algebras. We present evidence that there are probably new examples of
irreducible target space duality.
