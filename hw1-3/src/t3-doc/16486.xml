Implications of bulk causality for holography in AdS
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational time delay in asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces has
consequences for holographic duality. We argue that the requirement of bulk
causality implies that it is not possible for a collection of boundary
observers, performing local measurements, to extract information from
precursors. Using similar arguments, we derive an integrated weak energy
constraint on spacetimes which can admit a holographic dual.
