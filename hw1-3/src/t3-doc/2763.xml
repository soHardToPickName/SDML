<title>
Supersymmetrization of generalized Freedman-Townsend models
</title>

<abstract>
  We review briefly generalized Freedman-Townsend models found recently by
Henneaux and Knaepen, and provide supersymmetric versions of such models in
four dimensions which couple 2-form gauge potentials and ordinary gauge fields
in a gauge invariant and supersymmetric manner. The latter models have the
unusual feature that, in a WZ gauge, the supersymmetry transformations do not
commute with all the gauge transformations.
