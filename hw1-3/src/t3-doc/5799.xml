An All-Orders Derivative Expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the exact $QED_{2+1}$ effective action for fermions in the
presence of a family of static but spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field
profiles. This exact result yields an all-orders derivative expansion of the
effective action, and indicates that the derivative expansion is an asymptotic,
rather than a convergent, expansion.
