Generalized Fock Spaces and New Forms of Quantum Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  The recent discoveries of new forms of quantum statistics require a close
look at the under-lying Fock space structure. This exercise becomes all the
more important in order to provide a general classification scheme for various
forms of statistics, and establish interconnections among them whenever it is
possible. We formulate a theory of generalized Fock spaces, which has a three
tired structure consisting of Fock space, statistics and algebra. This general
formalism unifies various forms of statistics and algebras, which were earlier
considered to describe different systems. Besides, the formalism allows us to
construct many new kinds of quantum statistics and the associated algebras of
creation and destruction operators. Some of these are: orthostatistics, null
statistics or statistics of frozen order, quantum group based statistics and
its many avatars, and `doubly-infinite' statistics. The emergence of new forms
of quantum statistics for particles interacting with singular potential is also
highlighted.
