Anti de Sitter Gravity from BF-Chern-Simons-Higgs Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that an action inspired from a BF and Chern-Simons model, based
on the $AdS_4$ isometry group SO(3, 2), with the inclusion of a Higgs potential
term, furnishes the MacDowell-Mansouri-Chamseddine-West action for gravity,
with a Gauss-Bonnet and cosmological constant term. The $AdS_4$ space is a
natural vacuum of the theory. Using Vasiliev's procedure to construct higher
spin massless fields in AdS spaces and a suitable star product, we discuss the
preliminary steps to construct the corresponding higher-spin action in $AdS_4$
space representing the higher spin extension of this model. Brief remarks on
Noncommutative Gravity are made.
