Self-duality and soldering in odd dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the recently developed soldering formalism we highlight certain
features of quantum mechanical models. The complete correspondence between
these models and self dual field theoretical models in odd dimensions is
established. The distinction between self duality and self dual factorisation
in these dimensions is clarified.
