Binding Energy in Two and Three-Body Relativistic Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-body and three-body systems of scalar bosons are considered in the
framework of covariant constraint dynamics. The reduced equation obtained after
eliminating redundant degrees of freedom can be viewed as an eigenvalue
equation for an observable which is intimately related with the relative
motion. We display the connection of this observable with binding energy.
