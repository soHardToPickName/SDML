<title>
U(N) Matrix Difference Equations and a Nested Bethe Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  A system of U(N)-matrix difference equations is solved by means of a nested
version of a generalized Bethe Ansatz. The highest weight property of the
solutions is proved and some examples of solutions are calculated explicitly.
(Part II of a series of articles on the generalized nested Bethe Ansatz and
difference equations.)
