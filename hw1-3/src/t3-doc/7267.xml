<title>
The Gravitational Field of String Matter When the Dilaton is Massive
</title>

<abstract>
  We study numerically the gravitational field of a star made of massive and
neutral string states for the case in which the dilaton is massive. The
solution exhibits very simple scaling properties in the dilaton mass. There is
no horizon and the singularity is surrounded by a halo (the physical size of
which is inversely proportional to the dilaton mass) where the scalar curvature
is very large and proportional to the square of the dilaton mass.
