Lotka--Volterra Type Equations and their Explicit Integration
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present note we give an explicit integration of some
two--dimensionalised Lotka--Volterra type equations associated with simple Lie
algebras, other than the familiar $A_n$ case, possessing a representation
without branching. This allows us, in particular, to treat the first
fundamental representations of $A_r$, $B_r$, $C_r$, and $G_2$ on the same
footing.
