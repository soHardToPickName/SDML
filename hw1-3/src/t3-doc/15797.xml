Moving Mixed Branes in Compact Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we present a general description of two moving branes in
presence of the $B_{\mu \nu}$ field and gauge fields $A^{(1)}_{\alpha_1}$ and
$A^{(2)}_{\alpha_2}$ on them, in spacetime in which some of its directions are
compact on tori. Some examples are considered to elucidate this general
description. Also contribution of the massless states to the interaction is
extracted. Boundary state formalism is a useful tool for these considerations.
