Gauging the SU(2) Skyrme model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the SU(2) Skyrme model will be reformulated as a gauge theory
and the hidden symmetry will be investigated and explored in the energy
spectrum computation. To this end we purpose a new constraint conversion
scheme, based on the symplectic framework with the introduction of Wess-Zumino
(WZ) terms in an unambiguous way. It is a positive feature not present on the
BFFT constraint conversion. The Dirac's procedure for the first-class
constraints is employed to quantize this gauge invariant nonlinear system and
the energy spectrum is computed. The finding out shows the power of the
symplectic gauge-invariant formalism when compared with another constraint
conversion procedures present on the literature.
