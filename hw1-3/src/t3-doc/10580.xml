String Theory Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  The past year has seen enormous progress in string theory. It has become
clear that all of the different string theories are different limits of a
single theory. Moreover, in certain limits, one obtains a new,
eleven-dimensional structure known as $M$-theory. Strings with unusual boundary
conditions, known as D-branes, turn out to be soliton solutions of string
theory. These have provided a powerful tool to probe the structure of these
theories. Most dramatically, they have yielded a partial understanding of the
thermodynamics of black holes in a consistent quantum mechanical framework. In
this brief talk, I attempt to give some flavor of these developments.
