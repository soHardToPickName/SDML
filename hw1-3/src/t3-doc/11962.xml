Canonical transformations and soldering
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the recently developed soldering formalism in the Lagrangian
approach and canonical transformations in the Hamiltonian approach are
complementary. The examples of gauged chiral bosons in two dimensions and
self-dual models in three dimensions are discussed in details.
