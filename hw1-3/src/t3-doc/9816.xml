<title>
Extended form method of antifield-BRST formalism for BF theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The Batalin-Vilkovisky antifield action for the BF theories is constructed by
means of the extended form method. The BRST invariant BV antifield action is
directly written down by making use of the extended forms that involve all the
required ghosts and antifields.
