<title>
Duality and Dynamical Supersymmetry Breaking in $Spin(10)$ with a Spinor
</title>

<abstract>
  We study ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $Spin(10)$ chiral gauge theories with a
single spinor representation and $N$ vector representations. We present a dual
description in terms of an ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric $SU(N-5)$ chiral gauge
theory with a symmetric tensor, one fundamental and $N$ antifundamental
representations. The $Spin(10)$ theory with $N=0$ breaks supersymmetry at
strong coupling; we study how this arises at weak coupling in the dual theory,
which is a spontaneously broken gauge theory. Also, we recover various known
dualities, find new dual pairs and generate new examples of dynamical
supersymmetry breaking.
