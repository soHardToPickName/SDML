M(atrix) Black Holes in Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine five dimensional extreme black holes with three charges in the
matrix model. We build configurations of the 5+1 super Yang-Mills theory which
correspond to black holes with transverse momentum charge. We calculate their
mass and entropy from the super Yang-Mills theory and find that they match the
semi-classical black hole results. We extend our results to nonextreme black
holes in the dilute gas approximation.
