Excited States of Calogero-Sutherland Model and Singular Vectors of the
  $W_N$ Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the collective field method, we find a relation between the Jack
symmetric polynomials, which describe the excited states of the
Calogero-Sutherland model, and the singular vectors of the $W_N$ algebra. Based
on this relation, we obtain their integral representations. We also give a
direct algebraic method which leads to the same result, and integral
representations of the skew-Jack polynomials.
