<title>
Quantum Algebras for Maximal Motion Groups of N-Dimensional Flat Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  An embedding method to get $q$-deformations for the non--semisimple algebras
generating the motion groups of $N$--dimensional flat spaces is presented. This
method gives a global and simultaneous scheme of $q$-deformation for all
$iso(p,q)$ algebras and for those ones obtained from them by some
In\"on\"u--Wigner contractions, such as the $N$--dimensional Euclidean,
Poincar\'e and Galilei algebras.
