<title>
The Discrete Symmetry of the N=2 Supersymmetric Modified NLS Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  A few new N=2 superintegrable mappings in the (1|2) superspace are proposed
and their origin is analyzed. Using one of them, acting like the discrete
symmetry transformation of the N=2 supersymmetric modified NLS hierarchy, the
recursion operator and hamiltonian structures of the hierarchy are constructed.
