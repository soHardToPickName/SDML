<title>
Open Membranes in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss how to construct open membranes in the recently proposed matrix
model of M theory. In order to sustain an open membrane, two boundary terms are
needed in the construction. These boundary terms are available in the system of
the longitudinal five-branes and D0-branes.
