Contraction and decomposition matrices for vacuum diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  Tensor reduction of vacuum diagrams uses contraction and decomposition
matrices. We present general recurrence relations for the calculation of those
matrices and an explicit formula for the 3-loop decomposition matrix and its
determinant.
