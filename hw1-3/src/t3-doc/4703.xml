<title>
Test of Gauge Covariance of Fermion-Photon Vertex in Quenched, Massless
  Three Dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the gauge covariance of the fermion-photon vertex in quenched,
massless 3-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. A class of vertex Ans\"{a}tze
obtained by generalizing that proposed by Dong et al. is tested using the
invariance of the photon polarization scalar under the Landau-Khalatnikov
transformation.
