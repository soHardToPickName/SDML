<title>
A Stochastic Model of a Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
The problem of obtaining a realistic, relativistic description of a quantum
system is discussed in the context of a simple (light-cone) lattice field
theory. A natural stochastic model is proposed which, although non-local, is
relativistic (in the appropriate lattice sense), and which is operationally
indistinguishable from the standard quantum theory. The generalization to a
broad class of lattice theories is briefly described.
