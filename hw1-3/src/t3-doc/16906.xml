Dynamics of Brane-World Cosmological Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that generically the initial singularity is isotropic in spatially
homogeneous cosmological models in the brane-world scenario. We then argue that
it is plausible that the initial singularity is isotropic in typical brane
world cosmological models. Therefore, brane cosmology naturally gives rise to a
set of initial data that provide the conditions for inflation to subsequently
take place, thereby solving the initial conditions problem and leading to a
self--consistent and viable cosmology.
