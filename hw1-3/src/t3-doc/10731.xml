Bloch-Nordsieck Approximation in Linearized Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of this article is to review Fradkin's contribution in the realm of
eikonal physics. In particular, the so-called Fradkin representation is
employed to investigate a certain subclass of Feynman diagrams resulting in an
expression for the scattering amplitude at Planckian energies. The 't Hooft
poles are reproduced.
