Casimir Energy and Vacua vor Superconducting Ball in Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Casimir energy for solid conducting ball is considered on the base of some
finite models. One model is physical and built of a battery of parallel
metallic plates. Two finite models are based on the Higgs model of
superconductivity. One of them is supersymmetric and based on the Witten field
model for superconducting strings. Treatment shows that contribution of Casimir
energy can be very essential for superdence state in the neutron stars and
nuclear matter.
