Superconformal Transformation Properties of the Supercurrent II: Abelian
  Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the superconformal transformation properties of the supercurrent
for N=1 supersymmetric QED in four dimensions within the superfield formalism.
Superconformal Ward identities for Green functions involving insertions of the
supercurrent are conveniently derived by coupling the supercurrent to the
appropriate prepotential of a classical curved superspace background, and by
combining superdiffeomorphisms and super Weyl transformations. We determine all
superconformal anomalies of SQED on curved superspace within an all-order
perturbative approach and derive a local Callan-Symanzik equation. Particular
importance is given to the issue of gauge invariance.
