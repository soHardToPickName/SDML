Anyons in Electromagnetic Field and the BMT Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The Lagrangian model for anyon, presented in [6], is extended to include
interactions with external, homogeneous electromagnetic field. Explicit
electric and magnetic moment terms for the anyon are introduced in the
Lagrangian. The 2+1-dimensional BMT equation as well as the correct value (2)
of the gyromagnetic ratio is rederived, in the Hamiltonian framework.
