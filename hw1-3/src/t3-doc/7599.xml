<title>
Violation of the string hypothesis and Heisenberg XXZ spin chain
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we count the numbers of real and complex solutions to Bethe
constraints in the two particle sector of the XXZ model. We find exact number
of exceptions to the string conjecture and total number of solutions which is
required for completeness.
