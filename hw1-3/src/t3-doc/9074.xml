<title>
Integrals of periodic motion for classical equations of relativistic
  string with masses at ends
</title>

<abstract>
  Boundary equations for the relativistic string with masses at ends are
formulated in terms of geometrical invariants of world trajectories of masses
at the string ends. In the three-dimensional Minkowski space $E^1_2$, there are
two invariants of that sort, the curvature $K$ and torsion $\kappa$. For these
equations of motion with periodic $\kappa_i(\tau+n l)=\kappa(\tau)$, constants
of motion are obtained.
