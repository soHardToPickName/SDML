<title>
Pauli equation and the method of supersymmetric factorization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider different variants of factorization of a 2x2 matrix
Schroedinger/Pauli operator in two spatial dimensions. They allow to relate its
spectrum to the sum of spectra of two scalar Schroedinger operators, in a
manner similar to one-dimensional Darboux transformations. We consider both the
case when such factorization is reduced to the ordinary 2-dimensional SUSY QM
quasifactorization and a more general case which involves covariant
derivatives. The admissible classes of electromagnetic fields are described and
some illustrative examples are given.
