<title>
Propagation of particles and strings in one-dimensional Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the basics of the dynamics of closed strings moving along the
discretized line \Z. The string excitations are described by a field
\phi_x(\tau) where x is the position of the string in the embedding space and
\tau is a semi-infinite ``euclidean time'' parameter related to the
longitudinal mode of the string. Interactions due to splitting and joining of
closed strings are taken into account by a local potential and occur only along
the edge \tau =0 of the semi-plane (x, \tau).
