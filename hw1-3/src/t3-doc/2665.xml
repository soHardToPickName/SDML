<title>
Edge States and Entanglement Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  It is known that gauge fields defined on manifolds with spatial boundaries
support states localized at the boundaries. In this paper, we demonstrate how
coarse-graining over these states can lead to an entanglement entropy. In
particular, we show that the entanglement entropy of the ground state for the
quantum Hall effect on a disk exhibits an approximate ``area " law.
