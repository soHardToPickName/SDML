Strong Coupling Phenomena on the Noncommutative Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study strong coupling phenomena in U(1) gauge theory on the
non-commutative plane. To do so, we make use of a T-dual description in terms
of an $N\to\infty$ limit of U(N) gauge theory on a commutative torus. The
magnetic flux on this torus is taken to be $m=N-1$, while the area scales like
1/N, keeping $\Lambda_{QCD}$ fixed. With a few assumptions, we argue that the
speed of high frequency light in pure non-commutative QED is modified in the
non-commutative directions by the factor $1 + \Lambda_{QCD}^4 \theta^2$, where
$\theta$ is the non-commutative parameter. If charged flavours are included,
there is an upper bound on the momentum of a photon propagating in the
non-commutative directions, beyond which it is unstable against production of
charged pairs. We also discuss a particular $\theta\to\infty$ limit of pure
non-commutative QED which is T-dual to a more conventional $N\to\infty$ limit
with $m/N$ fixed. In the non-commutative description, this limit gives rise to
an exotic theory of open strings.
