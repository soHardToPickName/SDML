Scaling laws in hadronic processes and string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a possible scheme for getting the known QCD scaling laws within
string theory. In particular, we consider amplitudes for exclusive scattering
of hadrons at large momentum transfer, hadronic form factors and distribution
functions.
