<title>
A configuration of 11-dimensional curved superspace as backgrounds for
  supermembrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate all of vielbein superfields up to second order in anticommuting
coordinates in terms of the component fields of 11-dimensional on-shell
supergravity by using `Gauge completion'. This configuration of superspace
holds the $\kappa $-symmetry for supermembrane Lagrangian and represents
11-dimensional on-shell supergravity.
