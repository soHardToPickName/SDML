<title>
Simplifications of four-point functions in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
  theory at two loops
</title>

<abstract>
  The superconformal Ward identities combined with N=2 harmonic analyticity are
used to evaluate two-loop four-point correlation functions of gauge-invariant
operators in D=4, N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in terms of the
well-known one-loop box integral. The result is confirmed by a direct numerical
computation.
