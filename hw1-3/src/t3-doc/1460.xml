Free Field Realizations of Affine Current Superalgebras, Screening
  Currents and Primary Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper free field realizations of affine current superalgebras are
considered. Based on quantizing differential operator realizations of the
corresponding basic Lie superalgebras, general and simple expressions for both
the bosonic and the fermionic currents are provided. Screening currents of the
first kind are also presented. Finally, explicit free field realizations of
primary fields with general, possibly non-integer, weights are worked out. A
formalism is used where the (generally infinite) multiplet is replaced by a
generating function primary operator. The results allow setting up integral
representations for correlators of primary fields corresponding to integrable
representations. The results are generalizations to superalgebras of a recent
work on free field realizations of affine current algebras by Petersen, Yu and
the present author.
