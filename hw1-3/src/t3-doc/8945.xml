Computation of $\beta(g_c)$ at O(1/N^2) in the O(N) Gross Neveu Model in
  Arbitrary Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the corrections to the asymptotic scaling forms of the fields of the
$O(N)$ Gross Neveu model to solve the dressed skeleton Schwinger Dyson
equations, we deduce the critical exponent corresponding to the
$\beta$-function of the model at $O(1/N^2)$.
