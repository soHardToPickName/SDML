<title>
The Weinberg - Faddeev solution to the problems of quantum field theory
  and quantum gravity:quantum spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper a fundamental length is introduced into physics. This is done
in a way which respects special relativity and quantum field theory. The theory
has formal similarity to quantum field theory though its properties are far
better: divergences are got rid of. The problem of quantizing gravity is
straightforward in the approach.
