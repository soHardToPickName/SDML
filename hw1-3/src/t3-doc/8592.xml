<title>
A Closed, Expanding Universe in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a conformal field theory -- obtained from a gauged WZW model --
that describes a closed, inhomogeneous expanding and recollapsing universe in
$3+1$ dimensions. A possible violation of cosmic censorship is avoided because
the universe recollapses just when a naked singularity was about to form. The
model has been chosen to have $c=4$ (or $\widehat c=4$ in the supersymmetric
case), just like four dimensional Minkowski space.
