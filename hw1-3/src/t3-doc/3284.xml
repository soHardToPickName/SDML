<title>
Descent Relation of Tachyon Condensation from Boundary String Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze how lower-dimensional bosonic D-branes further decay, using the
boundary string field theory. Especially we find that the effective tachyon
potential of the lower-dimensional D-brane has the same profile as that of
D25-brane.
