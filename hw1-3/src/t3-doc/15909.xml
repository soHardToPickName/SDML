<title>
Geometric Realizations of BPS States in N=2 Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the BPS spectrum of the theory on a D3-brane probe in F theory. The
BPS states are realized by multi-string configurations in spacetime. Only
certain configurations obeying a selection rule give rise to BPS states in the
four-dimensional probe theory. Using these string configurations, we determine
the spectrum of N=2 SU(2) Yang-Mills. We also explore the relation between
multi-string configurations, M theory membranes and self-dual strings.
