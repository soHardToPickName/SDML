<title>
Supersymmetric dyonic black holes of IIA string on Six Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of four-dimensional static supersymmetric black hole solutions of
effective supergravity Lagrangian of IIA superstring compactified on $T^6$ is
constructed by explicitly solving Killing spinor equations (KSEs). These
solutions are dyonic black holes parametrized by four charges, with dilaton and
diagonal internal metric components as the only non-zero scalar fields, and
preserve $1 \over 8$ of $N=8$ supersymmetry. The KSEs with only
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz charges relate spinors with opposite chirality from
ten-dimensional view point, and have identical structures with KSEs of
toroidally compactified heterotic string. We also find a solution with four
Ramond-Ramond charges which is U-dual to the solution with four
Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz charges, and corresponds to the intersecting
D-brane configuration with two 2-branes and two 4-branes. A configuration with
both Neveu-Schwarz-Neveu-Schwarz charges and Ramond-Ramond charges is also
found. We show that the configurations T-dual to the above solutions are also
solutions of the KSEs. The patterns of supersymmetry breaking are studied in
detail.
