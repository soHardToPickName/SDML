<title>
Transition Amplitude within the Stochastic Quantization Scheme --
  Perturbative Treatment
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum mechanical transition amplitudes are calculated perturbatively on
the basis of the stochastic quantization method of Parisi and Wu. It is shown
that the stochastic scheme reproduces the ordinary result for the amplitude and
systematically incorporates higher-order effects, even at the lowest order.
