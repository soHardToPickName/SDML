<title>
Instability of Spacelike and Null Orbifold Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  Time dependent orbifolds with spacelike or null singularities have recently
been studied as simple models of cosmological singularities. We show that their
apparent simplicity is an illusion: the introduction of a single particle
causes the spacetime to collapse to a strong curvature singularity (a Big
Crunch), even in regions arbitrarily far from the particle.
