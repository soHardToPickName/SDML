Logarithmic Universality in Random Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Universality in unitary invariant random matrix ensembles with complex matrix
elements is considered. We treat two general ensembles which have a determinant
factor in the weight. These ensembles are relevant, e.g., for spectra of the
Dirac operator in QCD. In addition to the well established universality with
respect to the choice of potential, we prove that microscopic spectral
correlators are unaffected when the matrix in the determinant is replaced by an
expansion in powers of the matrix. We refer to this invariance as logarithmic
universality. The result is used in proving that a simple random matrix model
with Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry has the same microscopic spectral correlators as
chiral random matrix theory.
