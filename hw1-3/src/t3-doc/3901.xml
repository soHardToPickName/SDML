On root systems in spaces with degenerate metric
</title>

<abstract>
  A root systems in Carroll spaces with degenerate metric are defined. It is
shown that their Cartan matrices and reflection groups are affine. With the
help of the geometric consideration the root system structure of affine
algebras is determined by a sufficiently simple algorithm.
