<title>
Heat Kernel Expansion for Semitransparent Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the heat kernel for an operator of Laplace type with a
$\delta$-function potential concentrated on a closed surface. We derive the
general form of the small $t$ asymptotics and calculate explicitly several
first heat kernel coefficients.
