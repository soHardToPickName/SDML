<title>
Regularization of Non-Linear Spinor Field Models by Discrete Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize a regularization method of Stumpf 1984 in the case of
non-linear spinor field models to fourth order theories and to non-scalar
interactions. The involved discrete symmetries can be connected with C,P,T
transformations.
