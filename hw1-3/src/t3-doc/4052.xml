<title>
A comment on ``On Non-Abelian Duality'' by Enrique \'Alvarez, Luis
  \'Alvarez-Gaum\'e and Yolanda Lozano
</title>

<abstract>
  The paper commented upon gives the impression that whether the gauged version
of a sigma model gives rise to the original or the dual model depends on the
choice of gauge fixing. It is demonstrated here that this is not so.
