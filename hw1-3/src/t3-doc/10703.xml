On the constrained KP hierarchy II
</title>

<abstract>
  A constrained KP hierarchy is discussed that was recently suggested by Aratyn
et al. and by Bonora et al. This hierarchy is a restriction of the KP to a
submanifold of operators which can be represented as a ratio of two purely
differential operators of prescribed orders. Explicit formulas for action of
vector fields on these two differential operators are written which gives a new
description of the hierarchy and provides a new, more constructive, proof of
compatibility of the constraint with the hierarchy. Also the Poisson structure
of the constrained hierarchy is discussed.
