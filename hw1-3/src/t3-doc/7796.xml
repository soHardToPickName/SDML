<title>
A Note on the Equivalence of Vafa's and Douglas's Picture of Discrete
  Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  For a general nonabelian group action and an arbitrary genus worldsheet we
show that Vafa's old definition of discrete torsion coincides with Douglas's
D-brane definition of discrete torsion associated to projective
representations.
