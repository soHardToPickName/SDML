Rotating Super Black Hole as Spinning Particle
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a review of the works devoted to the treatment of the Kerr super
black hole solution as a spinning particle. The real, complex and stringy
structures of the Kerr and super-Kerr geometries are discussed, as well as the
recent results on the regular matter source for the Kerr spinning particle. It
is shown that the source has to represent a rotating bag-like bubble having
(A)dS interior and a smooth domain wall boundary. The given by Morris
supersymmetric generalization of the U(I) x U'(I) field model (which was used
by Witten to describe cosmic superconducting strings) is considered, and it is
shown that this model can be adapted for description of superconducting bags
having a long range external electromagnetic field and another gauge field
confined inside the bag.
