<title>
Isospectral flow in Loop Algebras and Quasiperiodic Solutions of the
  Sine-Gordon Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The sine-Gordon equation is considered in the hamiltonian framework provided
by the Adler-Kostant-Symes theorem. The phase space, a finite dimensional
coadjoint orbit in the dual space $\grg^*$ of a loop algebra $\grg$, is
parametrized by a finite dimensional symplectic vector space $W$ embedded into
$\grg^*$ by a moment map. Real quasiperiodic solutions are computed in terms of
theta functions using a Liouville generating function which generates a
canonical transformation to linear coordinates on the Jacobi variety of a
suitable hyperelliptic curve.
