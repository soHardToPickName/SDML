Consistent superconformal boundary states
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a supersymmetric generalization of Cardy's equation for consistent
N=1 superconformal boundary states. We solve this equation for the
superconformal minimal models SM(p/p+2) with p odd, and thereby provide a
classification of the possible superconformal boundary conditions. In addition
to the Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and Ramond (R) boundary states, there are NS~ states.
The NS and NS~ boundary states are related by a Z_2 "spin-reversal"
transformation. We treat the tricritical Ising model as an example, and in an
appendix we discuss the (non-superconformal) case of the Ising model.
