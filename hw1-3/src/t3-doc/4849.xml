<title>
New solution of vertex type tetrahedron equations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we formulate a new N-state spin integrable model on a
three-dimensional lattice with spins interacting round each elementary cube of
the lattice. This model can be also reformulated as a vertex type model. Weight
functions of the model satisfy tetrahedron equations.
