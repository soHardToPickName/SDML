On quasinormal modes of small Schwarzschild-Anti-de-Sitter black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the quasinormal modes associated with decay of the massless scalar
filed around a small Schwarzschild-Anti-de-Sitter black hole. The computations
shows that when the horizon radius is much less than the anti-de-Sitter radius,
the imaginary part of the frequency goes to zero as $r_+^{d-2}$ while the real
part of $\omega$ decreases to its minimum and then goes to $d-1$. Thus the
quasinormal modes approach the usual AdS modes in the limit $r_+ -> 0$. This
agrees with suggestions of Horowitz et al (Phys.Rev. D62 024027 (2000)).
