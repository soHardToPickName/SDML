Regular basis and R-matrices for the su(n)_k Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
  equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamical R-matrix relations are derived for the group-valued chiral vertex
operators in the SU(n) WZNW model from the KZ equation for a general four-point
function including two step operators. They fit the exchange relations for the
U_q(sl_n) covariant quantum matrix derived previously by solving the dynamical
Yang-Baxter equation. As a byproduct, we extend the regular basis introduced
earlier for SU(2) chiral fields to SU(n) step operators and display the
corresponding triangular matrix representation of the braid group.
