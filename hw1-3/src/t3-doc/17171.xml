Stability of the non-extremal enhancon solution I: perturbation
  equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the stability of the two branches of non-extremal enhancon
solutions. We argue that one would expect a transition between the two branches
at some value of the non-extremality, which should manifest itself in some
instability. We study small perturbations of these solutions, constructing a
sufficiently general ansatz for linearised perturbations of the non-extremal
solutions, and show that the linearised equations are consistent. We show that
the simplest kind of perturbation does not lead to any instability. We reduce
the problem of studying the more general spherically symmetric perturbation to
solving a set of three coupled second-order differential equations.
