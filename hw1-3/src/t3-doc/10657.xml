<title>
Mirror symmetry and deformation quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  The paper is devoted to the comparison of the Fukaya category (it is
responcible for the A-side of mirror symmetry) with the category of holonomic
modules over the quantized algebra of functions on the same symplectic
manifold. We conjecture that these categories become $A_{\infty}$-equivalent
after a twist by a kind of integral transformation.
