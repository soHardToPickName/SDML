<title>
Heat-kernels and functional determinants on the generalized cone
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider zeta functions and heat-kernel expansions on the bounded,
generalized cone in arbitrary dimensions using an improved calculational
technique. The specific case of a global monopole is analysed in detail and
some restrictions thereby placed on the $A_{5/2}$ coefficient. The computation
of functional determinants is also addressed. General formulas are given and
known results are incidentally, and rapidly, reproduced.
