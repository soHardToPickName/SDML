<title>
Noncommutative geometry and quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine some recent developments in noncommutative geometry, including
spin geometries on noncommutative tori and their quantization by the
Shale-Stinespring procedure, as well as the emergence of Hopf algebras as a
tool linking index theory and renormalization calculations
