<title>
Exchange Operator Formalism for Integrable Systems of Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate one dimensional many-body integrable systems in terms of a new
set of phase space variables involving exchange operators. The hamiltonian in
these variables assumes a decoupled form. This greatly simplifies the
derivation of the conserved charges and the proof of their commutativity at the
quantum level.
