Tunneling and Nucleation Rate in the (\lambda\phi^4/4! +
  \sigma\phi^6/6!)_3 Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate both the vacuum decay rate at zero temperature and the finite
temperature nucleation rate for the $(\lambda\phi^4/4! + \sigma\phi^6/6!)_{3D}$
model. Using the thin-wall approximation, we obtain the bounce solution for the
model and we were also able to give the approximate eigenvalue equations for
the bounce.
