<title>
Non-trivial Fixed Points of The Renormalization Group in Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We start a systematic analysis of supersymmetric field theories in six
dimensions. We find necessary conditions for the existence of non-trivial
interacting fixed points. String theory provides us with examples of such
theories. We conjecture that there are many other examples.
