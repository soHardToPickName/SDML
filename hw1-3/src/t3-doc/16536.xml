<title>
Manifestly covariant action for symmetric Chern-Simons field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a three-dimensional symmetric Chern-Simons field theory with a
general covariance and it turns out that the original Chern-Simons theory is
just a gauge fixed action of the symmetric Chern-Simons theory whose constraint
algebra belongs to fully first class constraint system. The Abelian
Chern-Simons theory with matter coupling is studied for the construction of
anyon operators without any ordering ambiguity with the help of this symmetric
Chern-Simons action. Finally we shall discuss some connections between the
present symmetric formulation of Chern-Simons theory and the St\"ukelberg
mechanism.
