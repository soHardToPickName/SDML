Gravity's Rainbow: Limits for the applicability of the equivalence
  principle
</title>

<abstract>
  Limits for the applicability of the equivalence principle are considered in
the context of low-energy effective field theories. In particular, we find a
class of higher-derivative interactions for the gravitational and
electromagnetic fields which produce dispersive photon propagation. The latter
is illustrated by calculating the energy-dependent contribution to the
deflection of light rays.
