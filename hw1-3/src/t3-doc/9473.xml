Clifford Algebra of Spacetime and the Conformal Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the emergence of the conformal group SO(4,2) from the Clifford
algebra of spacetime. A Clifford space (that contains spacetime, in particular)
does not contain only points (events), but also lines, surfaces, volumes, etc..
All those geometric objects are very elegantly and compactly described by means
of the geometric calculus based on Clifford algebra. A subgroup of the Clifford
algebra of spacetime is the conformal group SO(4,2) which can naturally be
given the active interpretation. To finalize we show why relativity in Clifford
spaces implies {\it scale} changes of physical objects as a result of free
motion, without the presence of forces, advocated long ago by one of us. This
represents a true {\it dilatational} motion of physical objects in Clifford
spaces.
