D3-brane action in a supergravity background: the fermionic story
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the kappa-symmetric action for a D3-brane, we study the interaction
between its world-volume fermions and a bosonic type IIB supergravity
background preserving 4-dimensional Lorentz invariance. We find that the
renormalizable terms in the action include only coupling between the fermions
and the 3-form flux in the combination *G_3-iG_3, which is zero for a class of
supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric solutions. We also find the magnetic and
electric dipole moments for the fermions, which are proportional to the
derivative of the dilaton-axion. We show that different gauges to fix the
kappa-symmetry give the same interaction terms, and prove that these terms are
also SL(2,R) self-dual. We interpret our results in terms of N=1 supersymmetric
gauge theory on the D-brane.
