Macroconstraints from Microsymmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamics governing the evolution of a many body system is constrained by
a nonabelian local symmetry. We obtain explicit forms of the global macroscopic
condition assuring that at the microscopic level the evolution respects the
overall symmetry constraint.
