<title>
The geometry of supersymmetric coset models and superconformal algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  An on-shell formulation of (p,q), 2\leq p \leq 4, 0\leq q\leq 4,
supersymmetric coset models with target space the group G and gauge group a
subgroup H of G is given. It is shown that there is a correspondence between
the number of supersymmetries of a coset model and the geometry of the coset
space G/H. The algebras of currents of supersymmetric coset models are
superconformal algebras. In particular, the algebras of currents of (2,2) and
(4,0) supersymmetric coset models are related to the N=2 Kazama-Suzuki and N=4
Van Proeyen superconformal algebras correspondingly.
