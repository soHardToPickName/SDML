Noncommutative Gauge Theory, Divergences and Closed Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the renormalization of non-commutative gauge theories with matter.
 As in the scalar field theory cases, there are logarithmic infrared
divergences resulting from integrating out high momentum modes. In order to
reproduce the correct infrared behaviour, the Wilsonian effective action has to
include certain ''closed string`` modes with prescribed couplings.
  In the case of quiver gauge theories, realized in string theory on orbifolds,
we identify the required modes with a set of twisted sector fields. These
closed string modes have exactly the prescribed couplings to correct the
Wilsonian effective action. This provides a concrete origin for the appearance
of closed string modes in noncommutative field theories.
