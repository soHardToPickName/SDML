<title>
The elliptic genus of Calabi-Yau 3- and 4-folds, product formulae and
  generalized Kac-Moody algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the elliptic genus for a general Calabi-Yau fourfold is
derived. The recent work of Kawai calculating N=2 heterotic string one-loop
threshold corrections with a Wilson line turned on is extended to a similar
computation where K3 is replaced by a general Calabi-Yau 3- or 4-fold. In all
cases there seems to be a generalized Kac-Moody algebra involved, whose
denominator formula appears in the result.
