Some Problems Concerning Interchange of Order of Integration in
  Functional Integral Formalism of U(1) Gauge Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in the functional integral formalism of U(1) gauge field theory
some formal manipulation such as interchange of order of integration can yield
erroneous results. The example studied is analysed by Fubini theorem.
