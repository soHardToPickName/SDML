<title>
Black hole fermionic radiance and D brane decay
</title>

<abstract>
  The semiclassical grey-body factor for massless fermion emission from the
four dimensional black hole described by an ensemble of intersecting triplets
of D- five-branes is shown to be consistent with the (statistical) decay rate
of the branes (in the `long' D-string approximation) into massless fermionic
closed string states, subject to assumptions regarding the energy distribution
of colliding open string states.
