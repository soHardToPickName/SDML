Effective Superpotentials for SO/Sp with Flavor from Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study matrix models related to $SO/Sp$ gauge theories with flavors. We
give the effective superpotentials for gauge theories with arbitrary tree level
superpotential up to first instanton level. For quartic tree level
superpotential we obtained exact one-cut solution. We also derive
Seiberg-Witten curve for these gauge theories from matrix model argument.
