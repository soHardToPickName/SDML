<title>
Finite temperature regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a non-perturbative regularization scheme for Quantum Field
Theories which amounts to an embedding of the originally unregularized theory
into a spacetime with an extra compactified dimensions of length L ~
Lambda^{-1} (with Lambda an ultraviolet cutoff), plus a doubling in the number
of fields, which satisfy different periodicity conditions and have opposite
Grassmann parity. The resulting regularized action may be interpreted, for the
fermionic case, as corresponding to a finite-temperature theory with a
supersymmetry, which is broken because of the boundary conditions. We test our
proposal in a perturbative calculation (the vacuum polarization graph for a
D-dimensional fermionic theory) and in a non-perturbative one (the chiral
anomaly).
