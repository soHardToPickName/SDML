<title>
Newtonian M(atrix) Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  A Newtonian matrix cosmology, correspoding to the BFSS model of
eleven-dimensional M-theory in the IMF as a (0+1) M(atrix) model is
constructed. Interesting new results are obtained, such as the existence of
(much sought for in the past) static solutions. The possible interpretation of
the off-diagonal entries as a background geometry is also briefly discussed.
