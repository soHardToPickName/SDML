Standard-Model Bundles on Non-Simply Connected Calabi--Yau Threefolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a proof of the existence of $G=SU(5)$, stable holomorphic vector
bundles on elliptically fibered Calabi--Yau threefolds with fundamental group
$\bbz_2$. The bundles we construct have Euler characteristic 3 and an anomaly
that can be absorbed by M-theory five-branes. Such bundles provide the basis
for constructing the standard model in heterotic M-theory. They are also
applicable to vacua of the weakly coupled heterotic string. We explicitly
present a class of three family models with gauge group $SU(3)_C\times
SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$.
