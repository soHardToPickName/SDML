<title>
Chern-Simons and Twisted Supersymmetry in Higher Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe special supersymmetric gauge theories in three, five, seven and
nine dimensions, whose compactification on two-, four-, six- and eight-folds
produces a supersymmetric quantum mechanics on moduli spaces of holomorphic
bundles and/or solutions to the analogues of instanton equations in higher
dimensions. The theories may occur on the worldvolumes of D-branes wrapping
manifolds of special holonomy. We also discuss the theories with matter.
