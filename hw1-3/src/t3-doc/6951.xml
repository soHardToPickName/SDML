Vacuum instability in external fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study particles creation in arbitrary space-time dimensions by external
electric fields, in particular, by fields, which are acting for a finite time.
The time and dimensional analysis of the vacuum instability is presented. It is
shown that the distributions of particles created by quasiconstant electric
fields can be written in a form which has a thermal character and seems to be
universal. Its application, for example, to the particles creation in external
constant gravitational field reproduces the Hawking temperature exactly.
