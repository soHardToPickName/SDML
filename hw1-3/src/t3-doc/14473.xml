<title>
Entropy of Extremal Dyonic Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  For extremal charged black holes, the thermodynamic entropy is proportional
not to the area but to the mass or charges. This is demonstrated here for
dyonic extremal black hole solutions of string theory. It is pointed out that
these solutions have zero classical action although the area is nonzero. By
combining the general form of the entropy allowed by thermodynamics with recent
observations in the literature it is possible to fix the entropy almost
completely.
