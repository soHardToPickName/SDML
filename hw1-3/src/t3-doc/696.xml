D-Strings on D-Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the mechanism for appearance of massless solitons in type II string
compactifications. We find that by combining $T$-duality with strong/weak
duality of type IIB in 10 dimensions enhanced gauge symmetries and massless
solitonic hypermultiplets encountered in Calabi-Yau compactifications can be
studied perturbatively using D-strings (the strong/weak dual to type IIB
string) compactified on ``D-manifolds''. In particular the nearly massless
solitonic states of the type IIB compactifications correspond to elementary
states of D-strings. As examples we consider the D-string description of
enhanced gauge symmetries for type IIA string compactification on ALE spaces
with $A_n$ singularities and type IIB on a class of singular Calabi-Yau
threefolds. The class we study includes as a special case the conifold
singularity in which case the perturbative spectrum of the D-string includes
the expected massless hypermultiplet with degeneracy one.
