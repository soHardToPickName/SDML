Effective field theory of slowly-moving "extreme black holes"
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the non-relativistic effective field theory of ``extreme black
holes'' in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with an arbitrary dilaton
coupling. We investigate finite-temperature behavior of gas of ``extreme black
holes'' using the effective theory. The total energy of the classical many-body
system is also derived.
