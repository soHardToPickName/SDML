A Note on "Irreducible" p-Form Gauge Theories with Stueckelberg Coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  p-form gauge theories with Stueckelberg coupling are quantized in an
irreducible antifield-BRST way. As a consequence, neither the ghosts of ghosts
nor their antifields appear. Some irreducible gauge conditions are inferred
naturally within our formalism. In the end we briefly discuss the interacting
case.
