<title>
Topological contributions in two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory: from
  group averages to integration over algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that keeping only the topologically trivial contribution to the
average of a class function on U(N) amounts to integrating over its algebra.
The goal is reached first by decompactifying an expansion over the instanton
basis and then directly, by means of a geometrical procedure.
