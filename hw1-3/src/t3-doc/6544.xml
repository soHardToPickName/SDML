<title>
One-Loop N-Point Superstring Amplitudes with Manifest d=4 Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The hybrid formalism for the superstring is used to compute one-loop
amplitudes with an arbitrary number of external d=4 supergravity states. These
one-loop N-point amplitudes are expressed as Koba-Nielsen-like formulas with
manifest d=4 supersymmetry.
