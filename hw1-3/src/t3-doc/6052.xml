Single particle Green's function in the Calogero-Sutherland model for
  rational couplings $\beta=p/q$
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive an exact expression for the single particle Green function in the
Calogero-Sutherland model for all rational values of the coupling $\beta$. The
calculation is based on Jack polynomial techniques and the results are given in
the thermodynamical limit. Two type of intermediate states contribute. The
firts one consists of a particle propagating out of the Fermi sea and the
second one consists of a particle propagating in one direction, q particles in
the opposite direction and p holes.
