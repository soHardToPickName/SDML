<title>
The classical r-matrix method for nonlinear sigma-model
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical Poisson structure of nonlinear sigma-model is presented as a
Lie-Poisson r-matrix bracket on coadjoint orbits. It is shown that the Poisson
structure of this model is determined by some `hidden singularities' of the Lax
matrix.
