About some exact solutions for 2+1 gravity coupled to gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Some exact static solutions for Einstein gravity in 2+1 dimensions coupled to
abelian gauge field are discussed. Some of these solutions are
three-dimensional analogs of the Schwarzschild black holes. The metrics in the
regions inside and outside the horison are connected by the changing of the
Planck mass sign.
