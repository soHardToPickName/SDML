<title>
On the holomorphic factorization for superconformal fields
</title>

<abstract>
  For a generic value of the central charge, we prove the holomorphic
factorization of partition functions for free superconformal fields which are
defined on a compact Riemann surface without boundary. The partition functions
are viewed as functionals of the Beltrami coefficients and their fermionic
partners which variables parametrize superconformal classes of metrics.
