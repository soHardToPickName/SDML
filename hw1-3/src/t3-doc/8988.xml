<title>
$\varphif_{4}^{4}-$theory for antisymmetric tensor matter fields in
  Minkowski space-time
</title>

<abstract>
The nonabelian generalization of a recently proposed abelian axial gauge model
for tensor matter fields is obtained. In both cases the model can be derived
from a $\vf^{4}-$type theory for antisymmetric fields obeying a complex
self-dual condition.
