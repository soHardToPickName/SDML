<title>
Spin-2 gauge theories and perturbative gauge invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of causal perturbation theory we analyze the gauge structure
of a massless self-interacting quantum tensor field. We look at this theory
from a pure field theoretical point of view without assuming any geometrical
aspect from general relativity. To first order in the perturbation expansion of
the $S$-matrix we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for such a theory
to be gauge invariant, by which we mean that the gauge variation of the
self-coupling with respect to the gauge charge operator $Q$ is a divergence in
the sense of vector analysis. The most general trilinear self-coupling of the
graviton field turns out to be the one derived from the Einstein-Hilbert action
plus divergences and coboundaries.
