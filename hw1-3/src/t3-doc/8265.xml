Deformed Coset Models From Gauged WZW Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  A general Lagrangian formulation of integrably deformed G/H-coset models is
given. We consider the G/H-coset model in terms of the gauged
Wess-Zumino-Witten action and obtain an integrable deformation by adding a
potential energy term $Tr(gTg^{-1}\Tb )$, where algebra elements $T, \Tb $
belong to the center of the algebra {\bf h} associated with the subgroup H. We
show that the classical equation of motion of the deformed coset model can be
identified with the integrability condition of certain linear equations which
makes the use of the inverse scattering method possible. Using the linear
equation, we give a systematic way to construct infinitely many conserved
currents as well as soliton solutions. In the case of the parafermionic
SU(2)/U(1)-coset model, we derive $n$-solitons and conserved currents
explicitly.
