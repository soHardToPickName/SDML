Local BRST cohomology in minimal D=4, N=1 supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The local BRST cohomology is computed in old and new minimal supergravity,
including the coupling to Yang-Mills gauge multiplets. This covers the
determination of all gauge invariant local actions for these models, the
classification of all the possible counterterms that are invariant on-shell, of
all candidate gauge anomalies, and of the possible nontrivial (continuous)
deformations of the standard actions and gauge transformations. Among others it
is proved that in old minimal supergravity the most general gauge invariant
action can indeed be constructed from well-known superspace integrals, whereas
in new minimal supergravity there are only a few additional (but important)
contributions which cannot be constructed in this way without further ado.
Furthermore the results indicate that supersymmetry itself is not anomalous in
minimal supergravity and show that the gauge transformations are extremely
stable under consistent deformations of the models. There is however an unusual
deformation converting new into old minimal supergravity with local
R-invariance which is reminiscent of a duality transformation.
