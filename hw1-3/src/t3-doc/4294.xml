Non-Abelian Axial-Vector Duality: a Geometric Description
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a geometric characterization of the quasi axial-vector
(Kiritsis-Obers) target space duality in the spirit of the bi-algebra
(Klimcik-Severa) approach. We show that the sigma-models constructed by taking
quotients have non-abelian chiral currents that obey "non-commutative
conservation laws" and provide the criterion for a sigma-model to have a dual
using the axial-vector procedure.
