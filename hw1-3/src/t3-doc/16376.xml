Improved Epstein-Glaser renormalization in coordinate space I. Euclidean
  framework
</title>

<abstract>
  In a series of papers, we investigate the reformulation of Epstein-Glaser
renormalization in coordinate space, both in analytic and Hopf algebraic terms.
This first article deals with analytical aspects. Some of the historically good
reasons for the divorces of the Epstein-Glaser method, both from mainstream
quantum field theory and the mathematical literature on distributions, are made
plain; and overcome.
