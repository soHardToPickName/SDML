<title>
Quantum properties of general gauge theories with composite and external
  fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The generating functionals of Green's functions with composite and external
fields are considered in the framework of BV and BLT quantization methods for
general gauge theories. The corresponding Ward identities are derived and the
gauge dependence is investigated
