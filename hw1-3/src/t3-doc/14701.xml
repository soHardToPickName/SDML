Gravity and Electromagnetism in Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a unified description of gravity and electromagnetism in the
framework of a $Z_2$ noncommutative differential calculus. It can be considered
as a ``discrete version" of Kaluza-Klein theory, where the fifth continuous
dimension is replaced by two discrete points. We derive an action which
coincides with the dimensionally reduced one of the ordinary Kaluza-Klein
theory.
