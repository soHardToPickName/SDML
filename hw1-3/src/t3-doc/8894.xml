<title>
Cosmology of a brane radiating gravitons into the extra dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  We study in a self-consistent way the impact of the emission of bulk
gravitons on the (homogeneous) cosmology of a three-brane embedded in a
five-dimensional spacetime. In the low energy regime, we recover the well known
result that the bulk affects the Friedmann equation only via a radiation-like
term $\C/a^4$, called dark or Weyl radiation. By contrast, in the high energy
regime, we find that the Weyl parameter $\C$ is no longer constant but instead
grows very rapidly as $\C\propto a^4$. As a consequence, the value of $\C$
today is not a free parameter as usually considered but is a fixed number,
which, generically, depends only on the number of relativistic degrees of
freedom at the high/low energy transition. Our estimated amount of Weyl
radiation satisfies the present nucleosynthesis bounds.
