D-Branes on the Null-Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study D-branes in the null-brane background. Using the covariant formalism
of the worldsheet theory, we construct the boundary states describing D-branes
on the null-brane. From the cylinder amplitudes, we find that the D-branes with
codimension zero or two have time-dependent effective tensions.
