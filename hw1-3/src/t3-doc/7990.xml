On Large N Conformal Theories, Field Theories in Anti-De Sitter Space
  and Singletons
</title>

<abstract>
  It was proposed by Maldacena that the large $N$ limit of certain conformal
field theories can be described in terms of supergravity on anti-De Sitter
spaces (AdS). Recently, Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov and Witten have
conjectured that the generating functional for certain correlation functions in
conformal field theory is given by the classical supergravity action on AdS. It
was shown that the spectra of states of the two theories are matched and the
two-point correlation function was studied. We discuss the interacting case and
compare the three- and four-point correlation functions computed from a
classical action on AdS with the large N limit of conformal theory. We discuss
also the large N limit for the Wilson loop and suggest that singletons which
according to Flato and Fronsdal are constituents of composite fields in
spacetime should obey the quantum Boltzmann statistics.
