<title>
Dirac Operators and Clifford Geometry - New Unifying Principles in
  Particle Physics ?
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture I will report on some recent progress in understanding the
relation of Dirac operators on Clifford modules over an even-dimensional closed
Riemannian manifold $M$\ and (euclidean) Einstein-Yang-Mills-Higgs models.
