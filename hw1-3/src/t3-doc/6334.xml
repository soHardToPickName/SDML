Partition functions and Jacobi fields in the Morse theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the semiclassical partition function in the frame work of the Morse
theory, to clarify the phase factor of the partition function and to relate it
to the eta invariant of Atiyah. Converting physical system with potential into
a curved manifold, we exploit the Jacobi fields and their corresponding
eigenvalue equations to be associated with geodesics on the curved manifold and
the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.
