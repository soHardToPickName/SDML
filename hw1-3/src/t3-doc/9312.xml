Field Anti-Field Duality, p-Form Gauge Fields and Topological Field
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a framework which unifyies in dual pairs the fields and
anti-fields of the Batalin and Vilkovisky quantization method. We consider
gauge theories of p-forms coupled to Yang-Mills fields. Our algorithm generates
many topological models of the Chern-Simon type or of the Donaldson-Witten
type. Some of these models can undergo a partial breaking of their topological
symmetries.
