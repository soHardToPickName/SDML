Characters of admissible representations of the affine superalgebra
  sl(2|1)
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate characters and supercharacters for irreducible, admissible
representations of the affine superalgebra sl(2|1) in both the Ramond and
Neveu-Schwarz sectors and discuss their modular properties in the special case
of level k=-1/2. We also show that the non-degenerate integrable characters
coincide with some N=4 superconformal characters.
