Brane Cube Realization of Three-dimensional Nonabelian Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study D-branes on three-dimensional orbifolds ${\bf C}^3/\Gamma$ where
$\Gamma$ are finite subgroups of SU(3). The quiver diagram of $\ZnZn \in SU(3)$
can be expressed in three-dimensional form. According to the correspondence
between quiver diagrams and brane configurations, we construct a brane
configuration for ${\bf C}^3/\ZnZn$ which has essentially three-dimensional
structrue. Brane configurations for nonabelian orbifolds $\C^3/\Delta(3n^2)$
and $\C^3/\Delta(6n^2)$ are obtained from that for $\C^3/\ZnZn$ by certain
quotienting procedure.
