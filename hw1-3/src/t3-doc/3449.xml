A note on the torsion dependence of D-brane RR couplings
</title>

<abstract>
  The dependence on the torsion H=db of the Wess-Zumino couplings of D-branes
that are trivially embedded in space-time is studied. We show that even in this
simple set-up some torsion components can be turned on, with a non-trivial
effect on the RR couplings. In the special cases in which either the tangent or
the normal bundle are trivial, the torsion dependence amounts to substitute the
standard curvature with its generalization in the presence of torsion, in the
usual couplings involving the roof genus A.
