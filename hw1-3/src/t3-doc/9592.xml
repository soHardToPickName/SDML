<title>
(2,2) Supergravity in the Light-Cone gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with the prepotential description of two-dimensional $(2,2)$
supergravity we use local supersymmetry transformations to go to light-cone
gauge. We discuss properties of the theory in this gauge and derive Ward
identities for correlation functions defined with respect to the induced
supergravity action.
