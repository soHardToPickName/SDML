<title>
On the Calculation of Effective Actions by String Methods
</title>

<abstract>
  Strassler's formulation of the string-derived Bern-Kosower formalism is
reconsidered with particular emphasis on effective actions and form factors.
Two- and three point form factors in the nonabelian effective action are
calculated and compared with those obtained in the heat kernel approach of
Barvinsky, Vilkovisky et al. We discuss the Fock-Schwinger gauge and propose a
manifestly covariant calculational scheme for one-loop effective actions in
gauge theory.
