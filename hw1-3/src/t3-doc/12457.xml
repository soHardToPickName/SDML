Topics in Born-Infeld Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical version of Born-Infeld electrodynamics is recalled and its most
important properties discussed. Then we analyze possible abelian and
non-abelian generalizations of this theory, and show how certain soliton-like
configurations can be obtained. The relationship with the Standard Model of
electroweak interactions is also mentioned.
