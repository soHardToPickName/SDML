A note on half-supersymmetric bound states in M-theory and type IIA
</title>

<abstract>
  By using O(7,7) transformations, to deform D6-branes, we obtain
half-supersymmetric bound state solutions of type IIA supergravity, containing
D6, D4, D2, D0, F1-branes and waves. We lift the solutions to M-theory which
gives half-supersymmetric M-theory bound states, e.g. KK6-M5-M5-M5-M2-M2-M2-MW.
We also take near horizon limits for the type IIA solutions, which gives
supergravity duals of 7-dimensional non-commutative open string theory (with
space-time and space-space non-commutativity), non-commutative Yang-Mills
theory (with space-space and light-like non-commutativity) and an open D4-brane
theory.
