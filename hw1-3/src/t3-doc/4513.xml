<title>
Chern-Simons as a geometrical set up for three dimensional gauge
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Three dimensional Yang-Mills gauge theories in the presence of the
Chern-Simons action are seen as being generated by the pure topological
Chern-Simons term through nonlinear covariant redefinitions of the gauge field
