QED_{2+1}: Compton effect on Dirac-Landau electrons
</title>

<abstract>
  Planar Quantum Electrodynamics is developed when charged fermions are under
the influence of a constant and homogeneous external magnetic field. We compute
the cross-length for the scattering of optical/ultraviolet photons by
Dirac-Landau electrons.
