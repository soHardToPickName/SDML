<title>
Stable Non-BPS States and Their Holographic Duals
</title>

<abstract>
  Stable non-BPS states can be constructed and studied in a variety of contexts
in string theory. Here we review some interesting constructions that arise from
suspended and wrapped branes. We also exhibit some stable non-BPS states that
have holographic duals.
