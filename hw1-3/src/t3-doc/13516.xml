<title>
Multi-Hamiltonian Structure of Lotka-Volterra and Quantum Volterra
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider evolution equations of the Lotka-Volterra type, and elucidate
especially their formulation as canonical Hamiltonian systems. The general
conditions under which these equations admit several conserved quantities
(multi-Hamiltonians) are analysed. A special case, which is related to the
Liouville model on a lattice, is considered in detail, both as aclassical and
as aquantal system
