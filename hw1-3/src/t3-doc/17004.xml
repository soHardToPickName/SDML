Axial Couplings on the World-Line
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a world-line representation for the fermionic one-loop effective
action with axial and also vector, scalar, and pseudo-scalar couplings. We use
this expression to compute a few selected scattering amplitudes. These allow us
to verify that our method yields the same results as standard field theory. In
particular, we are able to reproduce the chiral anomaly. Our starting point is
the second-order formulation for the Dirac fermion. We translate the second
order expressions into a world-line action.
