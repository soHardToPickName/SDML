Yang-Mills instantons on 7-dimensional manifold of G_2 holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate Yang-Mills instantons on a 7-dimensional manifold of G_2
holonomy. By proposing a spherically symmetric ansatz for the Yang-Mills
connection, we have ordinary differential equations as the reduced instanton
equation, and give some explicit and numerical solutions.
