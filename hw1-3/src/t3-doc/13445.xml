<title>
Hecke algebraic approach to the reflection equation for spin chains
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the structural similarity of certain Coxeter Artin Systems to the
Yang--Baxter and Reflection Equations to convert representations of these
systems into new solutions of the Reflection Equation. We construct certain
Bethe ansatz states for these solutions, using a parameterisation suggested by
abstract representation theory.
