Siegel Gauge in Vacuum String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the star algebra of ghost sector in vacuum string field theory
(VSFT). We show that the star product of two states in the Siegel gauge is BRST
exact if we take the BRST charge to be the one found in hep-th/0108150, and the
BRST exact states are nil factors in the star algebra. By introducing a new
star product defined on the states in the Siegel gauge, the equation of motion
of VSFT is characterized as the projection condition with respect to this new
product. We also comment on the comma form of string vertex in the ghost
sector.
