<title>
OPE between the energy-momentum tensor and the Wilson loop in N=4
  Super-Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the operator product expansion T_{\mu \nu}(z) W[C] in N=4
4-dimensional Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with U(N) gauge group, and clarify
that the closed Wilson loop does not possess an anomalous dimension and that
only the shape of the loop is changed by the conformal transformation.
