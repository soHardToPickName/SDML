Comments on Solutions of Vacuum Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study classical solutions of vacuum version of Berkovits' superstring
field theory, focusing on the (super)ghost sector. We first argue that the
supersliver state which is annihilated by eta_0, though it has the correct
quantum numbers and solves the equation of motion, is actually
non-perturbatively pure-gauge, and hence it fails to describe a D-brane. As a
step toward the construction of non-trivial solutions, we calculate
e^{-Phi}Qe^{Phi} for twisted superslivers. As a by-product, we find that the
bc-twisted sliver solution in bosonic VSFT can, at least formally, also be
written as a pure-gauge configuration.
