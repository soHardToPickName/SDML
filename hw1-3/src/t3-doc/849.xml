<title>
Point-splitting regularization of composite operators and anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  The point-splitting regularization technique for composite operators is
discussed in connection with anomaly calculation. We present a pedagogical and
self-contained review of the topic with an emphasis on the technical details.
We also develop simple algebraic tools to handle the path ordered exponential
insertions used within the covariant and non-covariant version of the
point-splitting method. The method is then applied to the calculation of the
chiral, vector, trace, translation and Lorentz anomalies within diverse
versions of the point-splitting regularization and a connection between the
results is described. As an alternative to the standard approach we use the
idea of deformed point-split transformation and corresponding Ward-Takahashi
identities rather than an application of the equation of motion, which seems to
save the complexity of the calculations.
