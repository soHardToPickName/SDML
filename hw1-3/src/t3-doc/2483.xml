<title>
New Conformal Models with $c<2/5$
</title>

<abstract>
  The zoo of two-dimensional conformal models has been supplemented by a series
of nonunitary conformal models obtained by cosetting minimal models. Some of
them coincide with minimal models, some do not have even Kac spectrum of
conformal dimensions.
