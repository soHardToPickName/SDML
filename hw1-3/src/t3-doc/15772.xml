Understanding Chiral Anomaly in Coordinate Space
</title>

<abstract>
  By completing the old discussion of K.~Wilson, we express the chiral anomaly
in terms of a double integral of a three-point function of chiral currents over
an arbitrarily small region in the coordinate space. An integrability condition
provides an important finite local counterterm to the integral.
