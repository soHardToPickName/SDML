Supersymmetry Breaking with Periodic Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss supersymmetry breaking in some supersymmetric quantum mechanical
models with periodic potentials. The sensitivity to the parameters appearing in
the superpotential is more acute than in conventional nonperiodic models. We
present some simple elliptic models to illustrate these points.
