<title>
Towards a Generalized Distribution Formalism for Gauge Quantum Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that the distributions defined on the Gelfand-Shilov spaces, and
hence more singular than hyperfunctions, retain the angular localizability
property. Specifically, they have uniquely determined support cones. This
result enables one to develop a distribution-theoretic techniques suitable for
the consistent treatment of quantum fields with arbitrarily singular
ultraviolet and infrared behavior. The proofs covering the most general case
are based on the use of the theory of plurisubharmonic functions and
Hormander's estimates.
