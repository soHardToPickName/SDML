<title>
Selberg Supertrace Formula for Super Riemann Surfaces III: Bordered
  Super Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper is the third in a sequel to develop a super-analogue of the
classical Selberg trace formula, the Selberg supertrace formula. It deals with
bordered super Riemann surfaces. The theory of bordered super Riemann surfaces
is outlined, and the corresponding Selberg supertrace formula is developed. The
analytic properties of the Selberg super zeta-functions on bordered super
Riemann surfaces are discussed, and super-determinants of Dirac-Laplace
operators on bordered super Riemann surfaces are calculated in terms of Selberg
super zeta-functions.
