Electron-pair condensation in parity-preserving QED3
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we present a parity-preserving QED3 with spontaneous breaking
of a local U(1)-symmetry. The breaking is accomplished by a potential of the
\vf^6-type. It is shown that a net attractive interaction appears in the
M{\o}ller scattering (s and p-wave scattering between two electrons) as
mediated by the gauge field and a Higgs scalar. This might favour a
pair-condensation mechanism.
