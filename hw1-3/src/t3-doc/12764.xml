Spinning Bound States of Two and Three Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Bound states of BPS particles in five-dimensional N=2 supergravity are
counted by a topological index. We compute this bound state index exactly for
two and three black holes as a function of the SU(2)_L angular momentum. The
required regulator for the infrared continuum of near-coincident black holes is
chosen in accord with the enhanced superconformal symmetry.
