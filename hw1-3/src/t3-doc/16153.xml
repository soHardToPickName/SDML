Bootstrap equations and correlation functions for the Heisenberg XYZ
  antiferromagnet
</title>

<abstract>
  Presented are two kinds of integral solutions to the quantum
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations for the 2n-point correlation functions of the
Heisenberg XYZ antiferromagnet. Our first integral solution can be obtained
from those for the cyclic SOS model by using the vertex-face correspondence. By
the construction, the sum with respect to the local height variables k_0, k_1,
>..., k_{2n} of the cyclic SOS model remains other than n-fold integral in the
first solution. In order to perform those summations, we improve that to find
the second integral solution of (r+1)n-fold integral for r in Z_{>1}, where r
is a parameter of the XYZ model. Furthermore, we discuss the relations among
our formula, Lashkevich-Pugai's formula and Shiraishi's one.
