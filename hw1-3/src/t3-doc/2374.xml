Composite fields, generalized hypergeometric functions and the $U(1)_Y$
  symmetry in the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the concept of composite fields in flat CFT as well as in the
context of AdS/CFT. Furthermore we show how to represent Green functions using
generalized hypergeometric functions and apply these techniques to four-point
functions. Finally we prove an identity of $U(1)_Y$ symmetry for four-point
functions.
