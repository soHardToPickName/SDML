<title>
Nonperturbative Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonperturbative approach for spontaneous symmetry breaking is proposed. It
is based on some properties of interacting field operators. As the consequences
an additional terms like to m^2 A^2 appears in the initial Lagrangian.
