<title>
Brane Probes, Toric Geometry, and Closed String Tachyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study non-supersymmetric orbifold singularities from the point of view of
D-brane probes. We present a description of the decay of such singularities
from considerations of the toric geometry of the probe branes.
