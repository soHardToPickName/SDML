6D trace anomalies from quantum mechanical path integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the recently developed dimensional regularization (DR) scheme for
quantum mechanical path integrals in curved space and with a finite time
interval to compute the trace anomalies for a scalar field in six dimensions.
This application provides a further test of the DR method applied to quantum
mechanics. It shows the efficiency in higher loop computations of having to
deal with covariant counterterms only, as required by the DR scheme.
