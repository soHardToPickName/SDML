<title>
S-Duality Constraints On Effective Potentials For Gaugino Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify the role of approximate S-duality in effective supergravity
theories that are the low energy limits of string theories, and show how this
partial symmetry may be used to constrain effective lagrangians for gaugino
condensation.
