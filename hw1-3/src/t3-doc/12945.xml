<title>
The extended conformal theory of Luttinger systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the recently introduced method of algebraic bosonization of the
$(1+1)$-dimensional Luttinger systems by discussing in detail the specific case
of the Calogero-Sutherland model, and mentioning the hard-core Bose gas. We
also compare our findings with the exact Bethe Ansatz results.
