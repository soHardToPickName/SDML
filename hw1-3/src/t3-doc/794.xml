<title>
Massive Two-Dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we study the zero-charge sector of massive two-dimensional
Quantum Chromodynamics in the decoupled formulation. We find that some general
features of the massless theory, concerning the constraints and the right- and
left-moving character of the corresponding BRST currents, survive in the
massive case. The implications for the integrability properties previously
valid in the massless case, and the structure of the Hilbert space are
discussed.
