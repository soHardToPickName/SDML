<title>
Differential geometry of the space of orbits of a Coxeter group
</title>

<abstract>
  Differential-geometric structures on the space of orbits of a finite Coxeter
group, determined by Groth\'endieck residues, are calculated. This gives a
construction of a 2D topological field theory for an arbitrary Coxeter group.
