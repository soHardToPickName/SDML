D-branes, B fields, and Ext groups
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we extend previous work on calculating massless boundary Ramond
sector spectra of open strings to include cases with nonzero flat B fields. In
such cases, D-branes are no longer well-modelled precisely by sheaves, but
rather they are replaced by `twisted' sheaves, reflecting the fact that gauge
transformations of the B field act as affine translations of the Chan-Paton
factors. As in previous work, we find that the massless boundary Ramond sector
states are counted by Ext groups -- this time, Ext groups of twisted sheaves.
As before, the computation of BRST cohomology relies on physically realizing
some spectral sequences. Subtleties that cropped up in previous work also
appear here.
