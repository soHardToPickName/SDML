Supertubes connecting D4 branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find and explore a class of dyonic instanton solutions which can be
identified as the supertubes connecting two D4 branes. They correspond to a
single monopole string and a pair of monopole antimonopole strings from the
worldvolume view point of D4 branes.
