Nahm's equations and root systems
</title>

<abstract>
  A method of deriving solutions to Nahm's equations based on root structure of
simple Lie algebras is given. As an illustration of this method the recently
found solutions to Nahm's equations with tetrahedral and octahedral symmetries
are shown to correspond to $A_2$ and $A_3$ root systems.
