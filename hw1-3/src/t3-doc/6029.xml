<title>
The embedding structure and the shift operator of the U(1) lattice
  current algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of block-spin embeddings of the U(1) lattice current algebra is
described. For an odd number of lattice sites, the inner realizations of the
shift automorphism areclassified. We present a particular inner shift operator
which admits a factorization involving quantum dilogarithms analogous to the
results of Faddeev and Volkov.
