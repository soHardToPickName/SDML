<title>
A Universal Lagrangian for Massive Yang-Mills Theories without Higgs
  Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  A universal Lagrangian that defines various four-dimensional massive
Yang-Mills theories without Higgs bosons is presented. Each of the theories is
characterized by a constant k contained in the Lagrangian. For k=0, the
Lagrangian reduces to one defining the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory,
and for k=1, the Lagrangian reduces to one defining the Freedman-Townsend
model. New massive Yang-Mills theories are obtained by choosing k to be real
numbers other than 0 and 1.
