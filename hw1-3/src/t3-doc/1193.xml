From Dynamical to Numerical R-Matrices: A Case Study for the Calogero
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the class of integrable Calogero models associated with (semi-)simple
Lie algebras and with symmetric pairs of Lie algebras identified in a previous
paper, we analyze whether and to what extent it is possible to find a gauge
transformation that takes the traditional Lax pair with its dynamical R-matrix
to a new Lax pair with a numerical R-matrix.
