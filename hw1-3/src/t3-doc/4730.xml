<title>
A new method to measure the chiral condensate in lattice QCD using
  Wilson fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Parity and flavor symmetry is not broken in QCD. Using this fact, we propose
a new method to measure the chiral condensate in lattice QCD using Wilson
fermions with an operator that breaks parity and flavor in addition to the
chiral symmetry.
