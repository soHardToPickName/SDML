<title>
Exact Renormalization Group in Algebraic Noncovariant Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  I study a class of Wilsonian formulations of non-Abelian gauge theories in
algebraic noncovariant gauges where the Wilsonian infrared cutoff $\Lambda$ is
inserted as a mass term for the propagating fields. In this way the
Ward-Takahashi identities are preserved to all scales. Nevertheless the
BRS-invariance in broken and the theory is gauge-dependent and unphysical at
$\Lambda\neq0$. Then I discuss the infrared limit $\Lambda\to0$. I show that
the singularities of the axial gauge choice are avoided in planar gauge and in
light-cone gauge. Finally the rectangular Wilson loop of size $2L\times 2T$ is
evaluated at lowest order in perturbation theory and a noncommutativity between
the limits $\Lambda\to0$ and $T\to\infty$ is pointed out.
