Theta-Vacua in the Light-Front Quantized Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The light-front (LF) quantization of the bosonized Schwinger model is
discussed in the "continuum formulation". The proposal, successfully used
earlier for describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) on the LF, of
separating first the scalar field into the dynamical condensate and the
fluctuation fields before employing the "standard" Dirac method works here as
well. The condensate variable, however, is now shown to be a q-number operator
in contrast to the case of SSB where it was shown to be a c-number or a
background field. The "condensate or Theta-vacua" emerge straightforwardly
together with their continuum normalization which avoids the violation of the
cluster decomposition property in the theory. Some topics on the "front form"
theory are summarized in the Appendices and attention is drawn to the fact that
"the theory quantized, say, at equal $x^{+}$ seems already to carry information
on equal $x^{-}$ commutators as well".
