<title>
On the Supersymmetric Index of the M-theory 5-brane and Little String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a six-dimensional framework to calculate the supersymmetric index
of M-theory 5-branes wrapped on a six-manifold with product topology $M_4\times
T^2$, where $M_4$ is a holomorphic 4-cycle in a Calabi-Yau three-fold. This is
obtained by zero-modes counting of the self-dual tensor contribution plus
``little'' string states and correctly reproduces the known results which can
be obtained by shrinking or blowing the $T^2$ volume parameter. We also extract
the geometric moduli space of the multi M5-brane system and infer the generic
structure of the supersymmetric index for more general geometries.
