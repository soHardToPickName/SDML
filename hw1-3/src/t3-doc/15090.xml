<title>
Superconformal algebras and Lie superalgebras of the Hodge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We observe a correspondence between the zero modes of superconformal algebras
$S'(2, 1)$ and W(4) and the Lie superalgebras formed by classical operators
appearing in the K{\"a}hler and hyper-K{\"a}hler geometry.
