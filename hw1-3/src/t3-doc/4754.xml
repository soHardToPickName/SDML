Algebraic Aspects of Bethe-Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lectures the introduction to algebraic aspects of Bethe Ansatz is
given. The applications to the seminal spin 1/2 XXX model is discussed in
detail and the generalization to higher spin as well as XXZ and lattice
Sine-Gordon model are indicated. The origin of quantum groups and their
appearance in CFT models is explained. The text can be considered as a guide to
the research papers in this field.
