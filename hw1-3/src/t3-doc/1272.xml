On Target-Space Duality in p-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the target-space duality transformations in $p$--branes as
transformations which mix the worldvolume field equations with Bianchi
identities. We consider an $(m+p+1)$-dimensional spacetime with $p+1$
dimensions compactified, and a particular form of the background fields. We
find that while a $GL(2)=SL(2)\times R$ group is realized when $m=0$, only a
two parameter group is realized when $m>0$.
