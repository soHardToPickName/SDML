Two-dimensional N=1,2 Supersymmetric Chiral and Dual Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional N=1,2 supersymmetric chiral models and their dual extensions
are introduced and canonically quantized. Working within a superspace
formalism, the non-manifest invariance under 2D-superPoincare' transformations
is proven. The N=1,2 superVirasoro algebras are recovered as current algebras.
The non-anomalous quantum invariances under 1D-superdiffeomorphisms (for chiral
models) and N=1,2 superconformal transformations (for dual models) are shown to
be a consequence of an N=1,2 super-Coulomb gas representation.
