On the Role of the Annihilation Channel in Front Form Positronium
</title>

<abstract>
  The annihilation channel is implemented into the front form calculations of
the positronium spectrum presented in a previous publication. The effective
Hamiltonian is calculated analytically. Its eigensolutions are obtained
numerically. A complete separation of the dynamical and instantaneous part of
the annihilation interaction is observed. We find the remarkable effect that
the annihilation channel stabilizes the cutoff behavior of the spectrum.
