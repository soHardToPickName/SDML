Product Integrals and Wilson loops
</title>

<abstract>
  Using product integrals we review the unambiguous mathematical representation
of Wilson line and Wilson loop operators, including their behavior under gauge
transformations and the non-abelian Stokes theorem. Interesting consistency
conditions among Wilson lines are also presented.
