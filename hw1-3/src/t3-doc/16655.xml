<title>
Deformation of Supersymmetric and Conformal Quantum Mechanics Through
  Affine Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  Affine transformations (dilatations and translations) are used to define a
deformation of one-dimensional $N=2$ supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
Resulting physical systems do not have conserved charges and degeneracies in
the spectra. Instead, superpartner Hamiltonians are $q$-isospectral, i.e. the
spectrum of one can be obtained from another (with possible exception of the
lowest level) by $q^2$-factor scaling. This construction allows easily to
rederive a special self-similar potential found by Shabat and to show that for
the latter a $q$-deformed harmonic oscillator algebra of Biedenharn and
Macfarlane serves as the spectrum generating algebra. A general class of
potentials related to the quantum conformal algebra $su_q(1,1)$ is described.
Further possibilities for $q$-deformation of known solvable potentials are
outlined.
