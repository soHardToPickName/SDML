<title>
Resolution of Cosmological Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a class of 3+1 dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
cosmologies can be embedded within a variety of solutions of string theory. In
some realizations the apparent singularities associated with the big bang or
big crunch are resolved at non-singular horizons of higher-dimensional
quasi-black hole solutions (with compactified real time); in others
plausibly they are resolved at D-brane bound states having no conventional
space-time interpretation.
