Composite Operator Effective Potential Approach to QED$_3$
</title>

<abstract>
  The composite operator effective potential is compared with the conventional
Dyson-Schwinger method as a calculational tool for (2+1)-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics. It is found that when the fermion propagator ansatz is put
directly into the effective potential, it reproduces exactly the usual gap
equations derived in the Dyson-Schwinger approach.
