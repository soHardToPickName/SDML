<title>
On the decay law for unstable open systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We use (nonconservative) dynamical semigroups to investigate the decay law of
a quantum unstable system weakly coupled with a large environment. We find that
the deviations from the classical exponential law are small and can be safely
ignored in any actual experiment.
