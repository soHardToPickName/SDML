<title>
Supersymmetry algebra and BPS states of super Yang-Mills theories on
  noncommutative tori
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider 10-dimensional super Yang-Mills theory with topological terms
compactified on a noncommutative torus. We calculate supersymmetry algebra and
derive BPS energy spectra from it. The cases of d-dimensional tori with d=2,3,4
are considered in full detail. SO(d,d|Z)-invariance of the BPS spectrum and
relation of new results to the previous work in this direction are discussed.
