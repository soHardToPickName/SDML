Static Axially Symmetric Solutions of Einstein-Yang-Mills-Dilaton Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct static axially symmetric solutions of SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. Like their spherically symmetric
counterparts, these solutions are nonsingular and asymptotically flat. The
solutions are characterized by the winding number n and the node number k
of the gauge field functions. For fixed n with increasing k the solutions
tend to ``extremal'' Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton black holes with n units of
magnetic charge.
