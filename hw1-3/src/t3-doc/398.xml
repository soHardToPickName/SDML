A comment on the $R^4$-coupling in (M)atrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  By scaling arguments we show that the presence of a $R^4$-term in the eleven
dimensional supergravity effective lagrangian, if it is visible in (M)atrix
theory, should produce a correction to the five-loops effective lagrangian of
two moving D0-branes.
