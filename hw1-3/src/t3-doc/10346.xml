<title>
Production of Vortices by Scattering Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an action that can be used to describe the production of global
vortices in 2+1 dimensions by scattering Nambu-Goldstone bosons. At strong
self-coupling the action reduces to scalar QED with particular values of the
coupling constants and the production cross-section is explicitly found. We
also consider the production of gauged vortices by scattering particles that
have an Aharanov-Bohm interaction with the vortex.
