<title>
Fractional Supersymmetry and Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a set of quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians which can be written as
the $F^{\,\rm th}$ power of a conserved charge: $H=Q^F$ with $[H,Q]=0$ and
$F=2,3,...\, .$ This new construction, which we call {\it fractional}\/
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, is realized in terms of \pg\ variables
satisfying $\t^F=0$. Furthermore, in a pseudo-classical context, we describe
{\it fractional}\/ supersymmetry transformations as the $F^{\,\rm th}$ roots of
time translations, and provide an action invariant under such transformations.
