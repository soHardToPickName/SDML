<title>
An Infinite Set of Tree Amplitudes in Higgs-Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  It is pointed out that the Parke-Taylor or maximally helicity violating
amplitudes in the pure Yang-Mills can, after some specifications, be
interpreted as amplitudes of scattering of massive vector bosons in the
Higgs-Yang-Mills system.
