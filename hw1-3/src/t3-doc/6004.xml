A Note on Intersecting and Fluctuating Solitons in 4D Noncommutative
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the intersections, fluctuations and deformations of codimension
two solitons in field theory on noncommutative $R^4$, in the limit of large
noncommutativity. We find that holomorphic deformations are zero modes of flat
branes, and we show that there is a zero mode localized at the intersection of
two solitons.
