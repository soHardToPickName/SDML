Geometric Quantization of the Phase Space of a Particle in a Yang-Mills
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  The method of geometric quantization is applied to a particle moving on an
arbitrary Riemannian manifold $Q$ in an external gauge field, that is a
connection on a principal $H$-bundle $N$ over $Q$. The phase space of the
particle is a Marsden-Weinstein reduction of $T^*N$, hence this space can also
be considered to be the reduced phase space of a particular type of constrained
mechanical system. An explicit map is found from a subalgebra of the classical
observables to the corresponding quantum operators. These operators are found
to be the generators of a representation of the semi-direct product group,
Aut~$N\lx C^\infty_c(Q)$. A generalised Aharanov-Bohm effect is shown to be a
natural consequence of the quantization procedure. In particular the r\^ole of
the connection in the quantum mechanical system is made clear. The quantization
of the Hamiltonian is also considered. Additionally, our approach allows the
related quantization procedures proposed by Mackey and by Isham to be fully
understood.\\
