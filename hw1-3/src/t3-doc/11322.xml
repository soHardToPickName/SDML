<title>
Noncommutative Geometry and Integrable Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A construction of conservation laws for $\sigma$-models in two dimensions is
generalized in the framework of noncommutative geometry of commutative
algebras. This is done by replacing the ordinary calculus of differential forms
with other differential calculi and introducing an analogue of the Hodge
operator on the latter. The general method is illustrated with several
examples.
