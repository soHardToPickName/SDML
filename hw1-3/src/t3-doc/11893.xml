Supersymmetric D0-Branes in Curved Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  An action for supersymmetric D0-branes in curved backgrounds is obtained by
dimensional reduction of N=1 ten-dimensional supergravity coupled to super
Yang-Mills system to 0+1 dimensions. The resultant action exhibits the
coset-space symmetry $\frac{SO(9,9+n)}{SO(9)\times SO(9+n)}\times U(1)$ where
$n=N^{2}-1$ is the dimension of the SU(N) gauge group.
