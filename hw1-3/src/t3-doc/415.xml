Fundamental Strings as Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  The interpretation of closed fundamental strings as solitons in open string
field theory is reviewed. Noncommutativity is introduced to facilitate an
explicit construction. The tension is computed exactly and the correct spectrum
is recovered at long wave length.
