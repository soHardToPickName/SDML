Consistent deformations of dual formulations of linearized gravity: A
  no-go result
</title>

<abstract>
  The consistent, local, smooth deformations of the dual formulation of
linearized gravity involving a tensor field in the exotic representation of the
Lorentz group with Young symmetry type (D-3,1) (one column of length D-3 and
one column of length 1) are systematically investigated. The rigidity of the
Abelian gauge algebra is first established. We next prove a no-go theorem for
interactions involving at most two derivatives of the fields.
