<title>
Three-body generalization of the Sutherland model with internal degrees
  of freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalized spin Sutherland model including a three-body potential is
proposed. The problem is analyzed in terms of three first-order
differential-difference operators, obtained by combining SUSYQM supercharges
with the elements of the dihedral group~$D_6$. Three alternative commuting
operators are also introduced.
