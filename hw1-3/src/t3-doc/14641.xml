Integrable Perturbations of $W_n$ and WZW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new class of 2d integrable models obtained as perturbations of
minimal CFT with W-symmetry by fundamental weight primaries. These models are
generalisations of well known $(1,2)$-perturbed Virasoro minimal models. In the
large $p$ (number of minimal model) limit they coincide with scalar
perturbations of WZW theories. The algebra of conserved charges is discussed in
this limit. We prove that it is noncommutative and coincides with twisted
affine algebra $G$ represented in a space of asymptotic states. We conjecture
that scattering in these models for generic $p$ is described by $S$-matrix of
the $q$-deformed $G$ - algebra with $q$ being root of unity.
