Axions: Past, Present, and Future
</title>

<abstract>
  I give a pedagogical and historical introduction to axion physics, and
briefly review the present status of axions in our understanding of particle
physics and cosmology. This is a contribution to Continuous Advances in QCD
2002/Arkadyfest, held in honor of Arkady Vainshtein's 60th birthday.
