Duality in Supersymmetric SU(N) Gauge Theory with a Symmetric Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  Duality in supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory with a symmetric tensor is
studied using the technique of deconfining and Seiberg's duality. By
construction the gauge group of the dual theory necessarily becomes a product
group. In order to check the duality, several nontrivial consistency conditions
are examined. In particular we find that by deforming along a flat direction,
the duality flows to the Seiberg's duality of SO(N) gauge theory.
