<title>
Overcoming Nonrenormalizability
</title>

<abstract>
  A suitable counterterm for a Euclidean space lattice version of \phi^4_n
theories, n\ge 4, is combined with several additional procedures so that in the
continuum limit the resultant quantum field theory is nontrivial. Arguments to
support this unconventional choice are presented.
