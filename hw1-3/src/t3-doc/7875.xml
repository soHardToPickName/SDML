<title>
The partition function of a 3-dimensional topological scalar-vector
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  A study of the partition function of a 3-dimensional scalar-vector model
formally related via duality to the Rozansky-Witten topological sigma-model is
presented. The partition function is shown to consist of such topological
quantities of a 3-dimensional manifold M like a lattice sum, the
Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion and the Massey product.
