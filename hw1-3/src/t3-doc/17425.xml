World-Volume Potentials on D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  By evaluating string scattering amplitudes, we investigate various low energy
interactions for the massless scalars on a nonabelian Dirichlet brane. We
confirm the existence of couplings of closed string fields to the world-volume
scalars, involving commutators of the latter. Our results are consistent with
the recently proposed nonabelian world-volume actions for Dp-branes.
