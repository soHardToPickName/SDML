Aspects of Confinement and Chiral Dynamics in 2-d QED at Finite
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the Polyakov loop and string tension at zero and finite
temperature in $QED_2.$ Using bozonization the problem is reduced to solving
the Schr\"odinger equation with a particular potential determined by the ground
state. In the presence of two sources of opposite charges the vacuum angle
parameter $\theta $ changes by $2\pi (q/e)$, independent of the number of
flavors. This, in turn, alters the chiral condensate. Particularly, in the one
flavor case through a simple computer algorithm, we explore the chiral dynamics
of a heavy fermion.
