<title>
3-Point Functions in N=4 Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  Three-point functions of analytic (chiral primary) operators in N=4
Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions are calculated using the harmonic
superspace formulation of this theory. In the case of the energy-momentum
tensor multiplet anomaly considerations determine the coefficient. Analyticity
in N=2 harmonic superspace is explicitly checked in a two-loop calculation.
