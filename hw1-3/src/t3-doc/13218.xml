Differential Calculus and Discrete Structures
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a deformation of the ordinary differential calculus which leads from
the continuum to a lattice (and induces a corresponding deformation of physical
theories). We recall some of its features and relate it to a general framework
of differential calculus on discrete sets. This framework generalizes the usual
(lattice) discretization.
