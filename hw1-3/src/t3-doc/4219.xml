<title>
On the Perturbative Equivalence Between the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
  Quantizations
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian (BFV) and Lagrangian (BV) quantization schemes are proved to
be equivalent perturbatively to each other. It is shown in particular that the
quantum master equation being treated perturbatively possesses a local formal
solution.
