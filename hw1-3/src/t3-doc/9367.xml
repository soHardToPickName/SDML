Five-Branes in Heterotic Brane-World Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action for five-dimensional heterotic M-theory in the presence
of five-branes is systematically derived from Horava-Witten theory coupled to
an M5-brane world-volume theory. This leads to a five-dimensional N=1 gauged
supergravity theory on S^1/Z_2 coupled to four-dimensional N=1 theories
residing on the two orbifold fixed planes and an additional bulk three-brane.
We analyse the properties of this action, particularly the four-dimensional
effective theory associated with the domain-wall vacuum state. The moduli
Kahler potential and the gauge-kinetic functions are determined along with the
explicit relations between four-dimensional superfields and five-dimensional
component fields.
