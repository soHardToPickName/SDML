<title>
On the Construction of Zero Energy States in Supersymmetric Matrix
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  For the SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix model related to membranes in 4
space-time dimensions, the general solution to the equation(s)
$Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0$ $(Q\chi =0)$ is determined for N odd. For any such
(bosonic) solution of $Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0$, a (fermionic) $\Phi$ is found that
(formally) satisfies $Q^{\dagger}\Phi=\Psi$.
  For the analogous model in 11 dimensions the solution of $Q^{\dagger}\Psi=0
(Q\Psi=0)$ is outlined.
