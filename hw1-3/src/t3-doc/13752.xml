T-duality and the moment map
</title>

<abstract>
  Aspects of Poisson-Lie T-duality are reviewed in more algebraic way than in
our, rather geometric, previous papers. As a new result, a moment map is
constructed for the Poisson-Lie symmetry of the system consisting of open
strings propagating in a Poisson-Lie group manifold.
