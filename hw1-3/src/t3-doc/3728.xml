<title>
Braid group statistics in two-dimensional quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of algebraic quantum field theory, we construct
explicitly localized morphisms of a Haag-Kastler net in 1+1-dimensional
Minkowski space showing abelian braid group statistics. Moreover, we
investigate the scattering theory of the corresponding quantum fields.
