<title>
Supersymmetry and Dual String Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new classes of string-like soliton solutions in ($N=1$; $D=10$),
($N=2$; $D=6$) and ($N=4$; $D=4$) heterotic string theory. Connections are made
between the solution-generating subgroup of the $T$-duality group of the
compactification and the number of spacetime supersymmetries broken. Analogous
solutions are also noted in ($N=1,2$; $D=4$) compactifications, where a
different form of supersymmetry breaking arises.
