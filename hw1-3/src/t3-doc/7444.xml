Summing Non-Borel Tunneling Amplitudes by Variational Perturbation
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a method for evaluating divergent Borel-nonsummable series by an
analytic continuation of variational perturbation theory. We demonstrate its
validity by an application to the exactly known partition function of the
anharmonic oscillator in zero spacetime dimensions, and derive the full
imaginary part of the ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator for all
negative values of the coupling constant $g$. As a highlight of the theory we
retrieve from the divergent perturbation expansion the instanton action and the
contribution of the higher loop fluctuations around the instanton in the path
integral.
