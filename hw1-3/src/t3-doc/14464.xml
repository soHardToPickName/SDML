Nielsen-Olesen vortices in noncommutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an exact regular vortex solution to the self-dual equations of
the Abelian Higgs model in non-commutative space for arbitrary values of
$\theta$. To this end, we propose an ansatz which is the analogous, in Fock
space, to the one leading to exact solutions for the Nielsen-Olesen vortex in
commutative space. We compute the flux and energy of the solution and discuss
its relevant properties.
