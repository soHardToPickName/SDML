<title>
On the Space-Time Uncertainty Relations of Liouville Strings and D
  Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Within a Liouville approach to non-critical string theory, we argue for a
non-trivial commutation relation between space and time observables, leading to
a non-zero space-time uncertainty relation $\delta x \delta t > 0$, which
vanishes in the limit of weak string coupling.
