<title>
Unitarity, D-brane dynamics and D-brane categories
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short nontechnical note summarizing the motivation and results of
my recent work on D-brane categories. I also give a brief outline of how this
framework can be applied to study the dynamics of topological D-branes and why
this has a bearing on the homological mirror symmetry conjecture. This note can
be read without any knowledge of category theory.
