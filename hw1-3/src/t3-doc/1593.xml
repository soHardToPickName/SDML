Note on Matrix Model with Massless Flavors
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note, following the work of Seiberg in hep-th/0211234 for the
conjecture between the field theory and matrix model in the case with massive
fundamental flavors, we generalize it to the case with massless fundamental
flavors. We show that with a little modifications, the analysis given by
Seiberg can be used directly to the case of massless flavors. Furthermore, this
new method explains the insertion of delta functions in the matrix model given
by Demasure and Janik in hep-th/0211082.
