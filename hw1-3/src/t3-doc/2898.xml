Q-stars and charged q-stars
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the formalism of q-stars with local or global U(1) symmetry. The
equations we formulate are solved numerically and provide the main features of
the soliton star. We study its behavior when the symmetry is local in contrast
to the global case. A general result is that the soliton remains stable and
does not decay into free particles and the electrostatic repulsion preserves it
from gravitational collapse. We also investigate the case of a q-star with
non-minimal energy-momentum tensor and find that the soliton is stable even in
some cases of collapse when the coupling to gravity is absent.
