Depilating Global Charge From Thermal Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  At a formal level, there appears to be no difficulty involved in introducing
a chemical potential for a globally conserved quantum number into the partition
function for space-time including a black hole. Were this possible, however, it
would provide a form of black hole hair, and contradict the idea that global
quantum numbers are violated in black hole evaporation. We demonstrate
dynamical mechanisms that negate the formal procedure, both for topological
charge (Skyrmions) and complex scalar-field charge. Skyrmions collapse to the
horizon; scalar-field charge fluctuates uncontrollably.
