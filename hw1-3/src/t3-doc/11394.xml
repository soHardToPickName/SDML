Reduction of Anyons to One Dimension and Calogero-Sutherland-type Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional anyon system, when reduced to one dimension, yields
models related to the Calogero-Sutherland model. One such reduction leads to a
new model with a class of exact solutions. This model is one of a family of
models obtained upon dimensional reduction of spherically symmetric models in
arbitrary dimensions.
