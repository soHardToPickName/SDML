Equations of motion for N=4 supergravity with antisymmetric tensor from
  its geometric description in central charge superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the geometrical formulation in central charge superspace of the
N=4 supergravity containing an antisymmetric tensor gauge field. The theory is
on-shell, so clearly, the constraints used for the identification of the
multiplet together with the superspace Bianchi identities imply equations of
motion for the component fields. We deduce these equations of motion in terms
of supercovariant quantities and then, we give them in terms of component
fields. These equations of motion, deduced from the geometry, without supposing
the existence of a Lagrangian, are found to be the same as those derived from
the Lagrangian given in the component formulation of this N=4 supergravity
multiplet by Nicolai and Townsend.
