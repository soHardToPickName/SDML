Properties of the Scalar Universal Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The variational properties of the scalar so--called ``Universal'' equations
are reviewed and generalised. In particular, we note that contrary to earlier
claims, each member of the Euler hierarchy may have an explicit field
dependence. The Euler hierarchy itself is given a new interpretation in terms
of the formal complex of variational calculus, and is shown to be related to
the algebra of distinguished symmetries of the first source form.
