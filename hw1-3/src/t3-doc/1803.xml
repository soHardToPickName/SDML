Perturbative Quantum Field Theory at Positive Temperatures: An Axiomatic
  Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the perturbative expansions of the correlation functions of
a relativistic quantum field theory at finite temperature are uniquely
determined by the equations of motion and standard axiomatic requirements,
including the KMS condition. An explicit expression as a sum over generalized
Feynman graphs is derived. The canonical formalism is not used, and the
derivation proceeds from the beginning in the thermodynamic limit. No doubling
of fields is invoked. An unsolved problem concerning existence of these
perturbative expressions is pointed out.
