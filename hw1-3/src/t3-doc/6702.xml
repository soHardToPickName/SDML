Topological quantum field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Following my plenary lecture on ICMP2000 I review my results concerning two
closely related topics: topological quantum field theories and the problem of
quantization of gauge theories. I start with old results (first examples of
topological quantum field theories were constructed in my papers in late
seventies) and I come to some new results, that were not published yet.
