Sewing string tree vertices with ghosts
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to sew string vertices with ghosts at tree level in order to
produce new tree vertices using the Group Theoretic approach to String Theory.
It is then verified the BRST invariance of the sewn vertex and shown that it
has the correct ghost number.
