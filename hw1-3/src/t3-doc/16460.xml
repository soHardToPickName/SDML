<title>
Consistent Off-Shell Tree String Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a construction of off-shell tree bosonic string amplitudes, based on
the operatorial formalism of the $N$-string Vertex, with three external
massless states both for open and closed strings by requiring their being
projective invariant. In particular our prescription leads, in the low-energy
limit, to the three-gluon amplitude in the usual covariant gauge.
