Multiparticle Threshold Amplitudes Exponentiate in Arbitrary Scalar
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Threshold amplitudes are considered for $n$-particle production in arbitrary
scalar theory. It is found that, like in $\phi ^4$, leading-$n$ corrections to
the tree level amplitudes, being summed over all loops, exponentiate. This
result provides more evidence in favor of the conjecture on the exponential
behavior of the multiparticle amplitudes.
