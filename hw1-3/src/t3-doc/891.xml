<title>
Adhering 0-branes to 6-branes and 8-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A Yang-Mills solution is constructed on T^6 which corresponds to a brane
configuration composed purely of 0-branes and 6-branes. This configuration
breaks all supersymmetries and has an energy greater than the sum of the
energies of its components; nonetheless, the configuration is stable
classically, at least to quadratic order. An analogous construction is also
given for a system of 0-branes and 8-branes on T^8. These constructions may
prove to be useful for describing 6-branes and 8-branes in M(atrix) theory.
