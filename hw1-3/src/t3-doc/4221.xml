<title>
Effective Actions and Gauge Field Stability
</title>

<abstract>
  By studying an effective action description of the coupling of charged gauge
fields in $N=2$ $SU(n)$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, we can describe
regions of moduli space where one or more of these fields becomes unphysical.
We discuss subtleties in the structure of the moduli space for $SU(3)$.
