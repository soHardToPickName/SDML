A Space-Time Orbifold: A Toy Model for a Cosmological Singularity
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore bosonic strings and Type II superstrings in the simplest time
dependent backgrounds, namely orbifolds of Minkowski space by time reversal and
some spatial reflections. We show that there are no negative norm physical
excitations. However, the contributions of negative norm virtual states to
quantum loops do not cancel, showing that a ghost-free gauge cannot be chosen.
The spectrum includes a twisted sector, with strings confined to a ``conical''
singularity which is localized in time. Since these localized strings are not
visible to asymptotic observers, interesting issues arise regarding unitarity
of the S-matrix for scattering of propagating states. The partition function of
our model is modular invariant, and for the superstring, the zero momentum
dilaton tadpole vanishes. Many of the issues we study will be generic to
time-dependent cosmological backgrounds with singularities localized in time,
and we derive some general lessons about quantizing strings on such spaces.
