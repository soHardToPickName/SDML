<title>
Intersecting brane geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a survey of the calibrated geometries arising in the study of the
local singularity structure of supersymmetric fivebranes in M-theory. We pay
particular attention to the geometries of 4-planes in eight dimensions, for
which we present some new results as well as many details of the computations.
We also analyse the possible generalised self-dualities which these geometries
can afford.
