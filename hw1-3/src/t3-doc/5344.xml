Integrable Hierarchies and Contact Terms in u-plane Integrals of
  Topologically Twisted Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The $u$-plane integrals of topologically twisted $N = 2$ supersymmetric gauge
theories generally contain contact terms of nonlocal topological observables.
This paper proposes an interpretation of these contact terms from the point of
view of integrable hierarchies and their Whitham deformations. This is inspired
by Mari\~no and Moore's remark that the blowup formula of the $u$-plane
integral contains a piece that can be interpreted as a single-time tau function
of an integrable hierarchy. This single-time tau function can be extended to a
multi-time version without spoiling the modular invariance of the blowup
formula. The multi-time tau function is comprised of a Gaussian factor
$e^{Q(t_1,t_2,...)}$ and a theta function. The time variables $t_n$ play the
role of physical coupling constants of 2-observables $I_n(B)$ carried by the
exceptional divisor $B$. The coefficients $q_{mn}$ of the Gaussian part are
identified to be the contact terms of these 2-observables. This identification
is further examined in the language of Whitham equations. All relevant
quantities are written in the form of derivatives of the prepotential.
