Accelerated Electrons and the Unruh Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum effects for electrons in a storage ring are studied in a co-moving,
accelerated frame. The polarization effect due to spin flip synchrotron
radiation is examined by treating the electron as a simple quantum mechanical
two-level system coupled to the orbital motion and to the radiation field. The
excitations of the spin system are related to the Unruh effect, i.e. the effect
that an accelerated radiation detector is thermally excited by vacuum
fluctuations. The importance of orbital fluctuations is pointed out and the
vertical fluctuations are examined.
