<title>
Calogero-Sutherland model from excitations of Chern-Simons vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a large-N Chern-Simons theory for the attractive bosonic matter
(Jackiw-Pi model) in the Hamiltonian, collective-field approach based on the
1/N expansion. We show that the dynamics of density excitations around the
ground-state semiclassical configuration is governed by the Calogero or by the
Sutherland Hamiltonian, depending on the symmetry of the underlying
static-soliton configuration. The relationship between the Chern-Simons
coupling constant $\l$ and the Calogero-Sutherland statistical parameter $\l_c$
signalizes some sort of statistical transmutation accompanying the dimensional
reduction of the initial problem.
