<title>
A remark on T-duality and quantum volumes of zero-brane moduli spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  T-duality (Fourier-Mukai duality) and properties of classical instanton
moduli spaces can be used to deduce some properties of
$\alpha^{\prime}$-corrected moduli spaces of branes for Type IIA string theory
compactified on $K3$ or $T^4$. Some interesting differences between the two
compactifications are exhibited.
