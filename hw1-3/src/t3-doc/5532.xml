<title>
Anomalies and Renormalization of BFYM Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The (perturbative) renormalization properties of the BF formulation of
Yang-Mills gauge models are shown to be identical to those of the usual, second
order formulation. This result holds in any number of spacetime dimensions and
is a direct consequence of cohomological theorems established by G. Barnich, F.
Brandt and the author (Commun.Math.Phys., 174 (1995) 57).
