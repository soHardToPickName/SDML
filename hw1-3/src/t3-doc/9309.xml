<title>
From Antibracket to Equivariant Characteristic Classes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the odd symplectic structure and the equivariant even
(pre)symplectic one from it on the space of differential forms on the Riemann
manifold. The Poincare -- Cartan like invariants of the second structure define
the equivariant generalizations of the Euler classes on the surfaces.
