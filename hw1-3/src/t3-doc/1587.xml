<title>
A toy model of quantum gravity with a quantized cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral for the hydrogen atom, for example, is formulated as a
one-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields representing the
electron coordinates. The (renormalized) cosmological constant, which
corresponds to the energy eigenvalue, is thus quantized in this model. Possible
implications of the quantized cosmological constant are briefly discussed.
