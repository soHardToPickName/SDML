<title>
On Coarse-grained Entropy and Stimulated Emission in Curved Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the entropy generation and particle production in scalar quantum
field theory in expanding spacetimes with many-particle mixed initial states.
The recently proposed coarse-grained entropy approach by Brandenberger et. al.
is applied to systems which may have a non-zero initial entropy. We find that
although the the particle production is amplified as a result of boson
statistics, the (coarse-grained) entropy generation is {\em attenuated} when
initial particles are present.
