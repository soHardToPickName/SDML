Thermal Wightman Functions and Renormalized Stress Tensors in the
  Rindler Wedge
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wightman functions in the Rindler portion of Minkowski space-time are
presented for any value of the temperature and for massless spin fields up to
s=1 and the renormalized stress tensor relative to Minkowski vacuum is
discussed. A gauge ambiguity in the vector case is pointed out.
