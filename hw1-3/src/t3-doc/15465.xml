Quantum Cosmology and AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the creation of brane-worlds in $AdS$ bulk. We first
consider the simplest case of onebranes in $AdS_3$. In this case we are able to
properly describe the creation of a spherically symmetric brane-world deriving
a general expression for its wavefunction. Then, we sketch the $AdS_{d+1}$
set-up within the context of the WKB approximation. Finally, we comment on
these scenarios in light of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence.
