The Interaction of Two Hopf Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  This Letter deals with topological solitons in an O(3) sigma model in three
space dimensions (with a Skyrme term to stabilize their size). The solitons are
classified topologically by their Hopf number N. The N=2 sector is studied; in
particular, for two solitons far apart, there are three ``attractive
channels''. Viewing the solitons as dipole pairs enables one to predict the
force between them. Relaxing in the attractive channels leads to various static
2-soliton solutions.
