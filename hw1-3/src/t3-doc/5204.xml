Skyrmions from SU(3) harmonic maps and their quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Static properties of SU(3) multiskyrmions with baryon number up to 6
(classical masses and momenta of inertia) are estimated. The calculations are
based on the recently suggested generalization of the SU(2) rational map
ansaetze applied to the SU(3) model. Both SU(2) embedded skyrmions and genuine
SU(3) solutions are considered, and it is shown that although, at the classical
level, the energy of embeddings is lower, the quantum corrections can alter
this conclusion. This correction to the energy of lowest state, bilinear in the
Wess-Zumino (WZ) term, is presented for the most general case as a convolution
of the inverse tensor of inertia and the components of the WZ-term.
