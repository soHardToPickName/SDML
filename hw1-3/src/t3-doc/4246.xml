Symmetry aspects of fermions coupled to torsion and electromagnetic
  fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We study and explore the symmetry properties of fermions coupled to dynamical
torsion and electromagnetic fields. The stability of the theory upon radiative
corrections as well as the presence of anomalies are investigated.
