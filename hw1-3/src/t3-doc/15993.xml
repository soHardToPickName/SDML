<title>
Spectrum of the 2-Flavor Schwinger Model from the Heisenberg Spin Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the strong coupling limit of the 2-flavor lattice Schwinger model in
the Hamiltonian formalism using staggered fermions. We show that the problem of
finding the low-lying states is equivalent to solving the Heisenberg
antiferromagnetic spin chain. We find good agreement with the continuum theory.
