On the Deformation of $\Lambda$-Symmetry in B-field Background
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we will show that the $\Lambda$ symmetry, namely the U(1)
symmetry of the open string sigma model which relates the B-field and the U(1)
gauge field of a brane to each other, is deformed to a noncommutative version
in a constant B-field background.
