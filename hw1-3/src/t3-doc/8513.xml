<title>
Algebraic structure of Gravity with Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRS transformations for gravity with torsion are discussed by using the
Maurer-Cartan horizontality conditions. With the help of an operator $\d$ which
allows to decompose the exterior space-time derivative as a BRS commutator we
solve the Wess-Zumino consistency condition corresponding to invariant
Lagrangians and anomalies.
