<title>
Real Special Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a coordinate-free description of real manifolds occurring in certain
four dimensional supergravity theories with antisymmetric tensor fields. The
relevance of the linear multiplets in the compactification of string and
five-brane theories is also discussed.
