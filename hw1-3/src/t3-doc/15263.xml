Massless N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon: Form Factors approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=1 Super Sinh-Gordon model with spontaneously broken supersymmetry is
considered. Explicit expressions for form-factors of operators e^{\alpha \phi}
of the Neveu-Schwartz sector and operators \sigma e^{\alpha \phi}, \mu
e^{\alpha \phi} of the Ramond sector are proposed.
