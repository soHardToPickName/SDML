On time-dependent AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify aspects of the holographic AdS/CFT correspondence that are typical
of Lorentzian signature, to lay the foundation for a treatment of
time-dependent gravity and conformal field theory phenomena. We provide a
derivation of bulk-to-boundary propagators associated to advanced, retarded and
Feynman bulk propagators, and provide a better understanding of the boundary
conditions satisfied by the bulk fields at the horizon. We interpret the
subleading behavior of the wavefunctions in terms of specific vacuum
expectation values, and compute two-point functions in our framework. We
connect our bulk methods to the closed time path formalism in the boundary
field theory.
