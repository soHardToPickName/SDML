Conformal description of horizon's states
</title>

<abstract>
  The existence of black hole horizon is considered as a boundary condition to
be imposed on the fluctuating metrics. The coordinate invariant form of the
condition for class of spherically symmetric metrics is formulated. The
diffeomorphisms preserving this condition act in (arbitrary small) vicinity of
the horizon and form the group of conformal transformations of two-dimensional
space ($r-t$ sector of the total space-time). The corresponding algebra
recovered at the horizon is one copy of the Virasoro algebra. For general
relativity in $d$ dimensions we find an effective two-dimensional theory
governing the conformal dynamics at the horizon universally for any $d\geq 3$.
The corresponding Virasoro algebra has central charge $c$ proportional to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Identifying the zero-mode configuration we
calculate $L_0$. The counting of states of this horizon's conformal field
theory by means of Cardy's formula is in complete agreement with the
Bekenstein-Hawking expression for the entropy of black hole in $d$ dimensions.
