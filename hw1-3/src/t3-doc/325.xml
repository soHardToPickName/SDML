The Weinberg Propagators
</title>

<abstract>
  An analog of the $j=1/2$ Feynman-Dyson propagator is presented in the
framework of the $j=1$ Weinberg's theory. The basis for this construction is
the concept of the Weinberg field as a system of four field functions differing
by parity and by dual transformations.
