The definition of Neveu-Schwarz superconformal fields and uncharged
  superconformal transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  The construction of Neveu-Schwarz superconformal field theories for any N is
given via a superfield formalism. We also review some results and definitions
of superconformal manifolds and we generalise contour integration and Taylor
expansion to superconformal spaces. For arbitrary N we define (uncharged)
primary fields and give their infinitesimal change under superconformal
transformations. This leads us to the operator product expansion of the
stress-energy tensor with itself and with primary fields. In this way we derive
the well-known commutation relations of the Neveu-Schwarz superconformal
algebras K_N. In this context we observe that the central extension term
disappears for N>=4 for the Neveu-Schwarz theories. Finally, we give the global
transformation rules of primary fields under the action of the algebra
generators.
