Inflation from Tachyon Condensation, Large N Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  Using only general properties of the tachyon potential we show that inflation
may be generic when many branes and anti-branes become coincident. Inflation
may occur because of: (1) the assistance of the many diagonal tachyon fields;
(2) when the tachyons condense in a staggered fashion; or (3) when some of them
condense very late. We point out that such inflation is in some sense a stringy
implementation of chaotic inflation and may have important applications for
``regularizing'' a lopsided or singular cosmological compact surface.
