<title>
A Remark on the Geometry of Two-Dimensional Anisotropic Non-Linear
  Sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  One discusses here the connection between \sigma-model gauge anomalies and
the existence of a connection with torsion that does not flatten the Ricci
tensor of the target manifold, by considering a number of non-symmetric coset
spaces. The influence of an eventual anisotropy on a certain direction of the
target manifold is also contemplated.
