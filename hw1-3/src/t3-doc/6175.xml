Comment on ``New pseudoclassical model for Weyl particles"
</title>

<abstract>
  It is demonstrated that the recently proposed pseudoclassical model for Weyl
particles [1] (D.M. Gitman, A.E. Goncalves and I.V. Tyutin, Phys. Rev. D 50
(1994) 5439) is classically inconsistent. A possible way of removing the
classical inconsistency of the model is proposed.
