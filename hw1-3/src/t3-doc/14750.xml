Strings as a Model for Parent and Baby Universes: Total Splitting Rates
</title>

<abstract>
  Emission of hard microscopic string (graviton) by an excited macroscopic
string may be viewed as a model of branching of a $(1+1)$-dimensional baby
universe off large parent one. We show that, apart from a trivial factor, the
total emission rate is not suppressed by the size of the macroscopic string.
This implies unsuppressed loss of quantum coherence in $(1+1)$-dimensional
parent universe.
