Open String Field Theory around Universal Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the physical spectrum of cubic open string field theory around
universal solutions, which are constructed using the matter Virasoro operators
and the ghost and anti-ghost fields. We find the cohomology of the new BRS
charge around the solutions, which appear with a ghost number that differs from
that of the original theory. Considering the gauge-unfixed string field theory,
we conclude that open string excitations perturbatively disappear after the
condensation of the string field to the solutions.
