<title>
Covariant actions for chiral supersymmetric bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a recently developed covariant Lagrangian formulation for
$p$--forms with (anti)self-dual field-strengths and present its extension to
the supersymmetric case. As explicit examples we construct covariant
Lagrangians for six-dimensional models with N=1 rigid and curved supersymmetry.
