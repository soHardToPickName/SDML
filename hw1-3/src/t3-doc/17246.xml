<title>
An action for the (2,0) self-dual tensor multiplet in a conformal
  supergravity background
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the action for a self-dual tensor in six dimensions, coupled to a
(2,0) conformal supergravity background. This action gives rise to the expected
equations of motion. An alternative look upon one of the gauge symmetries
clarifies its role in the supersymmetry transformation rules and the
realisation of the algebra.
