New Instanton Solutions at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the newly found exact instanton solutions at finite temperature
with a non-trivial Polyakov loop at infinity. They can be described in terms of
monopole constituents and we discuss in this context an old result due to
Taubes how to make out of monopoles non-trivial topological charge
configurations, with possible applications to abelian projection.
