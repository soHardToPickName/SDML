<title>
Towards exact results of QED from supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  To obtain some exact results of U(1) gauge theory (QED), we construct the low
energy effective action of N=2 supersymmetric QED with a massless matter and
Fayet-Iliopoulos term, assuming no confinement. The harmonic superspace
formalism for N=2 extended supersymmetry makes the construction easy. We
analyze the vacuum structure and find no vacuum. It suggests the confinement in
non-supersymmetric QED at low energies.
