Instanton effects and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD2
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry in Quantum
Chromodynamics by considering gluonic instanton configurations in the partition
function. It is shown that in order to obtain nontrivial fermionic correlators
in a two dimensional gauge theory for the strong interactions among quarks, a
regular instanton background has to be taken into account. We work over
massless quarks in the -fundamental- representation of SU(N_c). For large N_c,
massive quarks are also considered.
