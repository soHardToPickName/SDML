2(2S+1)-Component Model and its Connection with Other Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  This talk presents the review of forgotten but attractive formalism proposed
by Joos and Weinberg in the sixties for description of high-spin particles.
Problems raised in the recent works [Ahluwalia {\it et al.}] are discussed. New
results obtained by the author in his preceding papers ["Hadronic J.", 1993, v.
16, No. 5, pp. 423-428; No. 6, pp. 459-467; Preprints IFUNAM FT-93-19, 24, 35]
are reported. In {\it Appendix}, bibliography of publications related with
mentioned $2(2S+1)$- component formalism is presented.
