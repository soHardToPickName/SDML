<title>
Vacuum effects in an asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame with a
  constant magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present article we solve the Dirac-Pauli and Klein Gordon equations in
an asymptotically uniformly accelerated frame when a constant magnetic field is
present. We compute, via the Bogoliubov coefficients, the density of scalar and
spin 1/2 particles created. We discuss the role played by the magnetic field
and the thermal character of the spectrum.
