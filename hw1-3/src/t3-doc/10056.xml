Force in Kappa-Deformed Relativistic Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the physical implications of various choices of the
three-momentum basis in the kappa-deformed Poincare algebra. In particular, we
find that the energy dependence of the velocity of a kappa-particle leads to
unexpected features in kappa-deformed kinematics. We also discuss the notion of
kappa-deformed dynamics, and as a tool example we investigate the motion of a
kappa-deformed particle under the action of a constant force.
