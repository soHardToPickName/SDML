Towards a Gravitational Analog to S-duality in Non-abelian Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  For non-abelian non-supersymmetric gauge theories, generic dual theories have
been constructed. In these theories the couplings appear inverted. However,
they do not possess a Yang-Mills structure but rather are a kind of non-linear
sigma model. It is shown that for a topological gravitational model an analog
to this duality exists.
