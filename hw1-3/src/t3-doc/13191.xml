SUSY Breaking by Overlap of Wave Functions in Coexisting Walls
</title>

<abstract>
  SUSY breaking without messenger fields is proposed. We assume that our world
is on a wall and SUSY is broken only by the coexistence of another wall with
some distance from our wall. The Nambu-Goldstone fermion is localized on the
distant wall. Its overlap with the wave functions of physical fields on our
wall gives the mass splitting of physical fields on our wall thanks to a
low-energy theorem. We propose that this overlap provides a practical method to
evaluate mass splitting in models with SUSY breaking due to the coexisting
walls.
