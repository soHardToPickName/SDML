<title>
Seiberg-Witten Theory and Calogero-Moser Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief account of a series of recent results on twisted and
untwisted elliptic Calogero-Moser systems, and on their fundamental role in the
Seiberg-Witten solution of gauge theories with one massive hypermultiplet in
the adjoint representation of an arbitrary gauge algebra G.
