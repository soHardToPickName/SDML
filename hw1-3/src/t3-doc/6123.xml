<title>
Coset realizations of (super)twistor spaces and structure of
  (super)twistor correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  New types "extended" (super)conformal algebras $G^{(\frac n2)}$ are
presented. (Su\-per)twistor spaces $T$ are subspaces in cosets $G^{(\frac
n2)}/H$. The (super)twistor correspondence has a cleary defined geometrical
meaning.
