T duality for boundary-non-critical strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent work on the action of T duality on Dirichlet-branes is generalized to
the case in which the open string satisfies boundary conditions that are
neither Neumann nor Dirichlet. This is achieved by implementing T duality as a
canonical transformation of the $\sigma$-model path integral. A class of
boundary interactions that violate conformal symmetry is found to be T-dual of
a correspondingly non-conformal class of boundary conditions. The analogy with
some problems in boundary-non-critical quantum mechanics of interest for
condensed matter is pointed out.
