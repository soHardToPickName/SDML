Multiscale N=2 SUSY field theories, integrable systems and their
  stringy/brane origin -- I
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories with the multiple scales in the
brane language. The issue concerns N=2 SUSY gauge theories with massive
fundamental matter including the UV finite case of $n_{f}=2n_c$, theories
involving products of SU(n) gauge groups with bifundamental matter, and the
systems with several parameters similar to $\Lambda_{QCD}$. We argue that the
proper integrable systems are, accordingly, twisted XXX SL(2) spin chain,
$SL(p)$ magnets and degenerations of the spin Calogero system. The issue of
symmetries underlying integrable systems is addressed. Relations with the
monopole systems are specially discussed. Brane pictures behind all these
integrable structures in the IIB and M theory are suggested. We argue that
degrees of freedom in integrable systems are related to KK excitations in M
theory or D-particles in the IIA string theory, which substitute the infinite
number of instantons in the field theory. This implies the presence of more BPS
states in the low-energy sector.
