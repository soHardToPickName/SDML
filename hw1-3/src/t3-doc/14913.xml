Maxwell Chern-Simons Solitons from Type IIB String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study various three-dimensional supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons
solitons by using type IIB brane configurations. We give a systematic
classification of soliton spectra such as topological BPS vortices and
nontopological vortices in $\cn=2,3$ supersymmetric Maxwell Chern-Simons system
via the branes of type IIB string theory. We identify the brane configurations
with the soliton spectra of the field theory and obtain a nice agreement with
field theory aspects. We also discuss possible brane constructions for BPS
domain wall solutions.
