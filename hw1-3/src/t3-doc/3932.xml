<title>
Generalizations of the Dirac Equation and the Modified Bargmann-Wigner
  Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We present various generalizations of the Dirac formalism. The
different-parity solutions of the Weinberg's $2(2J+1)$-component equations are
found. On this basis, generalizations of the Bargmann-Wigner (BW) formalism are
proposed. Relations with modern physics constructs are discussed.
