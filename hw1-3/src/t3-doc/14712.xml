Infinite Quasi-Exactly Solvable Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a new concept of infinite quasi-exactly solvable models which
are constructable through multi-parameter deformations of known exactly
solvable ones. The spectral problem for these models admits exact solutions for
infinitely many eigenstates but not for the whole spectrum. The hermiticity of
their hamiltonians is guaranteed by construction. The proposed models have
quasi-exactly solvable classical conterparts.
