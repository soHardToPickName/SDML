<title>
Charged Topological Solitons in 4+1 Dimensional YMCS Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that when a Chern-Simons term is added to the action of $SU(N)$
($N\geq 3$) Yang-Mills theory in 5 dimensions the usual self-dual topological
solitons present in the theory necessarily pick up a (topological) electric
charge.
