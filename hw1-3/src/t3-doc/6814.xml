Anyons in 1+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of excitations with fractional spin and statististics in
$1+1$ dimensions is explored. The configuration space of a two-particle system
is the half-line. This makes the Hamiltonian self-adjoint for a family of
boundary conditions parametrized by one real number $\gamma$. The limit $\gamma
\rightarrow 0, (\infty$) reproduces the propagator of non-relativistic
particles whose wavefunctions are even (odd) under particle exchange. A
relativistic ansatz is also proposed which reproduces the correct Polyakov spin
factor for the spinning particle in $1+1$ dimensions. These checks support
validity of the interpretation of $\gamma$ as a parameter related to the
``spin'' that interpolates continuously between bosons ($\gamma =0$) and
fermions ($\gamma =\infty$). Our approach can thus be useful for obtaining the
propagator for one-dimensional anyons.
