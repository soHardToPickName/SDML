<title>
New stochastic approach to the renormalization of the supersymmetric
  \phi^4 with ultrametric
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new real space renormalization-group map, on the space of
probabilities, to study the renormalization of the SUSY \phi^4. In our approach
we use the random walk representation on a lattice labeled by an ultrametric
space. Our method can be extended to any \phi^n. New stochastic meaning is
given to the parameters involved in the flow of the map and results are
provided.
