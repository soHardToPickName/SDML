<title>
The quantum anharmonic oscillator in the Heisenberg picture and multiple
  scale techniques
</title>

<abstract>
  Multiple scale techniques are well-known in classical mechanics to give
perturbation series free from resonant terms. When applied to the quantum
anharmonic oscillator, these techniques lead to interesting features concerning
the solution of the Heisenberg equations of motion and the Hamiltonian
spectrum.
