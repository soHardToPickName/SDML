Modular Invariance of Strings on PP-Waves with RR-flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the modular invariance of strings on pp-waves with RR-flux. We
explicitly show that the one-loop partition functions of the maximally
supersymmetric pp-waves and their orbifolds can be modular invariant in spite
of the mass terms in the light-cone gauge. From this viewpoint, we also
determine the spectrum of type 0B theory on pp-wave and discuss its gauge
theory dual. Furthermore, we investigate the spectrum of a non-supersymmetric
orbifold and point out its supersymmetry enhancement in the Penrose limit.
