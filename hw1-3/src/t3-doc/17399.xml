<title>
Fractional spin and the Pauli term
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been claimed that the inclusion of a Pauli term in (2+1)
dimensions gives rise to a new type of anomalous spin term. The form of that
term is shown to contradict the structure relations for the inhomogeneous
Lorentz group.
