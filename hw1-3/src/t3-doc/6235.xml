Harmonic Superspace: New Directions
</title>

<abstract>
  We sketch recent applications of the harmonic superspace approach for
off-shell formulations of $(4,4)$, $2D$ sigma models with torsion and for
constructing super KdV hierarchies associated with "small" and "large" $N=4$
superconformal algebras.
