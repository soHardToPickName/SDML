<title>
The Layer Phase in the Non-isotropic SU(3) Gauge Model at Finite
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The phase structure of a non-isotropic non-Abelian SU(3) lattice gauge model
at finite temperature is investigated to the third order in the
variational-cumulant expansion (VCE) approach. The layer phase exists in this
model in the cases of dimensions D=4, D=5 (d=D-1).
