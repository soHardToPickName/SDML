Fractional Branes and Wrapped Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the ``fractional D-branes'' which arise in orbifold resolution. We
argue that they arise as subsectors of the Coulomb branch of the quiver gauge
theory used to describe both string theory D-brane and Matrix theory on an
orbifold, and thus must form part of the full physical Hilbert space. We make
further observations confirming their interpretation as wrapped membranes.
