<title>
New instantons in the double-well potential
</title>

<abstract>
  A new instanton solution is found in the quantum-mechanical double-well
potential with a four-fermion term. The solution has finite action and depends
on four fermionic collective coordinates. We explain why in general the
instanton action can depend on collective coordinates.
