Soft Supersymmetry Breaking and the Supersymmetric Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We recall how the idea of Softly Broken Supersymmetry led to the construction
of the Supersymmetric Standard Model in 1981. Its first prediction, the
supersymmetric unification of gauge couplings, was conclusively verified by the
LEP and SLC experiments 10 years later. Its other predictions include: the
existence of superparticles at the electroweak scale; a stable lightest
superparticle (LSP) with a mass of $\sim 100$ GeV, anticipated to be a neutral
electroweak gaugino; the universality of scalar and gaugino masses at the
unification scale. The original motivation for the model, solving the hierarchy
problem, indicates that the superparticles should be discovered at the LHC or
the TeVatron.
