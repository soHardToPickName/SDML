<title>
Again on the possible compositeness of the photon
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the transversal and longitudinal 4-vector potentials and
strengths F^{\mu\nu} in the momentum representation on using the second-type
4-spinors recently proposed by Ahluwalia. Questions of relevance of this kind
of theories to the correct photon statistics are briefly discussed.
