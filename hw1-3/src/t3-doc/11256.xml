Vanishing of the Bare Coupling in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine two restructurings of the series relationship between the bare and
renormalized coupling constant in dimensional regularization. In one of these
restructurings, we are able to demonstrate via all-orders summation of leading
and successive epsilon = 0 (dimensionality = 4) poles that the bare coupling
vanishes in the dimension-4 limit.
