<title>
Constrained Quantization of Open String in Background B Field and
  Noncommutative D-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper we provided a consistent quantization of open strings
ending on D-branes with a background $B$ field. In this letter, we show that
the same result can also be obtained using the more traditional method of
Dirac's constrained quantization. We also extend the discussion to the
fermionic sector.
