<title>
The Bosonic Structure of Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We bosonize fermions by identifying their occupation numbers as the binary
digits of a Bose occupation number. Unlike other schemes, our method allows
infinitely many fermionic oscillators to be constructed from just one bosonic
oscillator.
