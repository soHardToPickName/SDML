<title>
Coset conformal field theories with abelian isotropy groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Conformal field theories based on $g/u(1)^d$ coset constructions where $g$ is
a reductive algebra are studied.It is shown that the theories are equivalent to
constrained WZNW models for $g.$ Generators of extended symmetry algebras and
primary fields are constructed.
