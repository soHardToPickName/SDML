Nonlinear Electrodynamics with Singularities (Modernized Born-Infeld
  Electrodynamics)
</title>

<abstract>
  Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics are considered. Main attention is given
to existence of singular point at static field configuration that M.Born and
L.Infeld are considered as a model of electron. It is shown that such
singularities are forbidden within the framework of the Born-Infeld model. It
is proposed a modernized action that make possible an existence of the
singularities. It is obtained main relations in view of the singularities. In
initial approximation this model gives the usual linear electrodynamics with
point charged particles.
