<title>
On the Bosonization of $L$-Operators for Quantum Affine Algebra
  $U_q(sl_2)$
</title>

<abstract>
  Some relations between different objects associated with quantum affine
algebras are reviewed. It is shown that the Frenkel-Jing bosonization of a new
realization of quantum affine algebra $\Uqa$ as well as bosonization of
$L$-operators for this algebra can be obtained from Zamolodchikov-Faddeev
algebras defined by the quantum $R$-matrix satisfying unitarity and
crossing-symmetry conditions. (Talk given at the International Coference
