Spontaneous Magnetization in Maxwell QED$_{2+1}$
</title>

<abstract>
  Spontaneous magnetization in the Maxwell QED$_{2+1}$ at finite fermion
density is studied. It is shown that at low fermion densities the one-loop free
energy has its minimum at some nonvanishing value of the magnetic field. The
magnetization is due to the asymmetry of the fermion spectrum of the massive
QED$_{2+1}$ in an external magnetic field.
