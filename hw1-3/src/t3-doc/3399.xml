Superconformal Mechanics and the Super Virasoro Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=1,2 superconformal mechanics in 0+1 dimensions and show that if
the Hamiltonian is invertible the superconformal generators can be used to
construct half of the super Virasoro algebra. The full algebra can be derived
if the special conformal generator is also invertible. The generators are
quantized and a general prescription is given for the construction of the N=1
algebra independently of the specific details of the superconformal mechanics
provided that in addition its quadratic Casimir operator vanishes.
