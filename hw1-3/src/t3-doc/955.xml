<title>
Zero-Branes, Quantum Mechanics and the Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse some dynamical issues in a modified type IIA supergravity,
recently proposed as an extension of M-theory that admits de Sitter space. In
particular we find that this theory has multiple zero-brane solutions. This
suggests a microscopic quantum mechanical matrix description which yields a
massive deformation of the usual M(atrix) formulation of M-theory and type IIA
string theory.
