Some remarks on the "classical" large N limit
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been proposed some time ago that the large $N-$limit can be understood
as a ``classical limit'', where commutators in some sense approach the
corresponding Poisson brackets. We discuss this in the light of some recent
numerical results for an SU(N) gauge model, which do not agree with this
``classicality'' of the large N-limit. The world sheet becomes very crumpled.
We speculate that this effect would disappear in supersymmetric models.
