<title>
Towards a quantum-mechanical model for multispecies exclusion statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to construct many-particle quantum-mechanical spectra of
particles obeying multispecies exclusion statistics, both in one and in two
dimensions. These spectra are derived from the generalized exclusion principle
and yield the same thermodynamic quantities as deduced from Haldane's
multiplicity formula.
