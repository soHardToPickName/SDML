<title>
Derivative expansion and large gauge invariance at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the 0+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory at finite temperature within
the framework of derivative expansion. We obtain various interesting relations,
solve the theory within this framework and argue that the derivative expansion
is not a suitable formalism for a study of the question of large gauge
invariance.
