An orientifold of the solitonic fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an orientifold of the solitonic fivebrane of type II string theory.
The consideration is restricted to a space-time domain which can be described
by an exact conformal field theory. There are no IR divergent contributions to
tadpole diagrams and thus no consistency conditions arise. However,
extrapolating the results to spatial infinity leads to consistency conditions
implying that there are four (physical) D-6-branes sitting at each of the two
orientifold fixed planes.
