Thermodynamics of Kerr-Newman-AdS Black Holes and Conformal Field
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the thermodynamics of four-dimensional Kerr-Newman-AdS black holes
both in the canonical and the grand-canonical ensemble. The stability
conditions are investigated, and the complete phase diagrams are obtained,
which include the Hawking-Page phase transition in the grand-canonical
ensemble. In the canonical case, one has a first order transition between small
and large black holes, which disappears for sufficiently large electric charge
or angular momentum. This disappearance corresponds to a critical point in the
phase diagram. Via the AdS/CFT conjecture, the obtained phase structure is also
relevant for the corresponding conformal field theory living in a rotating
Einstein universe, in the presence of a global background U(1) current. An
interesting limit arises when the black holes preserve some supersymmetry.
These BPS black holes correspond to highly degenerate zero temperature states
in the dual CFT, which lives in an Einstein universe rotating with the speed of
light.
