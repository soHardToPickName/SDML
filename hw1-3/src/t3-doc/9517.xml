<title>
$g/u(1)^d$ parafermions from constrained WZNW theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The conformal field theory based on the $g/u(1)^d$ coset construction is
treated as the WZNW theory for the affine Lie algebra $\hat g$ with the
constrained $\hat u(1)^d$ subalgebra.Using a modification of the generalized
canonical quantization method generators and primary fields of an extended
symmetry algebra are found for arbitrary d.
