Notes on $WGL_n$-Algebras and Quantum Miura Transformation
</title>

<abstract>
  We start from the quantum Miura transformation [7] for the $W$-algebra
associated with $GL(n)$ group and find an evident formula for quantum
L-operator as well as for the action of $W_l$ currents (l=1,..,n) on elements
of the completely degenerated n-dimensional representation. Quantum formulae
are obtained through the deformation of the pseudodifferential symbols. This
deformation is independent of $n$ and preserves Adler's trace. Our main
instrument of the proof is the notation of pseudodifferential symbol with right
action which has no counterpart in classical theory.
