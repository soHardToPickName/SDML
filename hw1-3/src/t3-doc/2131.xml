<title>
Construction of the effective Poincare algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive expressions for Poincar\'e group generators using preturbative
similarity renormalization group procedure for Hamiltonians. We show that
generators obtained in second-order perturbation theory satisfy required
commutation relations in weak sense, i.e. in matrix elements between states of
finite invariant masses.
