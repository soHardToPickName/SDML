String Interactions in PP-Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that string interactions in a PP-wave spacetime are governed by an
effective coupling $g_{eff}=g_s(\mu p^+\apm)f(\mu p^+ \apm)$ where $f(\mu p^+
\apm)$ is proportional to the light cone energy of the string states involved
in the interaction. This simply follows from generalities of a Matrix String
description of this background. $g_{eff}$ nicely interpolates between the
expected result ($g_s$) for flat space (small $\mu p^+\apm$) and a recently
conjectured expression from the perturbative gauge theory side (large $\mu
p^+\apm$).
