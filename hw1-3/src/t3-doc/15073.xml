Type -B/ -O Bosonic String Sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide world sheet non-supersymmetrical actions that describe the
coupling of a bosonic string to the tachyon and massless states of both the
type-B and type-O theories. The type-B theory is derived as a truncation and
chiral doubling of the Ramond-Ramond sector in our previous model that
connected the (1,0) heterotic string to a 10 D type IIB supergravity
background. The type-O theory then follows from a ``fermionization'' of the
type-B theory.
