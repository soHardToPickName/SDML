<title>
A Topological Model for Two Dimensional Gravity Coupled to Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a topological gauge theory in two dimensions with symmetry
groups $ISO(2,1)$, $SO(2,1)$ and $SO(1,2)$ we construct a model for gravity
with non-trivial coupling to matter. We discuss the equations of motion which
are connected to those of previous related models but incorporate matter
content. We also discuss the resulting quantum theory and finally present
explicit formul\ae $\;$ for topological invariants.
