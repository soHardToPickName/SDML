<title>
2-Dimensional Turbulence: yet another Conformal Field Theory Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  A new conformal field theory description of two-dimensional turbulence is
proposed. The recently established class of rational logarithmic conformal
field theories provides a unique candidate solution which resolves many of the
drawbacks of former approaches via minimal models. This new model automatically
includes magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence and the Alf'ven effect.
