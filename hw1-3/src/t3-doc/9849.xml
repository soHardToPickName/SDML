Stabilized Quantum Gravity: Stochastic Interpretation and Numerical
  Simulation
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the reasoning of Claudson and Halpern, it is shown that
"fifth-time" stabilized quantum gravity is equivalent to Langevin evolution
(i.e. stochastic quantization) between fixed non-singular, but otherwise
arbitrary, initial and final states. The simple restriction to a fixed final
state at $t_5 \rightarrow \infty$ is sufficient to stabilize the theory. This
equivalence fixes the integration measure, and suggests a particular
operator-ordering, for the fifth-time action of quantum gravity. Results of a
numerical simulation of stabilized, latticized Einstein-Cartan theory on some
small lattices are reported. In the range of cosmological constant $\l$
investigated, it is found that: 1) the system is always in the broken phase
$<det(e)> \ne 0$; and 2) the negative free energy is large, possibly singular,
in the vincinity of $\l = 0$. The second finding may be relevant to the
cosmological constant problem.
