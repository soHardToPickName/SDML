<title>
Symmetric products, permutation orbifolds and discrete torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  Symmetric product orbifolds, i.e. permutation orbifolds of the full symmetric
group S_{n} are considered by applying the general techniques of permutation
orbifolds. Generating functions for various quantities, e.g. the torus
partition functions and the Klein-bottle amplitudes are presented, as well as a
simple expression for the discrete torsion coefficients.
