Manifest Duality in Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Born-Infeld theory is formulated using an infinite set of gauge fields, along
the lines of McClain, Wu and Yu. In this formulation electromagnetic duality is
generated by a fully local functional. The resulting consistency problems are
analyzed and the formulation is shown to be consistent.
