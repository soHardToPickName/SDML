<title>
Differential calculus on q-Minkowski space
</title>

<abstract>
  We wish to report here on a recent approach to the non-commutative calculus
on $q$-Minkowski space which is based on the reflection equations with no
spectral parameter. These are considered as the expression of the invariance
(under the coaction of the $q$-Lorentz group) of the commutation properties
which define the different $q$-Minkowski algebras. This approach also allows us
to discuss the possible ambiguities in the definition of $q$-Minkowski space
${\cal M}_q$ and its differential calculus. The commutation relations among the
generators of ${\cal M}_q$ (coordinates), ${\cal D}_q$ (derivatives),
$\Lambda_q$ (one-forms) and a few invariant (scalar) operators are established
and compared with earlier results.
