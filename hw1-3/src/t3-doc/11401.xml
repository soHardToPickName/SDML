U-branes and T^3 fibrations
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe eight-dimensional vacuum configurations with varying moduli
consistent with the U-duality group $SL(2,Z) \times SL(3,Z)$. Focusing on the
latter less-well understood SL(3,Z) properties, we construct a class of
fivebrane solutions living on lines on a three-dimensional base space. The
resulting U-manifolds, with five scalars transforming under SL(3), admit a
Ricci-flat Kahler metric. Based on the connection with special lagrangian $T^3$
fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds, this construction provides a simple framework for
the investigation of Calabi-Yau mirrors.
