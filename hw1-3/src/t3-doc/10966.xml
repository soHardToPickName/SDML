D-Sitter Space: Causal Structure, Thermodynamics, and Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the entropy of concrete de Sitter flux compactifications and
deformations of them containing D-brane domain walls. We determine the relevant
causal and thermodynamic properties of these "D-Sitter" deformations of de
Sitter spacetimes. We find a string scale correspondence point at which the
entropy localized on the D-branes (and measured by probes sent from an observer
in the middle of the bubble) scales the same with large flux quantum numbers as
the entropy of the original de Sitter space, and at which Bousso's bound is
saturated by the D-brane degrees of freedom (up to order one coefficients) for
an infinite range of times. From the geometry of a static patch of D-Sitter
space and from basic relations in flux compactifications, we find support for
the possibility of a low energy open string description of the static patch of
de Sitter space.
