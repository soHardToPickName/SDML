<title>
The dynamical structure of higher dimensional Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Higher dimensional Chern-Simons theories, even though constructed along the
same topological pattern as in 2+1 dimensions, have been shown recently to have
generically a non-vanishing number of degrees of freedom. In this paper, we
carry out the complete Dirac Hamiltonian analysis (separation of first and
second class constraints and calculation of the Dirac bracket) for a group
GxU(1). We also study the algebra of surface charges that arise in the presence
of boundaries and show that it is isomorphic to the WZW4 discussed in the
literature. Some applications are then considered. It is shown, in particular,
that Chern-Simons gravity in dimensions greater than or equal to five has a
propagating torsion.
