Off-Shell Bethe Ansatz Equation for Gaudin Magnets and Solutions of
  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the previously established connection between the off-shell
Bethe ansatz equation for inhomogeneous SU(2) lattice vertex models in the
quasiclassical limit and the solutions of the SU(2) Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov
equations to the case of arbitrary simple Lie algebras.
