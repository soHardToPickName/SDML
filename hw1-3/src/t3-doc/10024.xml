<title>
Orientifold and Type II Dual Pairs
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we present a symmetry of a toroidally compactified type II
string theory. This symmetry has the interpretaion that it interchanges the
left and the right-moving worldsheet coordinates and reverses the orientations
of some of the spatial coordinates. We also identify another discrete symmetry
of the type II theory which is related to the above one by a nontrivial
U-duality element of string theory. This symmetry, however, has trivial action
on the worldsheet coordinates and corresponds to an improper T-duality
rotation. We then construct examples of type II dual pairs in four dimensions
by modding out the known type II dual pairs by the above symmetries. We show
the explicit matching of the spectrum and supersymmetries in these examples.
