<title>
Conformal Maxwell theory as a singleton field theory on AdS_5, IIB
  three-branes and duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the boundary conditions associated with extended supersymmetric
Maxwell theory in 5-dimensional anti-De Sitter space. Excitations on the
boundary are identical to those of ordinary 4-dimensional conformal invariant
super electrodynammics. Extrapolations of these excitations give rise to a
5-dimensional topological gauge theory of the singleton type. The possibility
of a connection of this phenomenon to the world volume theory of 3-branes in
IIB string theory is discussed.
