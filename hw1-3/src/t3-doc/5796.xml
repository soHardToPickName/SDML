Six-dimensional Abelian vortices with quadratic curvature
  self-interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Six-dimensional Nielsen-Olesen vortices are analyzed in the context of a
quadratic gravity theory containing Euler-Gauss-Bonnet self-interactions. The
relations among the string tensions can be tuned in such a way that the
obtained solutions lead to warped compactification on the vortex. New regular
solutions are possible in comparison with the case where the gravity action
only consists of the Einstein-Hilbert term. The parameter space of the model is
discussed
