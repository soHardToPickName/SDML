Brane World Models Without Cosmological Expansive And Darboux
  Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider 5-D gravity plus a bulk scalar field and with parallel 3-branes
in the case when Hubble root is zero. To construct exact solutions we use the
Darboux transformations. To do this we reduce the system of equations which
describes 5-D gravity and bulk scalar field to the Schrodinger equation. The
jump conditions at the branes lead to jump potential in the Schrodinger
equation so we need to modify usual Darboux-Crum formulas in this case. Using
this transformation we have constructed new exact solutions of brane equations
which is some generalization of the Rundall-Sundrum solution.
