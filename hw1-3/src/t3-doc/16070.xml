<title>
Anomaly Inflow on Orientifold Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine some six-dimensional orientifold models with $N = 1$
supersymmetry, which can be realised as intersecting 7-branes and 7-planes.
These models are studied in the light of recent work showing that orientifold
planes carry anomalous gravitational couplings on their world-volume. We show
that gravitational anomalies can be locally cancelled by these new couplings at
every point in the internal space, under the assumption that the anomaly
residing on orientifold planes is distributed in a particular way among
brane-plane and plane-plane intersections.
