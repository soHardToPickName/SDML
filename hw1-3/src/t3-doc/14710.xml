<title>
Quantum Gravity with Minimal Assumptions
</title>

<abstract>
  The purpose is to construct the quantum field theory including gravity, based
on physical assumptions as few as possible. Up to now, the work by Prof. Steven
Weinberg probably suits this purpose the most. Though the purpose is difficult
to reach, my recent preprint was interested in an exceptional case caused by
singularity. Therefore, I'd like to explain the motivations and possible
applications of the preprint.
