On The Interaction Of D0-Brane Bound States And RR Photons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the problem of the interaction between D0-brane bound state and
1-form RR photons by the world-line theory. Based on the fact that in the
world-line theory the RR gauge fields depend on the matrix coordinates of
D0-branes, the gauge fields also appear as matrices in the formulation. At the
classical level, we derive the Lorentz-like equations of motion for D0-branes,
and it is observed that the center-of-mass is colourless with respect to the
SU(N) sector of the background. Using the path integral method, the
perturbation theory for the interaction between the bound state and the RR
background is developed. We discuss what kind of field theory may be
corresponded to the amplitudes which are calculated by the perturbation
expansion in world-line theory. Qualitative considerations show that the
possibility of existence of a map between the world-line theory and the
non-Abelian gauge theory is very considerable.
