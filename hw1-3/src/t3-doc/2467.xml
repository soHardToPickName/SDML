<title>
Straight-line string with curvature
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical and quantum solutions for the relativistic straight-line string
with arbitrary dependence on the world surface curvature are obtained. They
differ from the case of the usual Nambu-Goto interaction by the behaviour of
the Regge trajectory which in general can be nonlinear. Regularization of the
action is considered and comparison with relativistic point with curvature is
made.
