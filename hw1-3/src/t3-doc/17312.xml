Diff-invariant Kinetic Terms in Arbitrary Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the physical content of quadratic diff-invariant Lagrangians in
arbitrary dimensions by using covariant symplectic techniques. This paper
extends previous results in dimension four. We discuss the difference between
the even and odd dimensional cases.
