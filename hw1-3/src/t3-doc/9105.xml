Polchinski ERG Equation in O(N) Scalar Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the Polchinski ERG equation for d-dimensional O(N) scalar
field theory. In the context of the non-perturbative derivative expansion we
find families of regular solutions and establish their relation with the
physical fixed points of the theory. Special emphasis is given to the large N
limit for which many properties can be studied analytically.
