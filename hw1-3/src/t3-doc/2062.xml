<title>
On a possible quantum limit for the stabilization of moduli in
  brane-world scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  I consider the implications for brane-world scenarios of the rather robust
quantum-gravity expectation that there should be a quantum minimum limit on the
uncertainty of all physical length scales. In order to illustrate the possible
significance of this issue, I observe that, according to a plausible estimate,
the quantum limit on the length scales that characterize the bulk geometry
could affect severely the phenomenology of a recently-proposed brane-world
scenario.
