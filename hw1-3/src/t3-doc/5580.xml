Five-branes in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a construction of five-branes which fill both light-cone
dimensions in Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind's matrix model of M theory.
We argue that they have the correct long-range fields and spectrum of
excitations. We prove Dirac charge quantization with the membrane by showing
that the five-brane induces a Berry phase in the membrane world-volume theory,
with a familiar magnetic monopole form.
