On free massless (pseudo)scalar quantum field theory in 1+1-dimensional
  space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a consistent quantum field theory of a free massless
(pseudo)scalar field in 1+1-dimensional space-times free of infrared
divergences. We show that a continuous symmetry of (pseudo)scalar field
translations is spontaneously broken. Goldstone bosons appear as quanta of a
free massless (pseudo)scalar field. We show that the main inequality between
vacuum expectation values of certain operators which has been used for the
derivation of the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem is fulfilled in the quantum
field theory of a free massless (pseudo)scalar field free of infrared
divergences.
