SO(2,1) Covariant IIB Superalgebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a type IIB super-Poincare algebra with SO(2,1) covariant central
extension. Together with SO(2,1) and SO(9,1) generators, a SO(2,1) triplet
(momenta), a Majorana-spinor doublet (supercharges) and a Rarita-Schwinger
central charge generate a group, G. We consider a coset G/H where H=(SO(2) x
Lorentz), and the SL(2,R) 2-form doublet is obtained by the coset construction.
It is shown that U(1) connections, whose strengths are associated with 2-forms,
are recognized as coordinates of the enlarged space. We suggest that this is
the fundamental algebra governing the superstring theories which explains the
IIB SL(2,R) duality and geometrical origin of U(1) fields.
