<title>
Heating Field Theory the ``Environmentally Friendly'' Way!
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss how to implement an ``environmentally friendly'' renormalization
in the context of finite temperature field theory. Environmentally friendly
renormalization provides a method for interpolating between the different
effective field theories which characterize different asymptotic regimes. We
give explicit two loop Pad\'e resummed results for $\l\ff$ theory for $T>T_c$.
We examine the implications for non-Abelian gauge theories.
