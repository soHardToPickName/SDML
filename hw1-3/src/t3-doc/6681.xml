Vector Positronium States in QED3
</title>

<abstract>
  The homogeneous Bethe-Salpeter equation is solved in the quenched ladder
approximation for the vector positronium states of 4-component quantum
electrodynamics in 2 space and 1 time dimensions. Fermion propagator input is
from a Rainbow approximation Dyson-Schwinger solution, with a broad range of
fermion masses considered. This work is an extension of earlier work on the
scalar spectrum of the same model. The non-relativistic limit is also
considered via the large fermion mass limit. Classification of states via their
transformation properties under discrete parity transformations allows
analogies to be drawn with the meson spectrum of QCD.
