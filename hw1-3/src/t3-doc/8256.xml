Symmetries of Large N Matrix Models for Closed Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the symmetry algebra of multi-matrix models in the planar large N
limit. We use this algebra to associate these matrix models with quantum spin
chains. In particular, certain multi-matrix models are exactly solved by using
known results of solvable spin chain systems.
