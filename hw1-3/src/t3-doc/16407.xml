S-duality for 2-d gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the analogue of S-duality for 2-d gravity. Our analysis is
based in a partition function associated to the Katanaev-Volovich type action
for 2-d gravity. We find a S-dual 2-d gravitational action which is related to
the original 2-d gravitational action by strong-weak duality transformation.
