<title>
Nonrelativistic Quantum Particle in a Curved Space as a Constrained
  System
</title>

<abstract>
  The operator and the functional formulations of the dynamics of constrained
systems are explored for determining unambiguously the quantum Hamiltonian of a
nonrelativistic particle in a curved space.
