<title>
The Effective Prepotential of N=2 Supersymmetric SO(N_c) and Sp(N_c)
  Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the effective prepotentials for N=2 supersymmetric SO(N_c) and
Sp(N_c) gauge theories, with an arbitrary number of hypermultiplets in the
defining representation, from restrictions of the prepotentials for suitable
N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories with unitary gauge groups. (This extends
previous work in which the prepotential for N=2 supersymmetric SU(N_c) gauge
theories was evaluated from the exact solution constructed out of spectral
curves.) The prepotentials have to all orders the logarithmic singularities of
the one-loop perturbative corrections, as expected from non-renormalization
theorems. We evaluate explicitly the contributions of one- and two-instanton
processes.
