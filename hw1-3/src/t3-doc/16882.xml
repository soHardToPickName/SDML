From Big Bang to Big Crunch and Beyond
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a quotient Conformal Field Theory, which describes a 3+1 dimensional
cosmological spacetime. Part of this spacetime is the Nappi-Witten (NW)
universe, which starts at a ``big bang'' singularity, expands and then
contracts to a ``big crunch'' singularity at a finite time. The gauged WZW
model contains a number of copies of the NW spacetime, with each copy connected
to the preceeding one and to the next one at the respective big bang/big crunch
singularities. The sequence of NW spacetimes is further connected at the
singularities to a series of non-compact static regions with closed timelike
curves. These regions contain boundaries, on which the observables of the
theory live. This suggests a holographic interpretation of the physics.
