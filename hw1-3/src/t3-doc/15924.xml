Geometrical Aspects of Fivebranes in Heterotic/F-Theory Duality in Four
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the method of stable degenerations to study the local geometry of
Calabi-Yau fourfolds for F-theory compactifications dual to heterotic
compactifications on a Calabi-Yau threefold with fivebranes wrapping
holomorphic curves in the threefold. When fivebranes wrap intersecting curves,
or when many fivebranes wrap the same curve, the dual fourfolds degenerate in
interesting ways. We find that some of these can be usefully described in terms
of degenerations of the base of the elliptic fibrations of these fourfolds. We
use Witten's criterion to determine which of the fivebranes can lead to the
generation of a non-perturbative superpotential.
