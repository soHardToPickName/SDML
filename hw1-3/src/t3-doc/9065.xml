<title>
Measurements, errors, and negative kinetic energy
</title>

<abstract>
  An analysis of errors in measurement yields new insight into the penetration
of quantum particles into classically forbidden regions. In addition to
``physical" values, realistic measurements yield ``unphysical" values which, we
show, can form a consistent pattern. An experiment to isolate a particle in a
classically forbidden region obtains negative values for its kinetic energy.
These values realize the concept of a {\it weak value}, discussed in previous
works.
