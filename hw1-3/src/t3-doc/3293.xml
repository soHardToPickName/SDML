RG Flows from Super-Liouville Theory to Critical Ising Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an integrable deformation of the super-Liouville theory which
generates a RG flows to the critical Ising model as the IR fixed point. This
model turns out to be a supersymmetric sinh-Gordon model with spontaneously
broken N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting massless Goldstino is the only stable
on-shell particle which controls the IR behaviours. We propose the exact
$S$-matrix of the Goldstino and compare associated thermodynamic Bethe ansatz
equations with the quantization conditions derived from the reflection
amplitudes of the the super-Liouville theory to provide nonperturbative checks
for both the (NS) and the (R) sectors.
