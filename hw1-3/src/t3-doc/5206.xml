<title>
Supersymmetric domain wall x G/H solutions of IIB supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  1-brane nonmaximally supersymmetric solutions of D=10 chiral supergravity are
discussed. In the dual frame, their near brane geometry is the product of a
3-dimensional domain wall spacetime and a 7-dimensional homogeneous Einstein
space G/H.
