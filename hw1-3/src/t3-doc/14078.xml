Star products and perturbative quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the application of the deformation quantization approach to
perturbative quantum field theory. We show that the various forms of Wick's
theorem are a direct consequence of the structure of the star products. We
derive the scattering function for a free scalar field in interaction with a
spacetime-dependent source. We show that the translation to operator formalism
reproduces the known relations which lead to the derivation of the Feynman
rules.
