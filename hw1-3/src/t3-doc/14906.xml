The m->0 limit for massive graviton in dS_4 and AdS_4. How to circumvent
  the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, by considering physics in dS_4 or AdS_4 spacetime, one can
circumvent the van Dam - Veltman - Zakharov theorem which requires that the
extra polarization states of a massive graviton do not decouple in the massless
limit. It is shown that the smoothness of the m->0 limit is ensured if the H
(``Hubble'') parameter, associated with the horizon of the dS_4 or AdS_4 space,
tends to zero slower than the mass of the graviton m.
