Thermal radiation in non-static curved spacetimes: quantum mechanical
  path integrals and configuration space topology
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantum mechanical path integral derivation is given of a thermal
propagator in non-static Gui spacetime. The thermal nature of the propagator is
understood in terms of homotopically non-trivial paths in the configuration
space appropriate to tortoise coordinates. The connection to thermal emission
from collapsing black holes is discussed.
