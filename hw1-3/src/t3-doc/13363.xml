<title>
Derived Categories and Zero-Brane Stability
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a particular class of topological field theories associated to open
strings and prove the resulting D-branes and open strings form the bounded
derived category of coherent sheaves. This derivation is a variant of some
ideas proposed recently by Douglas. We then argue that any 0-brane on any
Calabi-Yau threefold must become unstable along some path in the Kahler moduli
space. As a byproduct of this analysis we see how the derived category can be
invariant under a birational transformation between Calabi-Yaus.
