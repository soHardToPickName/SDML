<title>
Covariant symplectic structure of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation admits covariant bi-symplectic structure
for complex dimension 3, or higher. The first symplectic 2-form is obtained
from a new variational formulation of complex Monge- Amp\`ere equation in the
framework of the covariant Witten-Zuckerman approach to symplectic structure.
We base our considerations on a reformulation of the Witten-Zuckerman theory in
terms of holomorphic differential forms. The first closed and conserved
Witten-Zuckerman symplectic 2-form for the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation is
obtained in arbitrary dimension and for all cases elliptic, hyperbolic and
homogeneous.
   The connection of the complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Ricci-flat
K\"ahler geometry suggests the use of the Hilbert action. However, we point out
that Hilbert's Lagrangian is a divergence for K\"ahler metrics. Nevertheless,
using the surface terms in the Hilbert Lagrangian we obtain the second
Witten-Zuckerman symplectic 2-form for complex dimension>2.
