<title>
Pauli-Villars Regularization of Globally Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the one-loop ultraviolet divergences in renormalizable
supersymmetric theories can be regulated by the introduction of heavy
Pauli-Villars chiral supermultiplets, provided the generators of the gauge
group are traceless in the matter representation. The procedure is extended to
include supersymmetric gauged nonlinear sigma models.
