<title>
Schild Action and Space-Time Uncertainty Principle in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the path-integral quantization of relativistic strings with the
Schild action is essentially equivalent to the usual Polyakov quantization at
critical space-time dimensions. We then present an interpretation of the Schild
action which points towards a derivation of superstring theory as a theory of
quantized space-time where the squared string scale plays the role of the
minimum quantum for space-time areas. A tentative approach towards such a goal
is proposed, based on a microcanonical formulation of large N supersymmetric
matrix model.
