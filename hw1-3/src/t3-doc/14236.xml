Quasi-Particles in Non-Commutative Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  After a short introduction to the UV/IR mixing in non-commutative field
theories we review the properties of scalar quasi-particles in non-commutative
supersymmetric gauge theories at finite temperature. In particular we discuss
the appearance of super-luminous wave propagation.
