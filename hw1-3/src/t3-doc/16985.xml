General Solution of the WZNW System and 2D Induced Gravity in Curved
  Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the general solution of the equations of motion for the WZNW system
in curved space-time for arbitrary external gauge fields. Using the connection
between the WZNW system for $SL(2,R)$ group and 2D induced gravity we obtain
the general solution of the equations of motion for 2D induced gravity in
curved space-time from that of the WZNW system. We independently presented the
direct solution of 2D induced gravity equations of motion and obtain the same
result.
