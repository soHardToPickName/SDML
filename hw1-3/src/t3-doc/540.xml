<title>
Infrared singularities in the renormalization group flow of Yang-Mills
  theories in the axial gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, by explicit calculation in the axial gauge, that the
renormalization group flow for the Wilson loop in perturbation theory does
exhibit singularities and consequently it can not eventually reproduce the
gauge invariant result, when the infrared cut off is removed
