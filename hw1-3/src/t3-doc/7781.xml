Auxiliary representations of Lie algebras and the BRST constructions
</title>

<abstract>
  The method of construction of auxiliary representations for a given Lie
algebra is discussed in the framework of the BRST approach. The corresponding
BRST charge turns out to be non -- hermitian. This problem is solved by the
introduction of the additional kernel operator in the definition of the scalar
product in the Fock space. The existence of the kernel operator is proven for
any Lie algebra.
