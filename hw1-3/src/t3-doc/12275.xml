<title>
Perturbative approach to the two-dimensional quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The main part of this presentation is a review of the previous original works
on the perturbative covariant approach to the $2$-dimensional quantum gravity.
We discuss the renormalization of the two-dimensional dilaton gravity in a
harmonic gauge, the form of the quantum corrections to the classical potential,
and the conditions of Weyl invariance in a theory of string coupled to $2d$
quantum gravity.
