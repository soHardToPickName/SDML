<title>
On Simulating Liouvillian Flow From Quantum Mechanics Via Wigner
  Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  The interconnection between quantum mechanics and probabilistic classical
mechanics for a free relativistic particle is derived in terms of Wigner
functions (WF) for both Dirac and Klein-Gordon (K-G) equations. Construction of
WF is achieved by first defining a bilocal 4-current and then taking its
Fourier transform w.r.t. the relative 4-coordinate. The K-G and Proca cases
also lend themselves to a closely parallel treatment provided the Kemmer-
Duffin beta-matrix formalism is employed for the former. Calculation of WF is
carried out in a Lorentz-covariant fashion by standard `trace' techniques. The
results are compared with a recent derivation due to Bosanac.
