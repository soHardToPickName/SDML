<title>
Harmonic Superspaces For Three-Dimensional Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Three-dimensional field theories with N=3 and N=4 supersymmetries are
considered in the framework of the harmonic-superspace approach. Analytic
superspaces of these supersymmetries are similar; however, the geometry of
gauge theories with the manifest N=3 is richer and admits construction of the
topological mass term.
