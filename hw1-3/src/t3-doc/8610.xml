On the Path Integral in Imaginary Lobachevsky Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral on the single-sheeted hyperboloid, i.e.\ in $D$-dimensional
imaginary Lobachevsky space, is evaluated. A potential problem which we call
``Kepler-problem'', and the case of a constant magnetic field are also
discussed.
