2D Quantum Gravity and The Miura Map
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the sL(3,C) mKDV string theories. We obtain the flows and the string
equations. Using the generalized Miura map, we show that we have an unification
of these models with the [P,Q]=Q sL(3,C) KDV ones in the framework of
open-closed string theories in minimal models backgrounds.
