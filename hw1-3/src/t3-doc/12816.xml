Absorption of dilaton partial waves by D3-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the leading term in the low-energy absorption cross section for
an arbitrary partial wave of the dilaton field by a stack of many coincident
D3-branes. We find that it precisely reproduces the semiclassical absorption
cross section of a 3-brane geometry, including all numerical factors. The
crucial ingredient in making the correspondence is the identification of the
precise operators on the D3-brane world-volume which couple to the dilaton
field and all its derivatives. The needed operators are related through
T-duality and the IIA/M-theory correspondence to the recently determined
M(atrix) theory expressions for multipole moments of the 11D supercurrent.
These operators have a characteristic symmetrized trace structure which plays a
key combinatorial role in the analysis for the higher partial waves. The
results presented here give new evidence for an infinite family of
non-renormalization theorems which are believed to exist for two-point
functions in ${\cal N} = 4$ gauge theory in four dimensions.
