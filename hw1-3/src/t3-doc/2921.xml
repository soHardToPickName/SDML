Quantum Rings and Recursion Relations in 2D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  I study tachyon condensate perturbations to the action of the two dimensional
string theory corresponding to the c=1 matrix model. These are shown to deform
the action of the ground ring on the tachyon modules, confirming a conjecture
of Witten. The ground ring structure is used to derive recursion relations
which relate (N+1) and N tachyon bulk scattering amplitudes. These recursion
relations allow one to compute all bulk amplitudes.
