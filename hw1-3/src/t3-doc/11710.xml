<title>
Causality and Self-consistency in Classical Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a pedagogical review of old inconsistencies of Classical
Electrodynamics and of some new ideas that solve them. Problems with the
electron equation of motion and with the non-integrable singularity of its
self-field energy tensor are well known. They are consequences, we show, of
neglecting terms that are null off the charge world-line but that give a non
null contribution on its world-line. The electron self-field energy tensor is
integrable without the use of any kind of renormalization; there is no
causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in the electron
equation of motion, when its meaning is properly considered.
