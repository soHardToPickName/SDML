Quantum Field Theory in the Limit x << 1
</title>

<abstract>
  The asymptotic high momentum behaviour of quantum field theories with cubic
interactions is investigated using renormalization group techniques in the
asymmetric limit x << 1. Particular emphasis is paid to theories with
interactions involving more than one field where it is found that a matrix
renormalization is necessary. Asymptotic scaling forms, in agreement with Regge
theory, are derived for the elastic two-particle scattering amplitude and
verified in one-loop renormalization group improved perturbation theory,
corresponding to the summation of leading logs to all orders. We give explicit
forms for the Regge trajectories of different scalar theories in this
approximation and determine the signatures.
