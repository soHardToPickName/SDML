Electrostatic self-energy in QED_2 on curved background
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering the vacuum polarization, we study the effects of geometry on
electrostatic self--energy of a test charge near the black hole horizon and
also in regions with strong and weak curvature in static two dimensional curved
backgrounds. We also discuss the relation of ultraviolet behavior of the gauge
field propagator and charge confinement.
