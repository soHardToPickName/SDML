Geometrical Construction of Type I Superstring Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  The parameter-space orbifold construction of open and unoriented toroidal and
(target-space) orbifold compactifications is briefly reviewed, with emphasis on
the underlying geometrical framework. A class of chiral four-dimensional type-I
vacua with three generations is also discussed.
