<title>
Divergences in Kaluza-Klein Models and their String Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  Effective field theories with (large) extra dimensions are studied within a
physical regularization scheme provided by string theory. Explicit string
calculations then allow us to consistently analyze the ultraviolet sensitivity
of Kaluza--Klein theories in the presence or absence of low energy
supersymmetry.
