<title>
On the Uniqueness of the Non-Abelian Gauge Theories in Epstein-Glaser
  Approach to Renormalisation Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalise a result of Aste and Scharf saying that, under some reasonable
assumptions, consistent with renormalisation theory, the non-Abelian gauge
theories describes the only possibility of coupling the gluons. The proof is
done using Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalisation theory.
