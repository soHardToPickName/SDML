<title>
On the Schild action for D=0 and D=1 strings
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the integration measure over the matrix $Y$ in the matrix
representation of the Schild action can be fixed by comparing the Schild matrix
model with the random lattice string model for D=0. It is further checked that
the given measure is consistent with the case D=1 as well.
