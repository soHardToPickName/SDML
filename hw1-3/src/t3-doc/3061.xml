Partition Functions, Intertwiners and the Coxeter Element
</title>

<abstract>
  The partition functions of Pasquier models on the cylinder, and the
associated intertwiners, are considered. It is shown that earlier results due
to Saleur and Bauer can be rephrased in a geometrical way, reminiscent of
formulae found in certain purely elastic scattering theories. This establishes
the positivity of these intertwiners in a general way and elucidates
connections between these objects and the finite subgroups of SU(2). It also
offers the hope that analogous geometrical structures might lie behind the
so-far mysterious results found by Di Francesco and Zuber in their search for
generalisations of these models.
