Quantum Corrections to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr-Newman
  Metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  We use effective field theory techniques to examine the quantum corrections
to the gravitational metrics of charged particles, with and without spin. In
momentum space the masslessness of the photon implies the presence of
nonanalytic pieces $\sim \sqrt{-q^2},q^2\log -q^2$ etc. in the form factors of
the energy-momentum tensor. We show how the former reproduces the classical
non-linear terms of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m and Kerr-Newman metrics while
the latter can be interpreted as quantum corrections to these metrics, of order
$G\alpha\hbar/mr^3$
