<title>
Old-fashioned dualities revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  In the lectures given at '96 Kashikojima Summer Institute, Amagi-Highland
Seminars, and Yukawa Institute Workshop, the old-fashioned dualities and the
theory of extended objects are reviewed, starting from 't Hooft-Mandelstam
duality and following the author's old works. Application of the old-fashioned
dualities to new issues are also given on the D-branes, on the phase transition
of B-F theory to Einstein gravity and on the swimming of microorganisms.
