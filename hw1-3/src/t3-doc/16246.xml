Dirac Electron in the Electric Dipole Field
</title>

<abstract>
Dirac equation for the finite dipole potential is solved by the method of the
join of the asymptotics. The formulas for the near continuum state energy term
of a relativistic electron-dipole system are obtained analytically. Two cases
are considered: $Z < 137$ and $Z >137$
