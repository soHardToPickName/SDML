New $AdS_3$ Branes and Boundary States
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine D-branes on $AdS_3$, and find a three-brane wrapping the entire
$AdS_3$, in addition to 1-branes and instantonic 2-branes previously discussed
in the literature. The three-brane is found using a construction of Maldacena,
Moore, and Seiberg. We show that all these branes satisfy Cardy's condition and
extract the open string spectrum on them.
