A note on path integrals and time evolutions in BRST quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent formal solutions of BRST quantization on inner product spaces within
the operator method are shown to lead to an unexpected interpretation of the
conventional path integral formulation. The relation between the Hamiltonians
in the two formulations is nontrivial. For the operator method the
correspondence requires certain quantum rules which make the formal solutions
exact, and for the path integral the correspondence yields a precise connection
between boundary conditions and the choice of gauge fixing.
