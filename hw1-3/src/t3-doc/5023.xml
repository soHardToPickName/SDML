<title>
The String Calculation of QCD Wilson Loops on Arbitrary Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Compact string expressions are found for non-intersecting Wilson loops in
SU(N) Yang-Mills theory on any surface (orientable or nonorientable) as a
weighted sum over covers of the surface. All terms from the coupled chiral
sectors of the 1/N expansion of the Wilson loop expectation values are
included.
