<title>
Perturbative analysis of an n-Ising model on a random surface
</title>

<abstract>
  Two dimensional quantum gravity coupled to a conformally invariant matter
field of central charge c=n/2, is represented, in a discretized version, by n
independent Ising spins per cell of the triangulations of a random surface. The
matrix integral representation of this model leads to a diagrammatic expansion
at large orders, when the Ising coupling constant is tuned to criticality, one
extracts the values of the string susceptibility exponent. We extend our
previous calculation to order eight for genus zero and investigate now also the
genus one case in order to check the possibility of having a well-defined
double scaling limit even c>1.
