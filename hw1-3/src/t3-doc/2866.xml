Thick branes and Gauss-Bonnet self-interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Thick branes obtained from a bulk action containing Gauss-Bonnet
self-interactions are analyzed in light of the localization properties of the
various modes of the geometry. The entangled system describing the localization
of the tensor, vector and scalar fluctuation is decoupled in terms of variables
invariant for infinitesimal coordinate transformations. The dynamics of the
various zero modes is discussed and solved in general terms. Provided the
four-dimensional Planck mass is finite and provided the geometry is everywhere
regular, it is shown that the vector and scalar zero modes are not localized.
The tensor zero mode is localized leading to four-dimensional gravity. The
general formalism is illustrated through specific analytical examples
