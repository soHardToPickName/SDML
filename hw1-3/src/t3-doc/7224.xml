Collective-Field Excitations in the Calogero Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the large-N Calogero model in the \h\ collective-field approach
based on the $1/N$ expansion. The Bogomol'nyi limit appears and the
corresponding equation for the semiclassical configuration gives the correct
ground-state energy. Using the method of the orthogonal polynomial we find the
excitation spectrum of density fluctuations around the semiclassical solution
for any value of the statistical parametar $\l$. The wave functions of the
excited states are explicitly constructed as a product of Hermite polynomials
in terms of the collective modes.The two-point correlation function is
calculated as a series expansion in $1/\rho$ for any intermediate statistics.
