<title>
The measure in three dimensional Nambu-Goto string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the measure of the three dimensional Nambu-Goto string theory
has a simple decomposition as a measure on two parameter group of induced
area-preserving transformations of the immersed surface and a trivial measure
for the area of the surface.
