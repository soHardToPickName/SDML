On New Forms of the BRST Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to derive systematically new forms of the BRST transformations
for a generic gauge fixed action. They arise after a symmetry of the gauge
fixed action is found in the sector involving the Lagrange multiplier and its
canonical momentum.
