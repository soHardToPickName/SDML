Thermal Monopoles

<abstract>
  Evidence is given that some particles with large charges in gauge theories,
including 4d N=4 SU(3) and 5d theories with N=1 supersymmetry, have macroscopic
entropy. The ground state entropy is found to be extensive in the charges. The
mass gap for excitation is estimated and is of the same order as the binding
energy. The question of the decay of excited states through Hawking radiation
is raised. The analysis is based on the model of (p,q) string webs and on
various other results. The evidence points to an explanation in terms of a
string model.
