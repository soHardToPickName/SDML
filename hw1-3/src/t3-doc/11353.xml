<title>
Macroscopic and Microscopic (Non-)Universality of Compact Support Random
  Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A random matrix model with a sigma-model like constraint, the restricted
trace ensemble (RTE), is solved in the large-n limit. In the macroscopic limit
the smooth connected two-point resolvent G(z,w) is found to be non-universal,
extending previous results from monomial to arbitrary polynomial potentials.
Using loop equation techniques we give a closed though non-universal expression
for G(z,w), which extends recursively to all higher k-point resolvents. These
findings are in contrast to the usual unconstrained one-matrix model. However,
in the microscopic large-n limit, which probes only correlations at distance of
the mean level spacing, we are able to show that the constraint does not modify
the universal sine-law. In the case of monomial potentials $V(M)=M^{2p}$, we
provide a relation valid for finite-n between the k-point correlation function
of the RTE and the unconstrained model. In the microscopic large-n limit they
coincide which proves the microscopic universality of RTEs.
