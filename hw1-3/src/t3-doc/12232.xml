<title>
Emission from parallel p-brane Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The entropy of a near-extremal black hole made of parallel D-branes has been
shown to agree, upto a numerical factor, with that of the gas of massless open
string states on the brane worldvolume when the string coupling is chosen
suitably. We investigate the process of emission or absorption of massless
S-wave neutral scalars by these black holes. We show that with rather mild
assumptions about the nature of the interactions between the scalar and open
string states, the D-brane cross-section generally fails to reproduce the
universal low energy black hole cross-section except for 1-branes and 3-branes.
