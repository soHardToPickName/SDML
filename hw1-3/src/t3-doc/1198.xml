Dirac Monopole in Non-Commutative Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider static U(1) monopole in non-commutative space. Up to the second
order in the non-commutativity scale $\theta$, we find no non-trivial
corrections to the Dirac solution, the monopole mass remains infinite. We argue
the same holds for any arbitrary higher order. Some speculation about the
nature of non-commutative spacetime and its relation to the cosmological
constant is made.
