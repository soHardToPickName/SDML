The Generalized Moyal Nahm and Continuous Moyal Toda Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We present in detail a class of solutions to the $4D SU(\infty)$ Moyal Anti
Self Dual Yang Mills equations that are related to $reductions$ of the
generalized Moyal Nahm quations using the Ivanova-Popov ansatz. The former
yields solutions to the ASDYM/SDYM equations for arbitary gauge groups. A
further dimensional reduction yields solutions to the Moyal Anti Self Dual
Gravitational equations. The Self Dual Yang Mills /Self Dual Gravity case
requires a separate study. SU(2) and $SU(\infty)$ (continuous) Moyal Toda
equations are derived and solutions to the latter equations in $implicit$ form
are proposed via the Lax-Brockett double commutator formalism . An explicit map
taking the Moyal heavenly form (after a rotational Killing symmetry reduction)
into the SU(2) Moyal Toda field is found. Finally, the generalized Moyal Nahm
equations are conjectured that contain the continuous $SU(\infty)$ Moyal Toda
equation after a suitable reduction. Three different embeddings of the three
different types of Moyal Toda equations into the Moyal Nahm equations are
discussed.
