Fusion algebra and Verlinde's formula
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the coefficients of decomposition into an irreducible components
of the tensor powers of level $r$ symmetric algebra of adjoint representation
coincide with the Verlinder numbers. Also we construct (for $sl(2)) the
representations of a general linear group those dimensions are given by
corresponding Verlinde's numbers.
