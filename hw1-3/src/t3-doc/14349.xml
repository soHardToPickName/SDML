Conformal Blocks of Coset Construction: Zero Ghost Number
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that zero ghost conformal blocks of coset theory G/H are
determined uniquely by those of G and H theories. G/G theories are considered
as an example, their structure constants and correlation functions on sphere
are calculated.
