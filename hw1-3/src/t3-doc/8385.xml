Entropy of Non-Extreme Rotating Black Holes in String Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the Rindler space description of rotating black holes in string
theories. We argue that the comoving frame is the natural frame for studying
thermodynamics of rotating black holes and statistical analysis of rotating
black holes gets simplified in this frame. We also calculate statistical
entropies of general class of rotating black holes in heterotic strings on tori
by applying D-brane description and the correspondence principle. We find at
least qualitative agreement between the Bekenstein-Hawking entropies and the
statistical entropies of these black hole solutions.
