<title>
Radiatively-Induced Lorentz and CPT Violating Chern-Simons Term in QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the induced Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons term arising
from the Lorentz- and CPT-violating sector of quantum electrodynamics with a
$b_\mu\bar{\psi}\gamma^\mu\gamma_5\psi$ term. The result to all orders in $b$
coincides with the previous linear-in-$b$ calulation by Chung and Oh
[hep-th/9812132] as well as Jackiw and Kosteleck\'{y} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf
82}, 3572 (1999)], since all higher order terms vanish.
