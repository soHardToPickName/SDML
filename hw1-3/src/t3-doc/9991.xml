Comment on covariant duality symmetric actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that an action proposed by A. Khoudeir and N. R. Pantoja in
{\sl Phys. Rev.} {\bf D53}, 5974 (1996) for endowing Maxwell theory with
manifest electric--magnetic duality symmetry contains, besides the Maxwell
field, additional propagating vector degrees of freedom. Hence it cannot be
considered as a duality symmetric action for a {\it single} abelian gauge
field.
