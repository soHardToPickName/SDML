The Bisognano-Wichmann Theorem for Massive Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The geometric action of modular groups for wedge regions (Bisognano-Wichmann
property) is derived from the principles of local quantum physics for a large
class of Poincare covariant models in d=4. As a consequence, the CPT theorem
holds for this class. The models must have a complete interpretation in terms
of massive particles. The corresponding charges need not be localizable in
compact regions: The most general case is admitted, namely localization in
spacelike cones.
