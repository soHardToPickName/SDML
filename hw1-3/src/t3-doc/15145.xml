<title>
On Solvable Lattice Models and Knot Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, a class of solvable interaction round the face lattice models (IRF)
were constructed for an arbitrary rational conformal field theory (RCFT) and an
arbitrary field in it. The Boltzmann weights of the lattice models are related
in the extreme ultra violet limit to the braiding matrices of the rational
conformal field theory. In this note we use these new lattice models to
construct a link invariant for any such pair of an RCFT and a field in it.
Using the properties of RCFT and the IRF lattice models, we prove that the
invariants so constructed always obey the Markov properties, and thus are true
link invariants. Further, all the known link invariants, such as the Jones,
HOMFLY and Kauffman polynomials arise in this way, along with giving a host of
new invariants, and thus also a unified approach to link polynomials. It is
speculated that all link invariants arise from some RCFT, and thus the problem
of classifying link and knot invariants is equivalent to that of classifying
two dimensional conformal field theory.
