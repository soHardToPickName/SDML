How to construct a coordinate representation of a Hamiltonian operator
  on a torus
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamical system of a point particle constrained on a torus is quantized
\`a la Dirac with two kinds of coordinate systems respectively; the Cartesian
and toric coordinate systems. In the Cartesian coordinate system, it is
difficult to express momentum operators in coordinate representation owing to
the complication in structure of the commutation relations between canonical
variables. In the toric coordinate system, the commutation relations have a
simple form and their solutions in coordinate representation are easily
obtained with, furthermore, two quantum Hamiltonians turning up. A problem
comes out when the coordinate system is transformed, after quantization, from
the Cartesian to the toric coordinate system.
