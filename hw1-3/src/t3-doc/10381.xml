Entropy and topology for manifolds with boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work a deep relation between topology and thermodynamical features of
manifolds with boundaries is shown. The expression for the Euler
characteristic, through the Gauss- Bonnet integral, and the one for the entropy
of gravitational instantons are proposed in a form which makes the relation
between them self-evident. A generalization of Bekenstein-Hawking formula, in
which entropy and Euler characteristic are related in the form $S=\chi A/8$, is
obtained. This formula reproduces the correct result for extreme black hole,
where the Bekenstein-Hawking one fails ($S=0$ but $A \neq 0$). In such a way it
recovers a unified picture for the black hole entropy law. Moreover, it is
proved that such a relation can be generalized to a wide class of manifolds
with boundaries which are described by spherically symmetric metrics (e.g.
Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m, static de Sitter).
