<title>
Encoding the scaling of the cosmological variables with the Euler Beta
  function
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the scaling exponents for the expanding isotropic flat cosmological
models. The dimension of space, the equation of state of the cosmic fluid and
the scaling exponent for a physical variable are related by the Euler Beta
function that controls the singular behavior of the global integrals. We
encounter dual cosmological scenarios using the properties of the Beta
function. For the entropy density integral we reproduce the Fischler-Susskind
holographic bound.
