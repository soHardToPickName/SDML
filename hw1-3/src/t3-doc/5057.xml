<title>
Brane World in a Topological Black Hole Bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a static brane in the background of a topological black hole, in
arbitrary dimensions. For hyperbolic horizons, we find a solution only when the
black hole mass assumes its minimum negative value. In this case, the tension
of the brane vanishes, and the brane position coincides with the location of
the horizon. For an elliptic horizon, we show that the massless mode of
Randall-Sundrum is recovered in the limit of large black hole mass.
