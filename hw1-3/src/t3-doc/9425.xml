String-Based Methods in Perturbative Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory implies a relatively modest growth in computational complexity
for perturbative gravity calculations as compared to gauge theory calculations,
contrary to field theory expectations. An explicit string-based calculation,
which would be extremely difficult using conventional techniques, is presented
to illustrate this.
