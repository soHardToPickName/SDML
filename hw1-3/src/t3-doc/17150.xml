Non-BPS Branes on a Calabi-Yau Threefold and Bose-Fermi Degeneracy
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the spectrum of open strings for non-BPS D-brane configuration in
type II string theory on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In general, there is no
degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states. However we find special values
for the moduli space of Calabi-Yau threefolds there are non-BPS brane
configurations which have an exact degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic
states. For these values there is no force between pairs of non-BPS D-branes.
This gives rise to a possibility of building diverse non-supersymmetric gauge
field theories on the brane world-volume. We use the approach recently
elaborated by Gaberdiel and Sen.
