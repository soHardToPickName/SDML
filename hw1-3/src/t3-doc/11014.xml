Exact Wavefunction in a Noncommutative Dipole Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The nonrelativistic case of noncommutative scalar dipole field theory with
quartic interaction on a two-dimensional spacetime is analyzed. As there are
two parameters in the general quartic interaction we try a way to find their
relation. To do this we first investigate the formulation of the quantum
mechanics for a particle carrying the noncommutative dipole. We point out a
problem therein and propose a possible method to solve it. We use this
prescription to determined the quartic interaction term in the field theory
once the noncommutative dipole is turned on. The two particle Schr\"odinger
equation is then solved and the exact wavefunction of the bound state and
associated spectrum are found. It is seen that the wavefunction has three
center positions in the relative coordinates and the separation of the center
is equal to the dipole length $L$ of the dipole field, exhibiting the nature of
the noncommutative dipole field.
