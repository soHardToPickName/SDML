Adelic Path Integrals for Quadratic Lagrangians
</title>

<abstract>
  Feynman's path integral in adelic quantum mechanics is considered. The
propagator K(x'',t'';x',t') for one-dimensional adelic systems with quadratic
Lagrangians is analytically evaluated. Obtained exact general formula has the
form which is invariant under interchange of the number fields R and Q_p.
