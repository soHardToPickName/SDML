<title>
Superfield Formalism of Stochastic Quantization Method with
  Field-Dependent Kernels
</title>

<abstract>
  I consider a Langevin equation with field-dependent kernels and investigate
supersymmetry of the stochastic generating functional constructed from the
Langevin equation. Moreover I describe the stochastic generating functional in
terms of a superfield. In the superfield formalism, it becomes clear that the
stochastic quantization method with the field-dependent kernel is equivalent to
the path-integral quantization method.
