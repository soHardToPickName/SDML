A Note on Marginally Stable Bound States in Type II String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Spectrum of elementary string states in type II string theory contains
ultra-short multiplets that are marginally stable. $U$-duality transformation
converts these states into bound states at threshold of $p$-branes carrying
Ramond-Ramond charges, and wrapped around $p$-cycles of a torus. We propose a
test for the existence of these marginally stable bound states. Using the
recent results of Polchinski and of Witten, we argue that the spectrum of bound
states of $p$-branes is in agreement with the prediction of $U$-duality.
