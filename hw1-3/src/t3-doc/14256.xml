Mass and Gauge Invariance IV (Holography for the Karch-Randall Model)
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the Karch-Randall compactification is holographically dual to a
4-d conformal field theory coupled to gravity on Anti de Sitter space. Using
this interpretation we recover the mass spectrum of the model. In particular,
we find no massless spin-2 states. By giving a purely 4-d interpretation to the
compactification we make clear that it represents the first example of a local
4-d field theory in which general covariance does not imply the existence of a
massless graviton. We also discuss some variations of the Karch-Randall model
discussed in the literature, and we examine whether its properties are generic
to all conformal field theory.
