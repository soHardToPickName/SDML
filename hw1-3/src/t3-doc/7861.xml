<title>
Path-integral quantization of $W_\infty$ gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the anomalies of $W_\infty$ gravity in the context of
path-integralquantization. We derive the ghost-loop anomalies to all orders in
$\hbar$ directly from the path-integral measure by the Fujikawa method. We also
show that in the matter sector the higher-loop anomalies can be obtained by
implementation of the Wess-Zumino consistency condition using the one-loop
anomaly. Cancellation of the anomalies between these two sectors then leaves
the theory anomaly-free.
