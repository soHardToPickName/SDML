Renormalization Group Fixed Points and Connections with Duality in
  Various Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some recent results concerning gauge theories in various
dimensions. In particular, we discuss RG fixed points and ``mirror'' symmetry
duality in 3d N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories and a classification of
non-trivial RG fixed points in 5d N=1 supersymmetric theories.
