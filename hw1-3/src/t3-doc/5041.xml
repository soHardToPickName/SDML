<title>
The non-local action for the induced 2d supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional simple supergravity is reexamined from the point of view
of super-Weyl group cohomologies. The non-local form of the effective action of
2d supergravity which generalise the famous $R 1/\Box R$ is obtained.
