On Aspects and Implications of the New Covariant 4D, N = 1 Green-Schwarz
  Sigma-model Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Utilizing (2,0) superfields, we write a supersymmetry-squared action and
partially relate it to the new formulation of the Green-Schwarz action given by
Berkovits and Siegel. Recent results derived from this new formulation are
discussed within the context of some prior proposals in the literature. Among
these, we note that 4D, N = 1 beta-FFC superspace geometry with a composite
connection for R-symmetry has now been confirmed as the only presently known
limit of 4D, N = 1 heterotic string theory that is derivable in a completely
rigorous manner.
