Gaugino Determinant in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We resolve an ambiguity in the sign of the gaugino determinant in
supersymmetric models. The result, that the gaugino determinant can be taken
positive for all background gauge configurations, is necessary for application
of QCD inequalities and lattice Monte Carlo methods to supersymmetric
Yang-Mills models.
