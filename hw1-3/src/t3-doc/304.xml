Boosting some type--D metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  We are presenting a general solution to the classical
Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton--axion equations starting from a metric of type--D.
Namely, this stringy solution is the result of a transformation on a general
vacuum type--D solution to the Einstein's equations which was studied in detail
some years ago.
