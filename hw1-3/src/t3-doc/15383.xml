<title>
On off-shell bosonic string amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a simple prescription for computing, in the framework of the bosonic
string theory, off-shell one-loop amplitudes with any number of external
massless particles, both for the open and for the closed string. We discuss
their properties and, in particular, for the two-string one-loop amplitudes we
show their being transverse.
