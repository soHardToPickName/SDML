Symplectic Quantization of Open Strings and Noncommutativity in Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to translate boundary conditions into constraints in the
symplectic quantization method by an appropriate choice of generalized
variables. This way the symplectic quantization of an open string attached to a
brane in the presence of an antisymmetric background field reproduces the non
commutativity of the brane coordinates.
