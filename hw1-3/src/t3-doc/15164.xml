<title>
Putting String/Fivebrane Duality to the Test
</title>

<abstract>
  According to string/fivebrane duality, the Green-Schwarz factorization of the
$D=10$ spacetime anomaly polynomial $I_{12}$ into $X_4\, X_8$ means that just
as $X_4$ is the anomaly polynomial of the $d=2$ string worldsheet so $X_8$
should be the anomaly polynomial of the $d=6$ fivebrane worldvolume. To test
this idea we perform a fivebrane calculation of $X_8$ and find perfect
agreement with the string one--loop result.
