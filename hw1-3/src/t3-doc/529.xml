Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz with Haldane Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equation for the situation inwhich
the statistical interaction of a multi-particle system is governed by Haldane
statistics. We formulate a macroscopical equivalence principle for such
systems. Particular CDD-ambiguities play a distinguished role in compensating
the ambiguity in the exclusion statistics. We derive Y-systems related to
generalized statistics. We discuss several fermionic, bosonic and anyonic
versions of affine Toda field theories and Calogero-Sutherland type models in
the context of generalized statistics.
