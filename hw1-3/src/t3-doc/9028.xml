Magnetic solutions to 2+1 dimensional gravity with dilaton field
</title>

<abstract>
  We show a general method to solve 2+1 dimensional dilatonic Maxwell-Einstein
equation with a positive or negative cosmological constant. All the physical
solutions are listed with assumptions that they are static, rotationally
symmetric, and has a nonzero magnetic field and a nonzero dilaton field. On the
contrary to the magnetic solution without a dilaton field, some of the present
solutions with a dilaton field possess a horizon.
