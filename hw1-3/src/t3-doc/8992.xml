<title>
Conserved charges in the chiral 3-state Potts model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the perturbations of the 3-state Potts conformal field theory
introduced by Cardy as a description of the chiral 3-state Potts model. By
generalising Zamolodchikov's counting argument and by explicit calculation we
find new inhomogeneous conserved currents for this theory. We conjecture the
existence of an infinite set of conserved currents of this form and discuss
their relevance to the description of the chiral Potts models.
