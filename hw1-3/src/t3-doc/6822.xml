<title>
Symmetries and the Antibracket
</title>

<abstract>
  Requiring that a Lagrangian path integral leads to certain identities (Ward
identities in a broad sense) can be formulated in a general BRST language, if
necessary by the use of collective fields. The condition of BRST symmetry can
then be expressed with the help of the antibracket, and suitable
generalizations thereof. In particular, a new Grassmann-odd bracket, which
reduces to the conventional antibracket in a special limit, naturally appears.
We illustrate the formalism with various examples.
