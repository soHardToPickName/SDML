Quantum symmetries in discrete gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the fusion, braiding and scattering properties of discrete
non-abelian anyons. These occur in (2+1)-dimensional theories where a gauge
group G is spontaneously broken down to some discrete subgroup H. We identify
the quantumnumbers of the electrically and magnetically charged sectors of the
remaining discrete gauge theory, and show that on the quantum level the
symmetry group H is extended to the (quasi-triangular) Hopf algebra D(H). Most
of our considerations are relevant for discrete gauge theories in
(3+1)-dimensional space time as well.
