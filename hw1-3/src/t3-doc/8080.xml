Penrose Limits of the Baryonic D5-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  The Penrose limits of a D5-brane wrapped on the sphere of AdS_5 x S^5 and
connected to the boundary by M fundamental strings, which is dual to the baryon
vertex of the N=4 SU(M) super Yang-Mills theory, are investigated. It is shown
that, for null geodesics that lead to the maximally supersymmetric Hpp-wave
background, the resulting D5-brane is a 1/2-supersymmetric null brane. For an
appropriate choice of radial geodesic, however, the limiting configuration is
1/4-supersymmetric and closely related to the Penrose limit of a flat space
BIon.
