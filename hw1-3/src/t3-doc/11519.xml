<title>
Non-Uniqueness of Quantized Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quantized Yang-Mills theories in the framework of causal
perturbation theory which goes back to Epstein and Glaser. In this approach
gauge invariance is expressed by a simple commutator relation for the S-matrix.
The most general coupling which is gauge invariant in first order contains a
two-parametric ambiguity in the ghost sector - a divergence- and a
coboundary-coupling may be added. We prove (not completely) that the higher
orders with these two additional couplings are gauge invariant, too. Moreover
we show that the ambiguities of the n-point distributions restricted to the
physical subspace are only a sum of divergences (in the sense of vector
analysis). It turns out that the theory without divergence- and
coboundary-coupling is the most simple one in a quite technical sense. The
proofs for the n-point distributions containing coboundary-couplings are given
up to third or fourth order only, whereas the statements about the
divergence-coupling are proven in all orders.
