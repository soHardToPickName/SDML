<title>
Field Correlators in the Georgi-Glashow Model and Several Aspects of its
  String Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  String representations of the Wilson loop and of the non-Abelian analog of
the 't Hooft loop, defined on the string world-sheet, are studied in the
Londons' limit of the 4D Georgi-Glashow model. In the first case, massive gauge
bosons yield only perimeter type terms, whereas in the second case, they also
interact with the string, which enables one to derive the coefficient functions
parametrizing the bilocal correlator of the dual field strength tensors. The
asymptotic behaviours of these functions at small and large distances are
argued to be in a good agreement with the observable lattice data.
