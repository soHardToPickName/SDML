Solitons in (1,1)-supersymmetric massive sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the solitons of massive (1,1)-supersymmetric sigma models with target
space the groups $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$ for a class of scalar potentials and
compute their charge, mass and moduli space metric. We also investigate the
massive sigma models with target space any semisimple Lie group and show that
some of their solitons can be obtained from embedding the $SO(2)$ and $SU(2)$
solitons.
