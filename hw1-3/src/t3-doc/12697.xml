<title>
Massless integrable quantum field theories and massless scattering in
  1+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  These lecture notes provide an elementary introduction to the study of
massless integrable quantum field theory in 1+1 dimensions using ``massless
scattering''. Some previously unpublished results are also presented, including
a non-perturbative study of Virasoro conserved quantities.
