<title>
A practical gauge invariant regularization of the SO(10) grand unified
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a simple modification of the dimensional regularization
allows to compute in a consistent and gauge invariant way any diagram with less
than four loops in the SO(10) unified model. The method applies also to the
Standard Model generated by the symmetry breaking $SO(10) \to SU(3)\times
SU(2)\times U(1)$. A gauge invariant regularization for arbitrary diagram is
also described.
