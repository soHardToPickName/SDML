<title>
Generalized parity transformations in the regularized Chern-Simons
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study renormalization effects in the Abelian Chern-Simons (CS) action.
These effects can be non-trivial when the gauge field is coupled to dynamical
matter, since the regularization of the UV divergences in the model forces the
introduction of a parity even piece in the gauge field action. This changes the
classical (odd) transformation properties of the pure CS action. This effect,
already discussed for the case of a lattice regularization by F. Berruto, M.C.
Diamantini and P. Sodano in hep-th/0004203, is also present when the theory is
defined in the continuum and, indeed, it is a manifestation of a more general
`anomalous' effect, since it happens for every regularization scheme. We
explore the physical consequences of this anomaly. We also show that
generalized, nonlocal parity transformations can be defined in such a way that
the regularized theory is odd, and that those transformations tend to the usual
ones when the cutoff is removed. These generalized transformations play a role
that is tantamount to the deformed symmetry corresponding to Ginsparg-Wilson
fermions [2] (in an even number of spacetime dimensions).
