<title>
A Possible Black Hole Background in c=1 Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new space-time interpretation for c=1 matrix model with
potential $V(x)=-x^{2}/2-\m^{2}/2x^{2}$. It is argued that this particular
potential corresponds to a black hole background. Some related issues are
discussed.
