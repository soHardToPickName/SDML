<title>
An open bosonic string with one end fixed
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a bosonic string with one end free and the other confined to a
D-brane. Only the odd oscillator modes are allowed, which leads to a Virasoro
algebra of even Virasoro modes only. The theory is quantized in a gauge where
world-sheet time and ordinary time are identified. There are no negative or
null norm states, and no tachyon. The Regge slope is twice that of the open
string; this can serve as a test of the usefulness of the the model as a
semi-quantitative description of mesons with one light and one extremely heavy
quark when such higher spin mesons are found. The Virasoro conditions select
specific SO(D-1) irreps. The asymptotic density of states can be estimated by
adapting the Hardy-Ramanujan analysis to a partition of odd integers; the
estimate becomes exact as D goes to infinity.
