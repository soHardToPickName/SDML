Areal Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  New features are described for models with multi-particle area-dependent
potentials, in any number of dimensions. The corresponding many-body field
theories are investigated for classical configurations. Some explicit solutions
are given, and some conjectures are made about chaos in such field theories.
