Free q-Deformed Relativistic Wave Equations by Representation Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In a representation theoretic approach a free q-relativistic wave equation
must be such, that the space of solutions is an irreducible representation of
the q-Poincare algebra. It is shown how this requirement uniquely determines
the q-wave equations. As examples, the q-Dirac equation (including q-gamma
matrices which satisfy a q-Clifford algebra), the q-Weyl equations, and the
q-Maxwell equations are computed explicitly.
