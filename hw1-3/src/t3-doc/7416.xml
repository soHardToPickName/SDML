Massive Spin 3/2 Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the general non-minimally coupled charged massive spin 3/2 model
both for its low energy phenomenological properties and for its unitarity,
causality and degrees of freedom behaviour. When the model is viewed as an
effective theory, its parameters (after ensuring the correct excitation count)
are related to physical characteristics, such as the magnetic moment g factor,
by means of low energy theorems. We also provide the corresponding higher spin
generalisation. Separately, we consider both low and high energy unitarity, as
well as the causality aspects of our models. None (including truncated N=2
supergravity) is free of the minimal model's acausality.
