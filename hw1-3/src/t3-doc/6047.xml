<title>
"Peireles Substitution" and Chern-Simons Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  An elementary derivation is given for the ``Peierles substitution'' used in
projecting dynamics in a strong magnetic field onto the lowest Landau level.
The projection of wavefunctions and the ordering prescription for the projected
Hamiltonian is explained.
