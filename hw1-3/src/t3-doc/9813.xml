<title>
Wilsonian effective action for SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with
  Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov decomposition
</title>

<abstract>
  The Cho-Faddeev-Niemi-Shabanov decomposition of the SU(2) Yang-Mills field is
employed for the calculation of the corresponding Wilsonian effective action to
one-loop order with covariant gauge fixing. The generation of a mass scale is
observed, and the flow of the marginal couplings is studied. Our results
indicate that higher-derivative terms of the color-unit-vector $\mathbf{n}$
field are necessary for the description of topologically stable knotlike
solitons which have been conjectured to be the large-distance degrees of
freedom.
