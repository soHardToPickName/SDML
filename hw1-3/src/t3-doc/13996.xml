<title>
Covariantising the Beltrami equation in W-gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, certain higher dimensional complex manifolds were obtained in
[hep-th/9412078] by associating a higher dimensional uniformisation to the
generalised Teichm\"uller spaces of Hitchin. The extra dimensions are provided
by the ``times'' of the generalised KdV hierarchy. In this paper, we complete
the proof that these manifolds provide the analog of superspace for W-gravity
and that W-symmetry linearises on these spaces. This is done by explicitly
constructing the relationship between the Beltrami differentials which
naturally occur in the higher dimensional manifolds and the Beltrami
differentials which occur in W-gravity. This also resolves an old puzzle
regarding the relationship between KdV flows and W-diffeomorphisms.
