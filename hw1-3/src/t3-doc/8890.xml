Odd-flavored QCD_3 and Random Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider QCD_3 with an odd number of flavors in the mesoscopic scaling
region where the field theory finite-volume partition function is equivalent to
a random matrix theory partition function. We argue that the theory is parity
invariant at the classical level if an odd number of masses are zero. By
introducing so-called pseudo-orthogonal polynomials we are able to relate the
kernel to the kernel of the chiral unitary ensemble in the sector of
topological charge $\nu={1/2}$. We prove universality and are able to write the
kernel in the microscopic limit in terms of field theory finite-volume
partition functions.
