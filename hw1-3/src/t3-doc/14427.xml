Causal Propagators for Algebraic Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  Applying the principle of analytic extension for generalized functions we
derive causal propagators for algebraic non-covariant gauges. The so generated
manifestly causal gluon propagator in the light-cone gauge is used to evaluate
two one-loop Feynman integrals which appear in the computation of the
three-gluon vertex correction. The result is in agreement with that obtained
through the usual prescriptions.
