Non-Singularity of the Exact Two-Dimensional String Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the global structure of the exact two-dimensional space-time which
emerges from string theory. Previous work has shown that in the semi-classical
limit, this is a black hole similar to the Schwarzschild solution. However, we
find that in the exact case, a new Euclidean region appears "between" the
singularity and black hole interior. However the boundary between the
Lorentzian and Euclidean regions is a coordinate singularity, which turns out
to be a surface of time reflection symmetry in an extended space-time. Thus
strings having fallen through the black hole horizon would eventually emerge
through another one into a new asymptotically flat region. The maximally
extended space-time consists of an infinite number of universes connected by
wormholes. There are no singularities present in this geometry. We also
calculate the mass and temperature associated with the space-time.
