Topological chiral symmetry breaking in SUSY NJL in curved space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective potential in the model introduced by
Buchbinder-Inagaki-Odintsov (BIO) which represents SUSY NJL model non-minimally
coupled with the external gravitational field is found. The topology of the
space is considered to be non-trivial. Chiral symmetry breaking under the
action of external curvature and non-trivial topology is investigated.
