Non-BPS States in Heterotic - Type IIA Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between some perturbative non-BPS states of the heterotic theory
on T^4 and non-perturbative non-BPS states of the orbifold limit of type IIA on
K3 is exhibited. The relevant states include a non-BPS D-string, and a non-BPS
bound state of BPS D-particles (`D-molecule'). The domains of stability of
these states in the two theories are determined and compared.
