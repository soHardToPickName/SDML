Orbifold Resolution by D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study topological properties of the D-brane resolution of
three-dimensional orbifold singularities, C^3/Gamma, for finite abelian groups
Gamma. The D-brane vacuum moduli space is shown to fill out the background
spacetime with Fayet--Iliopoulos parameters controlling the size of the
blow-ups. This D-brane vacuum moduli space can be classically described by a
gauged linear sigma model, which is shown to be non-generic in a manner that
projects out non-geometric regions in its phase diagram, as anticipated from a
number of perspectives.
