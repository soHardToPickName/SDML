Correlators of currents corresponding to the massive $p$-form fields in
  AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  By solving the equations of motion of massive $p$-form potential in
Anti-de-Sitter space and using the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence of Maldacena, the
generating functional of two-point correlation functions of the currents is
obtained. When the mass parameter vanishes the result agrees with the known
massless case.
