Grand Unification with Three Generations in Free Fermionic String Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the problem of constructing three generation free fermionic string
models with grand unified gauge groups. We attempt the construction of $G\times
G$ models, where $G$ is a grand unified group realized at level 1. This
structure allows those Higgs representations to appear which are necessary to
break the symmetry down to the standard model gauge group. For $G=SO(10)$, we
find only models with an even number of generations. However, for $G=SU(5)$ we
find a number of 3 generation models.
