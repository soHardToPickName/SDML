<title>
Cosmological Theories From $SO(2,2)/SO(2)\times SO(1,1)$
</title>

<abstract>
  We herein set forth intrinsically four-dimensional string solutions and
analyze some of its properties. The solutions are constructed as gauged WZW
models of the coset $SO(2,2)/SO(2)\times SO(1,1)$. We recover backgrounds
having metric and antisymmetric tensors, dilaton fields and two electromagnetic
fields. The theories describe anisotropically expanding and static universes
for some time values.
