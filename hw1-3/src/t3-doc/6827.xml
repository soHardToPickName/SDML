On Adelic Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  New approach to p-adic and adelic strings, which takes into account that not
only world sheet but also Minkowski space-time and string momenta can be p-adic
and adelic, is formulated. p-Adic and adelic string amplitudes are considered
within Feynman's path integral formalism. The adelic Veneziano amplitude is
calculated. Some discreteness of string momenta is obtained. Also, adelic
coupling constant is equal to unity.
