Symmetry Properties of the Effective Action for High-Energy Scattering
  in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effective action describing high-energy scattering processes in
the multi-Regge limit of QCD, which should provide the starting point for a new
attempt to overcome the limitations of the leading logarithmic and the eikonal
approximations. The action can be obtained via simple graphical rules or by
integrating in the QCD functional integral over momentum modes of gluon and
quark fields that do not appear explicitely as scattering or exchanged
particles in the considered processes. The supersymmetry is used to obtain the
terms in the action involving quarks fields from the pure gluonic ones. We
observe a Weizs\"acker - Williams type relations between terms describing
scattering and production of particles.
