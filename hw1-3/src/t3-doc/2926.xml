<title>
The Relation between the Mandelstam and the Cayley-Hamilton Identities
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the characteristic polynomial for ordinary matrices we give a
combinatorial deduction of the Mandelstam identities and viceversa, thus
showing that the two sets of relations are equivalent. We are able to extend
this construction to supermatrices in such a way that we obtain the Mandelstam
identities in this case, once the corresponding characteristic equation is
known.
