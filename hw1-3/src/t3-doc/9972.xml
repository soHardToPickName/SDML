<title>
Topologically Nontrivial Sectors of Maxwell Field Theory on Riemann
  Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the Maxwell field theory is considered on a closed and
orientable Riemann surface of genus $h>1$. The solutions of the Maxwell
equations corresponding to nontrivial values of the first Chern class are
explicitly constructed for any metric in terms of the prime form.
