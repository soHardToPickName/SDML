The Calogero Model - Anyonic Representation, Fermionic Extension and
  Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss several applications and extensions of our previous operator
solution of the $N$-body Calogero problem, \ie N particles in 1 dimension
subject to a two-body interaction of the form $\half \sum_{i,j}[ (x_i - x_j)^2
+ g/ {(x_i - x_j)^2}]$. Using a complex representation of the deformed
Heisenberg algebra underlying the Calogero model, we explicitly establish the
equivalence between this system and anyons in the lowest Landau level. A
construction based on supersymmetry is used to extend our operator method to
include fermions, and we obtain an explicit solution of the supersymmetric
Calogero model constructed by Freedman and Mende. We also show how the
dynamical $OSp(2;2)$ supersymmetry is realized by bilinears of modified
creation and annihilation operators, and how to construct a supersymmetic
extension of the deformed Heisenberg algebra.
