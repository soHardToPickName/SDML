<title>
The Dimension of Decompactified Spacetime from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The implications of string theory for understanding the dimension of
decompactified spacetime are discussed. Results from a computer model designed
to simulate expansion of the early universe during the string dominated phase
are presented. This model focuses on the effects of string winding modes on
inflation and is based on the theory of random walks. We demonstrate that our
decompactified four-dimensional spacetime can be explained by the proper choice
of initial conditions.
