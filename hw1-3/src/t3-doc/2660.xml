Some remarks on Whitham equations
</title>

<abstract>
  A number of formulas are displayed concerning Whitham theory for a simple
example of pure N=2 susy YM with gauge group SU(2). In particular this serves
to illuminate the role of Lambda and T derivatives and the interaction with
prepotentials F based on Seiberg-Witten and Whitham theory.
