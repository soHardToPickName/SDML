<title>
Computing the BRST Operator Used in Quantization of Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that for a large class of non-holonomic quantum mechanical
systems one can make the computation of BRST charge fully algorithmic. Two
computer algebra programs written in the language of {\tt REDUCE} are
described. They are able to realize the complex calculations needed to
determine the charge for general nonlinear algebras. Some interesting specific
solutions are discussed.
