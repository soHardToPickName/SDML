On the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal Description of SU$(\infty)$ Nahm Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the reduced Self-dual Yang-Mills theory described by the Nahm
equations can be carried over to the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism employed
recently in Self-dual gravity. Evidence of the existence of correspondence
between BPS magnetic monopoles and space-time hyper-K\"ahler metrics is given.
