<title>
(Generalized) Conformal Quantum Mechanics of 0-Branes and
  Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between the (generalized) conformal quantum mechanics
of 0-branes and the two-dimensional dilaton gravity. The two-dimensional
actions obtained from the supergravity effective actions for the (dilatonic)
0-branes through the compactification on a sphere are related to known
two-dimensional dilaton gravity models. The SL(2,R) symmetry of the
(generalized) conformal quantum mechanics is realized within such
two-dimensional models. The two-dimensional dilatonic gravity model derived
from the non-dilatonic 0-brane action is related to the Liouville theory and
therefore is conformal, whereas the two-dimensional model derived from the
dilatonic 0-brane action does not have the conformal symmetry.
