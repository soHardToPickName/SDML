<title>
Partial algebraization and a q-deformed harmonic oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  From the algebraic treatment of the quasi-solvable systems, and a
q-deformation of the associated $su(2)$ algebra, we obtain exact solutions for
the q-deformed Schrodinger equation with a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic
oscillator potential.
