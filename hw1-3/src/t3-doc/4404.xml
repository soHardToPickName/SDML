An overview of new supersymmetric gauge theories with 2-form gauge
  potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview of new 4d supersymmetric gauge theories with 2-form gauge
potentials constructed by various authors during the past five years is given.
The key role of three particular types of interaction vertices is emphasized.
These vertices are used to develop a connecting perspective on the new models
and to distinguish between them. One example is presented in detail to
illustrate characteristic features of the models. A new result on couplings of
2-form gauge potentials to Chern-Simons forms is presented.
