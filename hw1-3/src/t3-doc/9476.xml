Comments on Perturbative Dynamics of Non-Commutative Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the U(N) non-commutative Yang-Mills theory at the one-loop
approximation. We check renormalizability and gauge invariance of the model and
calculate the one-loop beta function. The interaction of the SU(N) gauge bosons
with the U(1) gauge boson plays an important role in the consistency check. In
particular, the SU(N) theory by itself is not consistent. We also find that the
theta --> 0 limit of the U(N) theory does not converge to the ordinary SU(N) x
U(1) commutative theory, even at the planar limit. Finally, we comment on the
UV/IR mixing.
