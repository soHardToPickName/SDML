<title>
One loop fermion contribution to the effective potential for constant
  SU(2) Yang-Mills fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a series expansion for the one loop fermion contribution to the
effective potential for constant A^a_\mu fields in SU(2) theory with a massive
fermionic doublet. The series converges for bounded electric fields in terms of
the magnetic fields and the gauge potentials. One finds that spontaneous
fermion pair creation may be absent for arbitrary strong pure electric fields,
with an appropriate choice of the classical currents.
