Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the gl(N)-NLS hierarchy on the half
  line
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe an algebraic framework for studying the symmetry properties of
integrable quantum systems on the half line. The approach is based on the
introduction of boundary operators. It turns out that these operators both
encode the boundary conditions and generate integrals of motion. We use this
direct relationship between boundary conditions and symmetry content to
establish the spontaneous breakdown of some internal symmetries, due to the
boundary.
