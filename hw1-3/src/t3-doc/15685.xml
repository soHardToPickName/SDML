Matrix Ernst Potentials and Orthogonal Symmetry for Heterotic String in
  Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A new matrix representation for low-energy limit of heterotic string theory
reduced to three dimensions is considered. The pair of matrix Ernst Potentials
uniquely connected with the coset matrix is derived. The action of the symmetry
group on the Ernst potentials is established.
