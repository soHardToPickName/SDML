Beta Function, C--Theorem and WDVV Equations in 4D N=2 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the exact $beta$--function of 4D N=2 SYM plays the role of the
metric whose inverse satisfies the WDVV--like equations $\F_{ikl}\beta^{lm}
\F_{mnj}=\F_{jkl}\beta^{lm}\F_{mni}$. The conjecture that the WDVV--like
equations are equivalent to the identity involving the $u$--modulus and the
prepotential $\F$, seen as a superconformal anomaly, sheds light on the
recently considered c-theorem for the N=2 SYM field theories.
