Yukawa Couplings involving Excited Twisted Sector States for ${\bf
  Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  A study is made for ${\bf Z}_M\times {\bf Z}_N$ orbifolds of the modification
of the form of the twisted sector Yukawa couplings when some of the states
involved are excited twisted sectors rather than twisted sector ground states.
