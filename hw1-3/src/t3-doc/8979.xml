Symmetries and symmetry-breaking in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a summary of a talk based on hep-th/9305139 and presented at the
SUSY-93 International Workshop. We study infinite dimensional unbroken gauge
symmetries which arise when time is toroidally compactified in string theory.
