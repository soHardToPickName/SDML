Space-time Supersymmetry in Asymmetric Orbifold Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the condition for the appearance of space-time supercharges in
twisted sectors of asymmetric orbifold models. We present a list of the
asymmetric $Z_N$-orbifold models which satisfy a simple condition necessary for
the appearance of space-time supercharges in twisted sectors. We investigate
whether or not such asymmetric orbifold models possess $N=1$ space-time
supersymmetry and obtain a new class of $N=1$ asymmetric orbifold models. It is
pointed out that the result of space-time supersymmetry does not depend on any
choice of a shift if the order of the left-moving degrees of freedom is
preserved.
