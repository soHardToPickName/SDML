<title>
Curvature-induced phase transition in three-dimensional Thirring model
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective potential of composite fermion fields in three-dimensional
Thirring model in curved spacetime is calculated in linear curvature
approximation. The phase transition accompanied by the creation of non-zero
chiral invariant bifermionic vector-like condensate is shown to exist. The type
of this phase transition is discussed.
