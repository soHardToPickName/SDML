Holographic Entropy on the Brane in de Sitter Schwarzschild Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The relationship between the entropy of de Sitter (dS) Schwarzschild space
and that of the CFT, which lives on the brane, is discussed by using
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) equations and Cardy-Verlinde formula. The
cosmological constant appears on the brane with time-like metric in dS
Schwarzschild background. On the other hand, in case of the brane with
space-like metric in dS Schwarzschild background, the cosmological constant of
the brane does not appear because we can choose brane tension to cancel it. We
show that when the brane crosses the horizon of dS Schwarzschild black hole,
both for time-like and space-like cases, the entropy of the CFT exactly agrees
with the black hole entropy of 5-dimensional AdS Schwarzschild background as it
happens in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
