On the regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in SU(2)
  Yang-Mills-dilaton theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The regularity of static axially symmetric solutions in SU(2)
Yang-Mills-dilaton theory is examined. We show that the solutions obtained
previously within a singular Ansatz for the non-abelian gauge field can be
gauge transformed into a regular form. The local form of the gauge
transformation is given on the singular axis and at the origin.
