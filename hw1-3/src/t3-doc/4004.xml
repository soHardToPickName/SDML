<title>
Chern-Simons from Dirichlet 2-brane instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  In the vicinity of points in Calabi-Yau moduli space where there are
degenerating three-cycles the low energy effective action of type IIA string
theory will contain significant contributions arising from membrane instantons
that wrap around these three-cycles. We show that the world-volume description
of these instantons is Chern-Simons theory.
