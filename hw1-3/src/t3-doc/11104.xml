Non-Abelian T-duality in Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the impact of non-Abelian T-duality transformations on a string
based cosmological model. The implementation of the pre-big-bang scenario is
investigated. We found a region of the dual phase where such a picture is
possible.
