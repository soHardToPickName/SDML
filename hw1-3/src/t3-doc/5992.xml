<title>
Dilatonic p-brane solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We find new 4-brane and 5-brane solitons in massive gauged $D=6$, $N=2$ and
$D=7$, $N=1$ supergravities. In each case, the solutions preserve half of the
original supersymmetry. These solutions make use of the metric and dilaton
fields only. We also present more general dilatonic $(D-2)$-branes in $D$
dimensions.
