Baryon Configurations in the UV and IR Regions of Type 0 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Type 0 string theory is considered as a dual model of a
non-supersymmetric gauge theory. A background geometry with N electric
D3-branes is calculated in UV/IR regions. In this paper, we study a D5-brane
around N D3-branes from the D5-brane world volume action as in the Type IIB
case, and we obtain some baryon configurations at UV/IR regions.
