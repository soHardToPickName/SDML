Free Boson Representation of $U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$
</title>

<abstract>
  A representation of the quantum affine algebra $U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$ of an
arbitrary level $k$ is realized in terms of three boson fields, whose $q
\rightarrow 1$ limit becomes the Wakimoto representation. An analogue of the
screening current is also obtained. It commutes with the action of
$U_{q}(\hat{sl_{2}})$ modulo total difference of some fields.
