Noncommutative supergeometry, duality and deformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a notion of $Q$-algebra that can be considered as a
generalization of the notion of $Q$-manifold (a supermanifold equipped with an
odd vector field obeying $\{Q,Q\} =0$). We develop the theory of connections on
modules over $Q$-algebras and prove a general duality theorem for gauge
theories on such modules. This theorem containing as a simplest case
$SO(d,d,{\bf Z})$-duality of gauge theories on noncommutative tori can be
applied also in more complicated situations. We show that $Q$-algebras appear
naturally in Fedosov construction of formal deformation of commutative algebras
of functions and that similar $Q$-algebras can be constructed also in the case
when the deformation parameter is not formal.
