M Theory and P-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Ten dimensional type IIA and IIB theories with p-branes are compactified to
8-dimensions. It is shown that resulting branes can be classified according to
the representations of $\bf {SL(3,Z) \times SL(2,Z)}$. These p-branes can also
be obtained by compactification of M theory on three torus and various
wrappings of membrane and five brane of the eleven dimensional theory. It is
argued that there is evidence for bound states of the branes in eight
dimensions as is the case in the interpretation of $\bf {SL(2,Z)}$ family of
string solutions obtained by Schwarz.
