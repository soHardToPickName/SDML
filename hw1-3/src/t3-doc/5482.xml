<title>
Topological versus Non--Topological Theories and $p-q$ Duality in $c \le
  1$ 2d Gravity Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the non--perturbative formulation for $c \leq 1$ string theory.
The field theory like formulation of topological and non--topological models is
presented. The integral representation for arbitrary $(p,q)$ solutions is
derived which explicitly obeys $p-q$ duality of these theories. The exact
solutions to string equation and various examples are also discussed.
