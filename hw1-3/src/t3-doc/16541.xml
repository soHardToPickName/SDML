Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study compact non-supersymmetric Z_N orbifolds in various dimensions. We
compute the spectrum of several tachyonic type II and heterotic examples and
partially classify tachyon-free heterotic models. We also discuss the relation
to compactification on K3 and Calabi-Yau manifolds.
