Nontriviality of Abelian gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models in four
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a particular class of Abelian gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models with
global U_L(N)xU_R(N) symmetry, where N is the number of fermion flavors. We
show, by treating the gauge interaction in the ladder approximation and
four-fermion interactions in the leading order of the 1/N expansion, that the
renormalization-group beta function of the U(1) gauge coupling has ultraviolet
stable fixed points for sufficiently large N. This implies the existence of a
nontrivial continuum limit.
