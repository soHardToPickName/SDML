One-loop Energy Corrections in the Nonabelian Gauge Field Theory in 2+1
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact constant solutions of field equations in the classical nonabelian SU(2)
field theory with the Chern-Simons topological mass in 2+1-dimensional
space-time have been obtained. One-loop contributions of boson and fermion
fluctuations to the gauge field energy have been calculated.
