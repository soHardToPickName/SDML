<title>
From hermitian matrix model to lattice gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  I consider a lattice model of a gauge field interacting with matrix-valued
scalars in $D$ dimensions. The model includes an adjustable parameter $\s$,
which plays role of the string tension. In the limit $\s=\infty$ the model
coincides with Kazakov-Migdal's ``induced QCD", where Wilson loops obey a zero
area law. The limit $\s=0$, where Wilson loops $W(C)=1$ independently of the
size of the loop, corresponds to the Hermitian matrix model. For $D=2$ and
$D=3$ I show that the model obeys the same combinatorics as the standard LGT
and therefore one may expect the area law behavior. In the strong coupling
expansion such a behavior is demonstrated.
