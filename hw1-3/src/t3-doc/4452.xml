<title>
The Gravitational Sector in the Connes-Lott Formulation of the Standard
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
We study the Riemannian aspect and the Hilbert-Einstein gravitational action of
the non-commutative geometry underlying the Connes-Lott construction of the
action functional of the standard model. This geometry involves a two-sheeted,
Euclidian space-time. We show that if we require the space of forms to be
locally isotropic and the Higgs scalar to be dynamical, then the Riemannian
metrics on the two sheets of Euclidian space-time must be identical. We also
show that the distance function between the two sheets is determined by a
single, real scalar field whose VEV sets the weak scale.
