Classification of Non-Abelian Chern-Simons Vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional self-dual Chern-Simons equations are equivalent to the
conditions for static, zero-energy vortex-like solutions of the (2+1)
dimensional gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Chern-Simons
matter-gauge coupling. The finite charge vacuum states in the Chern-Simons
theory are shown to be gauge equivalent to the finite action solutions to the
two-dimensional chiral model (or harmonic map) equations. The Uhlenbeck-Wood
classification of such harmonic maps into the unitary groups thereby leads to a
complete classification of the vacuum states of the Chern-Simons model. This
construction also leads to an interesting new relationship between $SU(N)$ Toda
theories and the $SU(N)$ chiral model.
