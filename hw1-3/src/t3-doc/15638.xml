Dual symmetry and the vacuum energy
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we present a new hidden symmetry in gravity for the scale factor
in the FRW model, for $k=0$. This exact symmetry vanishes the cosmological
constant. We interpret this hidden symmetry as a dual symmetry in the sense
that appears in the string theory.
