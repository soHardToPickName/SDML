<title>
BPS Solutions of Noncommutative Gauge Theories in Four and Eight
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the 1/4 BPS equations in the eight dimensional noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory found by Bak, Lee and Park. We explicitly construct some
solutions of the 1/4 BPS equations using the noncommutative version of the
ADHM-like construction in eight dimensions. From the calculation of topological
charges, we show that our solutions can be interpreted as the bound states of
the $D0$-$D4$-$D8$ with a $B$-field. We also discuss the structure of the
moduli space of the 1/4 BPS solutions and determine the metric of the moduli
space of the U(2) one-instanton in four and eight dimensions.
