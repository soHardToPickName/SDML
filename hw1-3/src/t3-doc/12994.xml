Deformation of the Wakimoto construction
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the extension of the Wakimoto construction to the $su(2)_k$
quantum current algebra and its associated $Z_k$ quantum parafermion algebra.
This construction is achieved in terms of various deformations of three
classical free boson fields. We also give the vertex operators corresponding to
the quantum spin-$j$ representation.
