<title>
Infrared Behaviour of Massive Scalar Matter coupled to Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of causal perturbation theory we consider a massive scalar
field coupled to gravity. In the field theoretic approach to quantum gravity
(QG) we start with a massless second rank tensor field. This tensor field is
then quantized in a covariant way in Minkowski space. This article deals with
the adiabatic limit for graviton radiative corrections in a scattering process
of two massive scalar particles. We compute the differential cross-section for
bremsstrahlung processes in which one of the outgoing particles emites a
graviton of low energy, a so called soft graviton. Since the emited graviton
will not be detected we have to integrate over all soft gravitons.
