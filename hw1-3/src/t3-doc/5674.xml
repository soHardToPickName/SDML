Exactly Solvable (0,2) Supersymmetric String Vacua With GUT Gauge Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a construction of modular invariant partition functions for
heterotic (0,2) supersymmetric classical string vacua. This generalization of
Gepner's construction yields GUT gauge groups E_6, SO(10), SU(5) and SU(3) x
SU(2) x U(1)^r, respectively. By calculating the massless spectrum of some of
these models we find strong indications that they correspond to (0,2) string
vacua discussed recently in the context of CYM/LG phases.
