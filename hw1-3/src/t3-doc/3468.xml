<title>
The Two-Dimensional String as a Topological Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A certain topological field theory is shown to be equivalent to the
compactified c=1 string. This theory is described in both Kazama-Suzuki coset
and Landau-Ginzburg formulations. The genus-g partition function and genus-0
multi-tachyon correlators of the c=1 string are shown to be calculable in this
approach. The KPZ formulation of non-critical string theory has a natural
relation to this topological model. (Talk given at the Nato Advanced Research
Workshop on `New Developments in String Theory, Conformal Models and
Topological Field Theory', Cargese, May 12-21 1993.)
