Null Branes in Curved Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider null bosonic p-branes in curved space-times. Some exact solutions
of the classical equations of motion and of the constraints for the null
membrane in general stationary, axially symmetrical, four dimensional, gravity
background are found.
