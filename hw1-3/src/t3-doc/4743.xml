<title>
A Monopole Metric
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate explicitly in terms of complete elliptic integrals the metric on
the moduli space of tetrahedrally-symmetric, charge four, SU(2) monopoles.
Using this we verify that in the asymptotic regime the metric of Gibbons and
Manton is exact up to exponentially suppressed corrections.
