<title>
A new realization of holography
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the old results of Cho, Soh, Park and Yoon, it is shown how higher m
+ n dimensional pure gravitational actions restricted to AdS_m times S^n
backgrounds admit a holographic reduction to a lower m-dimensional
Yang-Mills-like gauge theory of diffeomorphisms of S^n interacting with a
charged non-linear sigma model plus boundary terms by a simple tuning of the
AdS_m-throat and S^n-radius sizes. After performing a harmonic expansion of the
fields with respect to the internal coordinates and a subsequent integration
one obtains an m-dimensional effective action involving an infinite-component
field theory. The supersymmetrization program can be carried out in a
straighforward fashion.
