Equivalence between different canonical quantizations of the O(N)
  non-linear sigma model in the functional Schrodinger representation
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we consider the O(N) non-linear sigma model in its original
version as a second-class constrained field theory and then as a first-class
constrained field theory. We canonically quantize these versions of the model
in the functional Schrodinger representation by different methods: the
unconstrained formalism, the Dirac second-class and the Dirac first-class. We
demonstrate the equivalence between the different methods by showing that the
quantum energy spectrum of all of them are governed by the same functional
differential equation.
