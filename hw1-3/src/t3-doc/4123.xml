Bound States of String Networks and D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of non-threshold bound states of (p, q) string networks
and D3-branes, preserving 1/4 of the full type IIB supersymmetry, interpreted
as string networks dissolved in D3-branes. We also write down the expression
for the mass density of the system and discuss the extension of the
construction to other Dp-branes. Differences in our construction of string
networks with the ones interpreted as dyons in N=4 gauge theories are also
pointed out.
