Quantum Dust Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  By analysing the infinite dimensional midisuperspace of spherically symmetric
dust universes, and aply it to collapsing dust stars, one finds that the
general quantum state is a bound state. This leads to discrete spectrum. In the
case of a Schwarzschild black hole, the discrete spectrum implies Bekenstein
area quantization: the area of the horizon is an integer multiple of the Planck
area. Knowing the microscopic (quantum) states, we suggest a microscopic
interpretation of the thermodynamics of black holes: the degeneracy of the
quantum states forming a black hole, gives the Bekenstein- Hawking entropy. All
other thermodynamical quantities can be derived by using the standard
definitions.
