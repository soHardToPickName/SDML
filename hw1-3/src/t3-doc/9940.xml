<title>
Line Bundles Over Families of (SUPER) Riemann Surfaces. I: The
  Non-Graded Case
</title>

<abstract>
  A first step towards a systematic theory of relative line bundles over
SUSY-curves is presented. In this paper we deal with the case of relative line
bundles over families of ordinary Riemann surfaces. Generalizations of the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem and of the flatness theorem for line bundles are
discussed.
