Solitons and Helices: The Search for a Math-Physics Bridge
</title>

<abstract>
  We present evidence for an undiscovered link between N=2 supersymmetric
quantum field theories and the mathematical theory of helices of coherent
sheaves. We give a thorough review for nonspecialists of both the mathematics
and physics involved, and invite the reader to take up the search for this
elusive connection.
