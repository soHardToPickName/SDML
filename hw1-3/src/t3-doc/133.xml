<title>
Bosonization of Vector and Axial-Vector Currents in 3+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The bosonization of a massless fermionic field coupled to both vector and
axial-vector external sources is developed, following a path-integral approach.
The resulting bosonized theory contains two antisymmetric tensor fields whose
actions consist of non-local Kalb-Ramond-like terms plus interactions. Exact
bosonization rules that take the axial anomaly for the axial current into
account are derived, and an approximated bosonized action is constructed.
