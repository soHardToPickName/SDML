<title>
Exact Renormalization Group with Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  The development of the Exact Renormalization Group for fermionic theories is
presented, together with its application to the chiral Gross-Neveu model. We
focus on the reliability of various approximations, specifically the derivative
expansion and further truncations in the number of fields. The main differences
with bosonic theories are discussed.
