<title>
Note on the point-splitting procedure to evaluate vacuum fluctuation in
  certain cylindrically symmetric backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We revisit two-point function approaches used to study vacuum fluctuation in
wedge-shaped regions and conical backgrounds. Appearance of divergent integrals
is discussed and circumvented. The issue is considered in the context of a
massless scalar field in cosmic string spacetime.
