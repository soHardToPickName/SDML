Testing Abelian dyon - fermion Bound System
</title>

<abstract>
  Characteristics of Abelian dyon - fermion bound system, parity - violating
effects, a new series of energy spectra, effects related to the non - vanishing
electric dipole moment, feature of spin orientation etc, are analyzed and
compared with hydrogen - like atom. These analyses explore possibility of a new
approach of searching for dyons under bound condition.
