<title>
A remark on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the renormalization group
  flow
</title>

<abstract>
  The correspondence between the four-dimensional SU(N), $\cN = 4$ SYM taken at
large $N$ and the type II B SUGRA on the $AdS_5\times S_5$ background is
considered. We argue that the classical equations of motion in the SUGRA
picture can be interpreted as that of the renormalization group on the SYM
side. In fact, when the D3-brane is slightly excited higher derivative terms in
the field theory on its world-volume deform it form the conformal $\cN = 4$ SYM
limit. We give arguments in favor of that the deformation goes in the way set
by the SUGRA equations of motion. Concrete example of the s-wave dilaton is
considered.
