Level two irreducible representations of $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$, vertex
  operators, and their correlations
</title>

<abstract>
  Vertex operators associated with level two $U_q(\widehat{sl}_2)$ modules are
constructed explicitly using bosons and fermions. An integral formula is
derived for the trace of products of vertex operators. These results are
applied to give $n$-point spin correlation functions of an integrable $S=1$
quantum spin chain, extending an earlier work of Jimbo {\em et al} for the case
$S=1/2$.
