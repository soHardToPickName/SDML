Deconfining Phase Transition in 2+1 D: the Georgi-Glashow Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the finite temperature deconfining phase transition in 2+1
dimensional Georgi-Glashow model. We show explicitly that the transition is due
to the restoration of the magnetic $Z_2$ symmetry and that it is in the Ising
universality class. We find that neglecting effects of the charged $W$ bosons
leads to incorrect predictions for the value of the critical temperature and
the universality class of the transition, as well as for various correlation
functions in the high temperature phase. We derive the effective action for the
Polyakov loop in the high temperature phase and calculate the correlation
functions of magnetic vortex operators.
