<title>
Relating Weyl and diffeomorphism anomalies on super Riemann surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the Wess-Zumino action associated to the super Weyl anomaly, we
determine the local counterterm which allows to pass from this anomaly to the
chirally split superdiffeomorphism anomaly (as defined on a compact super
Riemann surface without boundary). The counterterm involves the graded
extension of the Verlinde functional and the results can be applied to the
study of holomorphic factorization of partition functions in superconformal
field theory.
