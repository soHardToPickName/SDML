Screening and D-brane Dynamics in Finite Temperature Superstring Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermal dynamics of D-branes and of open superstrings in background gauge
fields is studied. It is shown that D-brane dynamics forbids constant velocity
motion at finite temperature. T-duality is used to interpret this feature as a
consequence of the absence of an equilibrium state of charged strings at finite
temperature in a constant background electric field, as a result of Debye
screening of electric fields. The effective action for the Polyakov loop
operator is computed and the corresponding screening solutions are described.
The finite temperature theory is also used to illustrate the importance of
carefully incorporating Wu-Yang terms into the string path integral for compact
target spaces.
