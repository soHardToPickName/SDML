<title>
Uniqueness Theorem of Static Degenerate and Non-degenerate Charged Black
  Holes in Higher Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the uniqueness theorem for static higher dimensional charged black
holes spacetime containing an asymptotically flat spacelike hypersurface with
compact interior and with both degenerate and non-degenerate components of the
event horizon.
