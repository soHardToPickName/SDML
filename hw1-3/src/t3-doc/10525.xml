<title>
Custodial supersymmetry in non-supersymmetric quiver theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider non-supersymmetric quiver theories obtained by orbifolding the
N=4 supersymmetric U(K) gauge theory by a discrete Z_\Gamma group embedded in
the SU(4) R-symmetry group. We explicitly find that in such theories there are
no one-loop quadratic divergences in the effective potential.
 Moreover, when the gauge group U(n)^\Gamma of the quiver theory is
spontaneously broken down to the diagonal U(n), we identify a custodial
supersymmetry which is responsible for the fermion-boson degeneracy of the mass
spectrum.
