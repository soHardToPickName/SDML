A Quantum Analogue of the Boson-Fermion Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the classical boson-fermion correspondence in the context of the
$\widehat{sl(2)}$ current algebra at level 2. This particular algebra is ideal
to exhibit this correspondence because it can be realized either in terms of
three real bosonic fields or in terms of one real and one complex fermionic
fields. We also derive a fermionic realization of the quantum current algebra
$U_q(\widehat{sl(2)})$ at level 2 and by comparing this realization with the
existing bosonic one we extend the classical correspondence to the quantum
case.
