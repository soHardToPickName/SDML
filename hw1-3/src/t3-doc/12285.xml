Diffeomorphism Invariant Theories and Vector Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Einstein gravity in the Palatini first order formalism is shown to possess a
vector supersymmetry of the type encountered in the topological gauge theories.
A peculiar feature of the gravitationel theory is the link of this vector
supersymmetry with the field equation of motion of the Faddeev-Popov ghost
associated to diffeomorphism invariance.
