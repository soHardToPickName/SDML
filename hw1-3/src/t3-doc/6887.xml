<title>
On the critical behaviour of hermitean f-matrix models in the double
  scaling limit with f >= 3
</title>

<abstract>
  An algorithm for the isolation of any singularity of f-matrix models in the
double scaling limit is presented. In particular it is proved by construction
that only those universality classes exist that are known from 2-matrix models.
