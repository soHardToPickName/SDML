<title>
Covariant scalar representation of $iosp(d,2/2)$ quantization of the
  scalar relativistic particle
</title>

<abstract>
  A covariant scalar representation of $iosp(d,2/2)$ is constructed and
analysed in comparison with existing methods for the quantization of the scalar
relativistic particle. It is found that, with appropriately defined
wavefunctions, this $iosp(d,2/2)$ produced representation can be identified
with the state space arising from the canonical BFV-BRST quantization of the
modular invariant, unoriented scalar particle (or antiparticle) with admissible
gauge fixing conditions. For this model, the cohomological determination of
physical states can thus be obtained purely from the representation theory of
the $iosp(d,2/2)$ algebra.
