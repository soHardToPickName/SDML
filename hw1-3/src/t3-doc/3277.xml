q-deformed superconformal algebra on quantum superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  A quantum deformation of 4-dimensional superconformal algebra realized on
quantum superspace is investigated. We study the differential calculus and the
action of the quantum generators corresponding to $sl_q(1|4)$ which act on the
quantum superspace. We derive deformed $su(1|2,2)$ algebras from the deformed
$sl(1|4)$ algebra. Through a contraction procedure we obtain a deformed
super-Poincar{\'e} algebra.
