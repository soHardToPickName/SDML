<title>
AdS/CFT and BPS Strings in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N=2 superconformal theories defined on a 3+1 dimensional
hyperplane intersection of two sets of M5 branes. These theories have
(tensionless) BPS string solitons. We use a dual supergravity formulation to
deduce some of their properties via the AdS/CFT correspondence.
