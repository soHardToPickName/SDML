<title>
A possible solution of the black hole information paradox through
  quantum gravity unified with other interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  I try to argue that the only way out of the black hole information paradox is
through a unified quantum field theory of gravity and other interactions.
Superstring theory is especially interesting, since in a special limit, the
classical picture of 't Hooft emerges.
