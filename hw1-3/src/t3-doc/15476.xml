<title>
The exact renormalisation group equation and the perturbed unitary
  minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  The exact renormalisation group equation is studied for a two-dimensional
theory with exponential interaction and a background charge at infinity. The
motivation for studying this interaction is the flow between unitary minimal
models perturbed by Phi_{(1,3)}, and their realisation in terms of a quantum
group restricted sine-Gordon model.
