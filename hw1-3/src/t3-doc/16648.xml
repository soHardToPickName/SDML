More on Penrose Limit of AdS_4 x Q^{1,1,1}
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a Penrose limit of AdS_4 x Q^{1,1,1} that provides the pp-wave
geometry equal to the one in the Penrose limit of AdS_4 x S^7. We expect that
there exists a subsector of three dimensional N=2 dual gauge theory which has
enhanced N=8 maximal supersymmetry. We identify operators in the N=2 gauge
theory with 11-dimensional supergravity KK excitations in the pp-wave geometry
and describe how both the chiral multiplets and semi-conserved multiplets fall
into N=8 supermultiplets.
