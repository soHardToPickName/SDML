D-branes in PP-wave light cone string field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The cubic interaction vertex and the dynamical supercharges are constructed
for open strings ending on D7-branes, in light-cone superstring field theory in
PP-wave background. In this context, we write down the symmetry generators in
terms of the relevant group structure: SU(2) x SU(2) x SO(2) x SO(2),
originating from the eight transverse directions in the PP-wave background and
use the expressions to explicitly construct the vertex at the level of stringy
zero modes. The results are further generalized to include all the stringy
excitations as well.
