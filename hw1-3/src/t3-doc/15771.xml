<title>
Causal Poisson Brackets of the SL(2,R) WZNW Model and its Coset Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  From the basic chiral and anti-chiral Poisson bracket algebra of the SL(2,R)
WZNW model, non-equal time Poisson brackets are derived. Through Hamiltonian
reduction we deduce the corresponding brackets for its coset theories.
