Higher Order Calculations in Renormalization Group Approach to Matrix
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study higher order approximations in the renormalization group approach to
matrix models. We use constraint equations on the free energy resulting from a
freedom of field redefinitionsand obtain the effective beta function for a
single coupling constant to the fifth order. The fixed point and the string
susceptibility exponent are shown to approach the values obtained in the exact
solution as the order of approximations becomes higher.
