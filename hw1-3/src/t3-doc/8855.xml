3D reduction of the N-body Bethe-Salpeter equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform a 3D reduction of the two-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation, by
series expansion around a positive-energy instantaneous approximation of the
Bethe-Salpeter kernel, followed by another series expansion at the 3D level in
order to get a manifestly hermitian 3D potential. It turns out that this
potential does not depend on the choice of the starting approximation of the
kernel anymore, and can be written in a very compact form. This result can also
be obtained directly by starting with an approximation of the free propagator,
based on integrals in the relative energies instead of the more usual
delta-constraint. Furthermore, the method can be generalized to a system of N
particles, consisting in any combination of bosons and fermions. As an example,
we write the 3D equation for systems of two or three fermions exchanging
photons, in Feynman or Coulomb's gauge.
