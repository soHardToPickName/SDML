<title>
The Standard Model a la Connes-Lott
</title>

<abstract>
  The relations among coupling constants and masses in the standard model \`a
la Connes-Lott with general scalar product are computed in detail. We find a
relation between the top and the Higgs masses. For $m_t=174\pm22\ GeV$ it
yields $m_H=277\pm40\ GeV$. The Connes-Lott theory privileges the masses
$m_t=160.4\ GeV$ and $m_H=251.8\ GeV$.
