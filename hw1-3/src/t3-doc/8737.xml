On the SL(2,R) symmetry in Yang-Mills Theories in the Landau,
  Curci-Ferrari and Maximal Abelian Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  The existence of a SL(2,R) symmetry is discussed in SU(N) Yang-Mills in the
maximal Abelian Gauge. This symmetry, also present in the Landau and
Curci-Ferrari gauge, ensures the absence of tachyons in the maximal Abelian
gauge. In all these gauges, SL(2,R) turns out to be dynamically broken by ghost
condensates.
