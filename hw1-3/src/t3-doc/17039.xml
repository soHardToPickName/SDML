<title>
The General, Duality-Invariant Family of Non-BPS Black-Hole Solutions of
  N=4, d=4 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the most general family of stationary point-like solutions of pure
N=4, d=4 Supergravity characterized by completely independent electric and
magnetic charges, mass, angular momentum and NUT charge plus the asymptotic
values of the scalars. It includes, for specific values of the charges all
previously known BPS and non-BPS, extreme and non-extreme black holes and
Taub-NUT solutions. As a family of solutions, it is manifestly invariant under
T and S duality transformations and exhibits a structure related to the
underlying special geometry structure of the theory. Finally, we study briefly
the black-hole-type subfamily of metrics and give explicit expressions for
their entropy and temperature.
