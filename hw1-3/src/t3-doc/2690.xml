<title>
Path Integral for Relativistic Equations of Motion
</title>

<abstract>
  A non-Grassmanian path integral representation is given for the solution of
the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. The trajectories of the path integral
are rendered differentiable by the relativistic corrections. The
nonrelativistic limit is briefly discussed from the point of view of the
renormalization group.
