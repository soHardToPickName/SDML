Gross-Ooguri Phase Transition at Zero and Finite Temperature: Two
  Circular Wilson Loop Case
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of $AdS/CFT$ correspondence the two Wilson loop correlator is
examined at both zero and finite temperatures. On the basis of an entirely
analytical approach we have found for Nambu-Goto strings the functional
relation $d S_c^{(Reg)} / dL = 2 \pi k$ between Euclidean action $S_c$ and loop
separation $L$ with integration constant $k$, which corresponds to the
analogous formula for point-particles. The physical implications of this
relation are explored in particular for the Gross-Ooguri phase transition at
finite temperature.
