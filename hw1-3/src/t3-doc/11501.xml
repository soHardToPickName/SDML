Gravitating dyons and the Lue-Weinberg bifurcation
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitating t'Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopoles can be constructed when
coupling the Georgi-Glashow model to gravitation. For a given value of the
Higgs boson mass, these gravitating solitons exist up to a critical value of
the ratio of the vector meson mass to the Planck mass. The critical solution is
characterized by a degenerate horizon of the metric. As pointed out recently by
Lue and Weinberg, two types of critical solutions can occur, depending on the
value of the Higgs boson mass. Here we investigate this transition for dyons
and show that the Lue and Weinberg phenomenon is favorized by the presence of
the electric-charge degree of freedom.
