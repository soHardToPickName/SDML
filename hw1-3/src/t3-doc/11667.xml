Non-perturbative Enhanced Gauge Symmetries in the Gimon-Polchinski
  Orientifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the enhanced gauge symmetries at constant couplings in the moduli
space of the Gimon-Polchinski Orientifold. We show that whenever there is a
singularity of E_6, E_7 and E_8 type we get enhanced gauge symmetry U(5), U(6)
and U(8) respectively. This is due to the additional twisting involved in the
definition of the Gimon-Polchiniski orientifold.
