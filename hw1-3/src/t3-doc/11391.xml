<title>
Quantum Group Generators in Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  These are notes of a seminar given at the 30th International Symposium on the
Theory of Elementary Particles, Berlin-Buckow, August 1996. The material is
derived from collaborations with E. Cremmer and J.-L. Gervais, and C. Klimcik,
and is partially new. Within the general framework of Poisson-Lie symmetry, we
discuss two approaches to the problem of constructing moment maps, or
q-deformed Noether charges, that generate the quantum group symmetry which
appears in many conformal field theories. Concretely, we consider the case of
$U_q(sl(2))$ and the operator algebra that describes Liouville theory and other
models built from integer powers of screenings in the Coulomb gas picture.
