<title>
Light-Front Quantization of Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-front wavefunctions provide a frame-independent representation of
hadrons in terms of their physical quark and gluon degrees of freedom. The
light-front Hamiltonian formalism provides new nonperturbative methods for
obtaining the QCD spectrum and eigensolutions, including resolvant methods,
variational techniques, and discretized light-front quantization. A new method
for quantizing gauge theories in light-cone gauge using Dirac brackets to
implement constraints is presented. In the case of the electroweak theory, this
method of light-front quantization leads to a unitary and renormalizable theory
of massive gauge particles, automatically incorporating the Lorentz and 't
Hooft conditions as well as the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem.
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is represented by the appearance of zero modes of
the Higgs field leaving the light-front vacuum equal to the perturbative
vacuum. I also discuss an "event amplitude generator" for automatically
computing renormalized amplitudes in perturbation theory. The importance of
final-state interactions for the interpretation of diffraction, shadowing, and
single-spin asymmetries in inclusive reactions such as deep inelastic
lepton-hadron scattering is emphasized
