Callan-Symanzik and renormalization group equation in theories with
  spontaneously broken symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Callan-Symanzik and renormalization group equation are discussed for the
$U(1)$-axial model and it is shown that the symmetric model is not the
asymptotic version of the spontaneously broken one due to mass logarithms in
the $\beta$-functions. The Callan-Symanzik equation of the standard model is
seen to have the same form as the one of the simple model.
