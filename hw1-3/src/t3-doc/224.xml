<title>
Mathematical aspects of chiral gauge theories on the lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  For two decades it was believed that chiral symmetries cannot be realized in
lattice field theory but this has changed now. Highlights of these new
developments will be presented with emphasis on the mathematical structure of
the so called ``overlap''.
