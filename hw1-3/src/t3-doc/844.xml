On DBI action of the non-maximally symmetric D-branes on SU(2)
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the non-maximally symmetric D-branes on the SU(2)
group discussed in a previous article (hep-th/0205097). Using the two-form
defined in hep-th/0205097 the DBI action on the branes is constructed. This
action is checked for its agreement with CFT predictions. The geometry of the
branes is analyzed in detail, and the singularities of branes covering the
entire group are found.
