<title>
Commutative and noncommutative N=2 SYM in 2+1 from wrapped D6-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the supergravity duals of commutative and noncommutative non-abelian
gauge theories with N=2 in 2+1 dimensions. The moduli space on the Coulomb
branch of these theories is studied using supergravity.
