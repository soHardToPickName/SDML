<title>
On the Entropy of Quantum Fields in Black Hole Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the partition function for a scalar field in a static spacetime
background can be expressed as a functional integral in the corresponding
optical space, and point out that the difference between this and the
functional integral in the original metric is a Liouville type action. A
general formula for the free energy is derived in the high temperature
approximation and applied to various cases. In particular we find that
thermodynamics in the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om space has extra
singularities that make it ill-defined.
