<title>
A universal flow invariant in quantum field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A flow invariant is a quantity depending only on the UV and IR conformal
fixed points and not on the flow connecting them. Typically, its value is
related to the central charges a and c. In classically-conformal field
theories, scale invariance is broken by quantum effects and the flow invariant
a_{UV}-a_{IR} is measured by the area of the graph of the beta function between
the fixed points. There exists a theoretical explanation of this fact. On the
other hand, when scale invariance is broken at the classical level, it is
empirically known that the flow invariant equals c_{UV}-c_{IR} in massive
free-field theories, but a theoretical argument explaining why it is so is
still missing. A number of related open questions are answered here. A general
formula of the flow invariant is found, which holds also when the stress tensor
has improvement terms. The conditions under which the flow invariant equals
c_{UV}-c_{IR} are identified. Several non-unitary theories are used as a
laboratory, but the conclusions are general and an application to the Standard
Model is addressed. The analysis of the results suggests some new minimum
principles, which might point towards a better understanding of quantum field
theory.
