<title>
SO(2) symmetry of a Maxwell p-form theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a universal SO(2) symmetry of a p-form Maxwell theory for both odd
and even p. For odd p it corresponds to the duality rotations but for even p it
defines a new set of transformations which is not related to duality rotations.
In both cases a symmetry group defines a subgroup of the O(2,1) group of
R-linear canonical transformations which has also a natural representation on
the level of quantization condition for p-brane dyons.
