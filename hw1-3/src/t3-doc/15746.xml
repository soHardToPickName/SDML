Orientifolds of SU(2)/U(1) WZW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The orientifolds of SU(2)/U(1) gauged WZW models are investigated. In
particular, we construct the new type orientifolds and identify their
geometries. We closely follow the analysis of D-branes in the SU(2)/U(1) WZW
models, which was given by Maldacena, Moore and Seiberg.
