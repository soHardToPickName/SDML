<title>
Interacting Euclidean 3D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Euclidean 3D-gravity coupled to a Gaussian scalar massive matter
field in first-order dreibein formalism gives a quantum theory which has a
finite perturbative expansion around a non-vanishing background. We also
discuss a possible mechanism to generate a non-trivial background metric
starting from Rovelli-Smolin's loop observables.
