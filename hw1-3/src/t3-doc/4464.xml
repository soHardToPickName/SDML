Global Charges of Stationary Non-Abelian Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider stationary axially symmetric black holes in SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. We present a mass formula for these
stationary non-Abelian black holes, which also holds for Abelian black holes.
The presence of the dilaton field allows for rotating black holes, which
possess non-trivial electric and magnetic gauge fields, but don't carry a
non-Abelian charge.
