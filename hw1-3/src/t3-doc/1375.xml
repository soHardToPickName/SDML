<title>
Non-Supersymmetric Gauge Theories from D-Branes in Type 0 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct non-supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories arising as
effective theories of D-branes placed on various singularities in Type 0B
string theory. We mostly focus on models which are conformal in the large N
limit and present both examples appearing on self-dual D3-branes on orbifold
singularities and examples including orientifold planes. Moreover, we derive
type 0 Hanany-Witten setups with NS 5-branes intersected by D-branes and the
corresponding rules for determining the massless spectra. Finally, we discuss
possible duality symmetries (Seiberg-duality) for non-supersymmetric gauge
theories within this framework.
