Non-Abelian (2,0)-Super-Yang-Mills Coupled to Nonlinear Sigma-Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Following a previous work on Abelian (2,0)-gauge theories, one reassesses
here the task of coupling (2,0) relaxed Yang-Mills super-potentials to a
(2,0)-nonlinear Sigma-model, by gauging the isotropy or the isometry group of
the latter. One pays special attention to the extra "chiral-like"
component-field gauge potential that comes out from the relaxation of
constraints.
