"A Solvable Hamiltonian System" Integrability and Action-Angle Variables
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that the dynamical system charaterized by the Hamiltonian $ H =
\lambda N \sum_{j}^{N} p_j + \mu \sum_{j,k}^{N} {{(p_j p_k)}^{1\over 2}} \{ cos
[ \nu ( q_j - q_k)] \} $ proposed and studied by Calogero [1,2] is equivalent
to a system of {\it non-interacting} harmonic oscillators. We find the explicit
form of the conserved currents which are in involution. We also find the
action-angle variables and solve the initial value problem in simple form.
