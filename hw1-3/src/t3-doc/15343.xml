Tunneling Through Sphalerons: The O(3) Sigma-Model on a Cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct all instantons for the \nlsig\ on a cylinder, known not to exist
on a finite time interval. We show that the widest instantons go through
sphalerons. A re-interpretation of moduli-space transforms the scale parameter
$\rho$ to a boundary condition in time. This may give a handle on the
$\rho\rightarrow0$ divergent instanton gas.
