Self-Dual Yang-Mills: Symmetries and Moduli Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Geometry of the solution space of the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations
in Euclidean four-dimensional space is studied. Combining the twistor and
group-theoretic approaches, we describe the full infinite-dimensional symmetry
group of the SDYM equations and its action on the space of local solutions to
the field equations. It is argued that owing to the relation to a holomorphic
analogue of the Chern-Simons theory, the SDYM theory may be as solvable as 2D
rational conformal field theories, and successful nonperturbative quantization
may be developed. An algebra acting on the space of self-dual conformal
structures on a 4-space (an analogue of the Virasoro algebra) and an algebra
acting on the space of self-dual connections (an analogue of affine Lie
algebras) are described. Relations to problems of topological and N=2 strings
are briefly discussed.
