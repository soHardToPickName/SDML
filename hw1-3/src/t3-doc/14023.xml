String Theory in Electromagnetic Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A review of various aspects of superstrings in background electromagnetic
fields is presented. Topics covered include the Born-Infeld action, spectrum of
open strings in background gauge fields, the Schwinger mechanism,
finite-temperature formalism and Hagedorn behaviour in external fields, Debye
screening, D-brane scattering, thermodynamics of D-branes, and noncommutative
field and string theories on D-branes. The electric field instabilities are
emphasized throughout and contrasted with the case of magnetic fields. A new
derivation of the velocity-dependent potential between moving D-branes is
presented, as is a new result for the velocity corrections to the one-loop
thermal effective potential.
