<title>
On Duality in Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss non-abelian $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to an adjoint chiral
superfield $X$, and a number of fundamental chiral superfields $Q^i$. Using
duality, we show that turning on a superpotential $W(X)=\Tr\sum_{l=1}^k g_l
X^{l+1}$ leads to non-trivial long distance dynamics, a large number of
multicritical IR fixed points and vacua, connected to each other by varying the
coefficients $g_l$.
