<title>
Finite group discretization of Yang-Mills and Einstein actions
</title>

<abstract>
  Discrete versions of the Yang-Mills and Einstein actions are proposed for any
finite group. These actions are invariant respectively under local gauge
transformations, and under the analogues of Lorentz and general coordinate
transformations. The case Z_n \times Z_n \times...\times Z_n is treated in some
detail, recovering the Wilson action for Yang-Mills theories, and a new
discretized action for gravity.
