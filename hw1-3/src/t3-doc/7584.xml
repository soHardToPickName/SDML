QED$_{2+1}$ with Nonzero Fermion Density and Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  A general expression for the conductivity in the QED$_{2+1}$ with nonzero
fermion density in the uniform magnetic field is derived. It is shown that the
conductivity is entirely determined by the Chern-Simons coefficient:
$\sigma_{ij}=\varepsilon_{ij}~{\cal C}$ and is a step-function of the chemical
potential and the magnetic field.
