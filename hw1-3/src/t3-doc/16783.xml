Correlation functions of quantum q-oscillators
</title>

<abstract>
  Nonlinearity of electromagnetic field vibrations described by q-oscillators
is shown to produce essential dependence of second correlation functions on
intensity and deformation of Planck distribution. Experimental tests of such
nonlinearity are suggested.
