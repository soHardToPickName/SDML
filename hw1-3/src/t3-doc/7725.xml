<title>
All supersymmetric solutions of minimal supergravity in five dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  All purely bosonic supersymmetric solutions of minimal supergravity in five
dimensions are classified. The solutions preserve either one half or all of the
supersymmetry. Explicit examples of new solutions are given, including a large
family of plane-fronted waves and a maximally supersymmetric analogue of the
G\"odel universe which lifts to a solution of eleven dimensional supergravity
that preserves 20 supersymmetries.
