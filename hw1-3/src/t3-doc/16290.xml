<title>
Integrable Field Theories derived from 4D Self-dual Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We reformulate the self-dual Einstein equation as a trio of differential form
equations for simple two-forms. Using them, we can quickly show the equivalence
of the theory and 2D sigma models valued in an infinite-dimensional group,
which was shown by Park and Husain earlier. We also derive other field theories
including the 2D Higgs bundle equation. This formulation elucidates the
relation among those field theories.
