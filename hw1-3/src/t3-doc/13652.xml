Generalized Abelian S-duality and coset constructions
</title>

<abstract>
  Electric-magnetic duality and higher dimensional analogues are obtained as
symmetries in generalized coset constructions, similar to the axial-vector
duality of two dimensional coset models described by Rocek and Verlinde. We
also study global aspects of duality between p-forms and (d-p-2)-forms in
d-manifolds. In particular, the modular duality anomaly is governed by the
Euler character as in four and two dimensions. Duality transformations of
Wilson line operator insertions are also considered.
