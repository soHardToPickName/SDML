<title>
Nonperturbative SUSY Correlators at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate finite temperature effects on a correlation function in the two
dimensional supersymmetric nonlinear O(3) sigma model. The correlation function
violates chiral symmetry and at zero temperature it has been shown to be a
constant, which gives rise to a double-valued condensate. Within the bilinear
approximation we find an exact result in a one-instanton background at finite
temperature. In contrast to the result at zero temperature we find that the
correlation function decays exponentially at large distances.
