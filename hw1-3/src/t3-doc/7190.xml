<title>
Bargmann-Michel-Telegdi equation and one-particle relativistic approach
</title>

<abstract>
  A reexamination of the semiclassical approach of the relativistic electron
indicates a possible variation of its helicity for electric and magnetic static
fields applied along its global motion due to zitterbewegung effects,
proportional to the anomalous part of the magnetic moment.
