Effective Potential on Fuzzy Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective potential of quantized scalar field on fuzzy sphere is
evaluated to the two-loop level. We see that one-loop potential behaves like
that in the commutative sphere and the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism of the
radiatively symmetry breaking could be also shown in the fuzzy sphere system.
In the two-loop level, we use the heavy-mass approximation and the
high-temperature approximation to perform the evaluations. The results show
that both of the planar and nonplanar Feynman diagrams have inclinations to
restore the symmetry breaking in the tree level. However, the contributions
from planar diagrams will dominate over those from nonplanar diagrams by a
factor N^2. Thus, at heavy-mass limit or high-temperature system the quantum
field on the fuzzy sphere will behave like those on the commutative sphere. We
also see that there is a drastic reduction of the degrees of freedom in the
nonplanar diagrams when the particle wavelength is smaller than the
noncommutativity scale.
