Gravitational Couplings for Generalized Orientifold Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wess-Zumino action for generalized orientifold planes (GOp-planes) is
presented and a series power expantion is realized from which processes that
involves GOp-planes, RR-forms, gravitons and gaugeons, are obtained. Finally
non-standard GOp-planes are showed.
