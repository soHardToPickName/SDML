<title>
GUT Model Hierarchies from Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  By employing D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type I strings, we
construct the first examples of three generation string GUT models (PS-A
class), that contain at low energy exactly the standard model spectrum with no
extra matter and/or extra gauge group factors. They are based on the group
$SU(4)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$. The models are non-supersymmetric,
even though SUSY is unbroken in the bulk. Baryon number is gauged and its
anomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism. We also
discuss models (PS-B class) which at low energy have the standard model
augmented by an anomaly free U(1) symmetry and show that multibrane wrappings
correspond to a trivial redefinition of the surviving global U(1) at low
energies. There are no colour triplet couplings to mediate proton decay and
proton is stable. The models are compatible with a low string scale of energy
less that 650 GeV and are directly testable at present or future accelerators
as they predict the existence of light left handed weak fermion doublets at
energies between 90 and 246 GeV. The neutrinos get a mass through an
unconventional see-saw mechanism. The mass relation $m_e = m_d$ at the GUT
scale is recovered. Imposing supersymmetry at particular intersections
generates non-zero Majorana masses for right handed neutrinos as well providing
the necessary singlets needed to break the surviving anomaly free U(1), thus
suggesting a gauge symmetry breaking method that can be applied in general
left-right symmetric models.
