<title>
The Planckian Conspiracy: String Theory and the Black Hole Information
  Paradox
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been argued that the consistency of quantum theory with black hole
physics requires nonlocality not present in ordinary effective field theory. We
examine the extent to which such nonlocal effects show up in the perturbative
S-matrix of string theory.
