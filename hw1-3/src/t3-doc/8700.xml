<title>
The hypermultiplet low-energy effective action, N=2 supersymmetry
  breaking and confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  Some exact solutions to the hypermultiplet low-energy effective action in N=2
supersymmetric four-dimensional gauge field theories with massive `quark'
hypermultiplets are discussed. The need for a spontaneous N=2 supersymmetry
breaking is emphasized, because of its possible relevance in the search for an
ultimate theoretical solution to the confinement problem.
