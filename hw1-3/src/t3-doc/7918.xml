Gauge Invariant Correlators in Non-Commutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using perturbation theory, we explore the universal high momentum behavior of
correlation functions of gauge invariant operators in planar noncommutative
gauge theories. We find that the correlation functions are strongly enhanced
when pairs of momenta become antiparallel. In particular, there is a transition
from the previously noted exponential suppression of correlation functions at
high momenta to a more field theoretic behavior when the momenta of pairs of
operators antialign within a critical angle. Some of our calculations can be
extrapolated to strong coupling, and in particular we are able to reproduce
precisely the supergravity prediction for the behavior of two point functions,
including the coupling dependence.
