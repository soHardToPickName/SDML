<title>
Non-symplectic symmetries and bi-Hamiltonian structures of the rational
  Harmonic Oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  The existence of bi-Hamiltonian structures for the rational Harmonic
Oscillator (non-central harmonic oscillator with rational ratio of frequencies)
is analyzed by making use of the geometric theory of symmetries. We prove that
these additional structures are a consequence of the existence of dynamical
symmetries of non-symplectic (non-canonical) type. The associated recursion
operators are also obtained.
