Dirac-Born -Infeld Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Properties of the Dirac-Born-Infeld Lagrangian analogous to those of the
Nambu-Goto String are analysed. In particular the Lagrangian is shown to be
constant or zero on the space of solutions of the equations of motion if the
Lagrangian is taken to any power other than 1/2.
