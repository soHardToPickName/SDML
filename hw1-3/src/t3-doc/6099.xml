Chaos Suppression in the SU(2) Yang--Mills--Higgs System
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the classical chaos--order transition in the spatially homogenous
SU(2) Yang--Mills--Higgs system by using a quantal analog of Chirikov's
resonance overlap criterion. We obtain an analytical estimation of the range of
parameters for which there is chaos suppression.
