Kaluza-Klein Black Holes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact solutions of heterotic string theory corresponding to four-dimensional
magnetic black holes in $N=4$ supergravity are described. The solutions
describe the black holes in the throat limit, and consist of a tensor product
of an $SU(2)$ WZW orbifold with the linear dilaton vacuum, supersymmetrized to
$(1,0)$ world sheet SUSY. One dimension of the $SU(2)$ model is interpreted as
a compactified fifth dimension, leading to a four dimensional solution with a
Kaluza-Klein gauge field having a magnetic monopole background; this
corresponds to a solution in $N=4$ supergravity, since that theory is obtained
by dimensional reduction of string theory.
