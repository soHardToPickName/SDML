<title>
General relativistic analog solutions for Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Finding solutions to non-linear field theories, such as Yang-Mills theories
or general relativity, is usually difficult. The field equations of Yang-Mills
theories and general relativity are known to share some mathematical
similarities, and this connection can be used to find solutions to one theory
using known solutions of the other theory. For example, the Schwarzschild
solutions of general relativity can be shown to have a mathematically similar
counterpart in Yang-Mills theory. In this article we will discuss several
solutions to the Yang-Mills equations which can be found using this connection
between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. Some comments about the
possible physical meaning of these solutions will be discussed. In particular
it will be argued that some of these analog solutions of Yang-Mills theory may
have some connection with the confinement phenomenon. To this end we will
briefly look at the motion of test particles moving in the background potential
of the Schwarzschild analog solution.
