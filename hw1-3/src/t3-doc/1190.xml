<title>
On the Interquark Potential calculation from Dirac Brackets
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the binding energy of an infinitely heavy quark-antiquark pair from
Dirac brackets by computing the expectation value of the pure QCD Hamiltonian.
This procedure exploits the rich structure of the dressing around static
fermions. Some subtle points related to exhibing explicitly the interquark
energy are considered.
