<title>
Eleven dimensional supergravity as a constrained topological field
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a new first-order formulation of D=11 supergravity which shows
that that theory can be understood to arise from a certain topological field
theory by the imposition of a set of local constraints on the fields, plus a
lagrange multiplier term. The topological field theory is of interest as the
algebra of its constraints realizes the D=11 supersymmetry algebra with central
charges.
