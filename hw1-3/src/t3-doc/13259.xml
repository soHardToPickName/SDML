Poincar\'e algebra and space-time critical dimensions for paraspinning
  strings
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we paraquantize the spinning string theory in the
Neuveu-Shwarz model. Both the center of mass variables and the excitation modes
of the string verify paracommutation relations. Except the $[p^{\mu},p^{\nu}]$
commutator, the two other commutators of Poincar\'e algebra are satisfied. With
the sole use of trilinear relations we find existence possibilities of spinning
strings at space-time dimensions other than D=10.
