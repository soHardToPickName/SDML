<title>
Electrodynamics in the presence of an axion
</title>

<abstract>
  The low energy limit of an axion field coupled to gauge fields is
investigated through the behaviour of the gauge field propagator in a local
vaccum angle background. The local (singular) part of the effective action for
the axion field is calculated at one loop level. In the case of a timelike,
linearly growing axion field, representing a massive axion, we give an
asymptotic expansion of the causal propagator and we solve nonlocally for the
first coefficient. We show that, for a generic axionic background, short
distance propagation of the gauge fields is well defined.
