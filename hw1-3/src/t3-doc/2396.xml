N=3 and N=4 Two-Form Supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Lagrangeans of N=3 and N=4 two-form supergravities. The
two-form gravity theories are classically equivalent to the Einstein gravity
theories and can be formulated as gauge theories. The gauge algebras used here
can be identified with the subalgebra of N=3 superconformal algebra and
SU(2)\times SU(2)\times U(1)-extended N=4 superconformal algebra.
