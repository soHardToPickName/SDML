Rotating Dilaton Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum can
qualitatively change the properties of extremal charged black holes coupled to
a dilaton. In addition, the gyromagnetic ratio of these black holes is computed
and an exact rotating black string solution is presented.
