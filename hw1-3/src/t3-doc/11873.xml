<title>
Central potential and examples of hidden algebra structure
</title>

<abstract>
We propose two generalisations of the Coulomb potential equation of quantum
mechanics and investigate the occurence of algebraic eigenfunctions for the
corresponding Scrh\"odinger equations. Some relativistic counterparts of these
problems are also discussed.
