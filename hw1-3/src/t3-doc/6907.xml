Integrating the Chirally Split Diffeomorphism Anomaly on a Compact
  Riemann Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  A well-defined chirally split functional integrating the 2D chirally split
diffeomorphism anomaly is exhibited on an arbitrary compact Riemann surface
without boundary. The construction requires both the use of the Beltrami
parametrisation of complex structures and the introduction of a background
metric possibly subject to a Liouville equation. This formula reproduces in the
flat case the so-called Polyakov action. Although it works on the torus (genus
1), the proposed functional still remains to be related to a Wess-Zumino action
for diffeomorphisms.
