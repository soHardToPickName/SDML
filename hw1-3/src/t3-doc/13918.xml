<title>
Comparison of quantum field perturbation theory for the light front with
  the theory in lorentz coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  The relationship between the perturbation theory in light-front coordinates
and Lorentz-covariant perturbation theory is investigated. A method for finding
the difference between separate terms of the corresponding series without their
explicit evaluation is proposed. A procedure of constructing additional
counter-terms to the canonical Hamiltonian that compensate this difference at
any finite order is proposed. For the Yukawa model, the light-front Hamiltonian
with all of these counter-terms is obtained in a closed form. Possible
application of this approach to gauge theories is discussed.
