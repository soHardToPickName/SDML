<title>
A note on the Einstein equation in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show, using purely classical considerations and logical extrapolation of
results belonging to point particle theories, that the metric background field
in which a string propagates must satisfy an Einstein or an Einstein-like
equation. Additionally, there emerge restrictions on the worldsheet curvature,
which seems to act as a source for spacetime gravity, even in the absence of
other matter fields.
