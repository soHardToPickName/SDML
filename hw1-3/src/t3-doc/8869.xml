<title>
A universal non-quasitriangular quantization of the Heisenberg group
</title>

<abstract>
  A universal R--matrix for the quantum Heisenberg algebra h(1)q is presented.
Despite of the non--quasitriangularity of this Hopf algebra, the quantum group
induced from it coincides with the quasitriangular deformation already known.
