<title>
A connection between lattice and surgery constructions of
  three-dimensional topological field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between lattice construction and surgery construction
of three-dimensional topological field theories. We show that a class of the
Chung-Fukuma-Shapere theory on the lattice has representation theoretic
reformulation which is closely related to the Altschuler-Coste theory
constructed by surgery. There is a similar relation between the Turaev-Viro
theory and the Reshetikhin-Turaev theory.
