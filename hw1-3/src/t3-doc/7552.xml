<title>
Two Lectures on D-Geometry and Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a write-up of lectures given at the 1998 Spring School at the Abdus
Salam ICTP. We give a conceptual introduction to D-geometry, the study of
geometry as seen by D-branes in string theory, and to noncommutative geometry
as it has appeared in D-brane and Matrix theory physics.
