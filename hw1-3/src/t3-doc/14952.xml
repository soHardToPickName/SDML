Supersymmetry Enhancement of D-p-branes and M-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the supersymmetry of classical D-brane and M-brane configurations
and explain the dependence of Killing spinors on coordinates. We find that one
half supersymmetry is broken in the bulk and that supersymmetry near the
D-brane horizon is restored for $p\leq 3$, for solutions in the stringy frame,
but only for $p=3$ in the10d canonical frame. We study the enhancement for the
case of four intersecting D-3-branes in 10 dimensions and the implication of
this for the size of the infinite throat of the near horizon geometry in
non-compactified theory. We found some indications of universality of near
horizon geometries of various intersecting brane configurations.
