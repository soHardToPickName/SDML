<title>
Large N dualities from wrapped D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some aspects of the gravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories,
arising in the world-volume of D-branes wrapping supersymmetric cycles of
special holonomy manifolds, within the framework of lower dimensional gauged
supergravity.
