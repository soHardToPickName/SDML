ICMP lecture on Heterotic/F-theory duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The heterotic string compactified on an (n-1)-dimensional elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau Z-->B is conjectured to be dual to F-theory compactified on
an n-dimensional Calabi-Yau X-->B, fibered over the same base with elliptic K3
fibers. In particular, the moduli of the two theories should be isomorphic. The
cases most relevant to the physics are n=2, 3, 4, i.e. the compactification is
to dimensions d=8, 6 or 4 respectively. Mathematically, the richest picture
seems to emerge for n=3, where the moduli space involves an analytically
integrable system whose fibers admit rather different descriptions in the two
theories. The purpose of this talk is to review some of what is known and what
is not yet known about this conjectural isomorphism. Some of the underlying
mathematics of principal bundles on elliptic fibrations is reviewed in the
accompanying Taniguchi talk (hep-th/9802094).
