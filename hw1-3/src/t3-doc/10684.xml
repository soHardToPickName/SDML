<title>
Parity and CT realization in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that an essential assumption in the Vafa and Witten's theorem on P
and CT realization in vector-like theories, the existence of a free energy
density in Euclidean space in the presence of any external hermitian symmetry
breaking source, does not apply if the symmetry is spontaneously broken. The
assumption that the free energy density is well defined requires the previous
assumption that the symmetry is realized in the vacuum. Even if Vafa and
Witten's conjecture is plausible, actually a theorem is still lacking.
