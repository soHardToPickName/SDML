Higher Dimensional Charged Rotating Solutions in (A)dS Space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in
d-dimensions, all of which are asymptotically (anti)-de Sitter space-times.
They describe electrically charged rotating solutions, which are
generalizations of those found by Lemos (gr-qc/9404041). These solutions have
toroidal, planar or cylindrical horizons and can be interpreted as black holes,
or black strings/branes. We calculate the inverse temperature and entropy, and
then we use the Brown-York stress-tensor to calculate mass and angular momenta
of these solutions.
