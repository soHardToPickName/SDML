De Sitter Space from Warped Supergravity Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  The solutions of 10 and 11 dimensional supergravity that are warped products
of de Sitter space with a non-compact `internal' space are investigated. A
convenient form of the metric is found and it is shown that in each case the
internal space is asymptotic to a cone over a product of spheres. A consistent
truncation gives gauged supergravities with non-compact gauge groups. The BPS
domain wall solutions of the non-compact gauged supergravities are lifted to
warped solutions in 10 or 11 dimensions.
