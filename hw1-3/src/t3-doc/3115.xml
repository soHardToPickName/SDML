<title>
The Sen conjecture for fundamental monopoles of distinct type
</title>

<abstract>
  I exhibit a middle-dimensional square integrable harmonic form on the moduli
space of distinct fundamental BPS monopoles of an arbitrary Lie group. This is
in accord with Sen's S-duality conjecture. I also show that the moduli space
has no closed or bound geodesics.
