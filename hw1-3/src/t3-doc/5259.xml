<title>
Noncommutative Gauge Dynamics From The String Worldsheet
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how string theory can be used to reproduce the one-loop two-point
photon amplitude in noncommutative U(1) gauge theory. Using a simple
realization of the gauge theory in bosonic string theory, we extract from a
string cylinder computation in the decoupling limit the exact one loop field
theory result. The result is obtained entirely from the region of moduli space
where massless open strings dominate. Our computation indicates that the
unusual IR/UV singularities of noncommutative field theory do not come from
closed string modes in any simple way.
