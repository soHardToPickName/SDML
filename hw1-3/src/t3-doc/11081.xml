Linear $r$-Matrix Algebra for Systems Separable\\ in Parabolic
  Coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a hierarchy of many particle systems on the line with polynomial
potentials separable in parabolic coordinates. Using the Lax representation,
written in terms of $2\times 2$ matrices for the whole hierarchy, we construct
the associated linear $r$-matrix algebra with the $r$-matrix dependent on the
dynamical variables. A dynamical Yang-Baxter equation is discussed.
