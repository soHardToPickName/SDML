Renormalization group functions of QCD in large N_f
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the application of the critical point large N_f self-consistency
method to QCD. In particular we derive the O(1/N_f) d-dimensional critical
exponents whose epsilon-expansion determines the perturbative coefficients in
MSbar of the field dimensions, beta-function and various twist-2 operators
which occur in the operator product expansion of deep inelastic scattering.
