Super M-brane actions in adS_4 x S^7 and adS_7 x S^4
</title>

<abstract>
  The world-volume action of the M2 brane and the M5-brane in an adS_4 x S^7
and a adS_7 x S^4 background is derived to all orders in anticommuting
superspace coordinates. Contrary to recent constructions of super p-brane
actions relying on supercoset methods, we only use 11 dimensional supergravity
torsion and curvature constraints. Complete agreement between the two methods
is found. The simplification of the actions by choosing a suitable kappa-gauge
is discussed.
