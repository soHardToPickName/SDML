Dilaton-Axion hair for slowly rotating Kerr black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Campbell et al. demonstrated the existence of axion ``hair'' for Kerr black
holes due to the non-trivial Lorentz Chern-Simons term and calculated it
explicitly for the case of slow rotation. Here we consider the dilaton coupling
to the axion field strength, consistent with low energy string theory and
calculate the dilaton ``hair'' arising from this specific axion source.
