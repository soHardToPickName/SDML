<title>
Heat Kernel and Scaling of Gravitational Constants
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the non-local energy-momentum tensor of quantum scalar and spinor
fields in $2 w$-dimensional curved spaces. Working to lowest order in the
curvature we show that, while the non-local terms proportional to $\Box {\cal
R}$, $\Box \Box{\cal R}$, $\ldots, \Box^{w-2} {\cal R}$ are fully determined by
the early-time behaviour of the heat kernel, the terms proportional to ${\cal
R}$ depend on the asymptotic late-time behaviour. This fact explains a
discrepancy between the running of the Newton constant dictated by the RG
equations and the quantum corrections to the Newtonian potential.
