Large Random Matrices: Eigenvalue Distribution
</title>

<abstract>
  A recursive method is derived to calculate all eigenvalue correlation
functions of a random hermitian matrix in the large size limit, and after
smoothing of the short scale oscillations. The property that the two-point
function is universal, is recovered and the three and four-point functions are
given explicitly. One observes that higher order correlation functions are
linear combinations of universal functions with coefficients depending on an
increasing number of parameters of the matrix distribution.
