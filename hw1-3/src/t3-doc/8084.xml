Quons in Relativistic Theories Must be Bosons or Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  The quon algebra describes particles, ``quons,'' that are neither fermions
nor bosons using a label q that parametrizes a smooth interpolation between
bosons (q = +1) and fermions (q = -1). We derive ``conservation of statistics''
relations for quons in relativistic theories, and show that in relativistic
theories quons must be either bosons or fermions.
