<title>
On calculation of the off-shell renormalization functions in the R^2
  gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A new way how to calculate the off-shell renormalization functions within the
$R^2$-gravity has been proposed. The one-loop renormalization group equations
in the approach suggested have been constructed. The behaviour of effective
potential for an massless scalar field interacting with the quantum
gravitational field has been analyzed in this approach.
