The Exact Renormalization Group and First-Order Phase Transitions
</title>

<abstract>
  Studies of first-order phase transitions through the use of the exact
renormalization group are reviewed. In the first part the emphasis is on
universal aspects: We discuss the universal critical behaviour near weakly
first-order phase transitions for a three-dimensional model of two coupled
scalar fields -- the cubic anisotropy model. In the second part we review the
application of the exact renormalization group to the calculation of
bubble-nucleation rates. More specifically, we concentrate on the
pre-exponential factor. We discuss the reliability of homogeneous nucleation
theory that employs a saddle-point expansion around the critical bubble for the
calculation of the nucleation rate.
