Critical exponents of the Gross-Neveu model from the effective average
  action
</title>

<abstract>
  The phase transition of the Gross-Neveu model with N fermions is investigated
by means of a non-perturbative evolution equation for the scale dependence of
the effective average action. The critical exponents and scaling amplitudes are
calculated for various values of N in d=3. It is also explicitely verified that
the Neveu-Yukawa model belongs to the same universality class as the
Gross-Neveu model.
