Born-Infeld Corrections to D3 brane Action in $AdS_5\times S_5$ and N=4,
  d=4 Primary Superfields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider certain supersymmetric Born-Infeld couplings to the D3 brane
action and show that they give rise to massless and massive KK excitations of
type IIB on $AdS_5\times S_5$, in terms of singleton Yang-Mills superfields.
