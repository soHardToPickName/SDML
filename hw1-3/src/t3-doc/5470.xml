<title>
${\cal N}=1$ Theories and a Geometric Master Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the large $N$ limit of the class of U(N) ${\CN}=1$ SUSY gauge
theories with an adjoint scalar and a superpotential $W(\P)$. In each of the
vacua of the quantum theory, the expectation values $\la$Tr$\Phi^p$$\ra$ are
determined by a master matrix $\Phi_0$ with eigenvalue distribution
$\rho_{GT}(\l)$. $\rho_{GT}(\l)$ is quite distinct from the eigenvalue
distribution $\rho_{MM}(\l)$ of the corresponding large $N$ matrix model
proposed by Dijkgraaf and Vafa. Nevertheless, it has a simple form on the
auxiliary Riemann surface of the matrix model. Thus the underlying geometry of
the matrix model leads to a definite prescription for computing
$\rho_{GT}(\l)$, knowing $\rho_{MM}(\l)$.
