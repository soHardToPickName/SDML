A-D-E Polynomial and Rogers--Ramanujan Identities
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture polynomial identities which imply Rogers--Ramanujan type
identities for branching functions associated with the cosets $({\cal
G}^{(1)})_{\ell-1}\otimes ({\cal G}^{(1)})_{1} / ({\cal G}^{(1)})_{\ell}$, with
${\cal G}$=A$_{n-1}$ \mbox{$(\ell\geq 2)$}, D$_{n-1}$ $(\ell\geq 2)$,
E$_{6,7,8}$ $(\ell=2)$. In support of our conjectures we establish the correct
behaviour under level-rank duality for $\cal G$=A$_{n-1}$ and show that the
A-D-E Rogers--Ramanujan identities have the expected $q\to 1^{-}$ asymptotics
in terms of dilogarithm identities. Possible generalizations to arbitrary
cosets are also discussed briefly.
