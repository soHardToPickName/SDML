Introduction to the Superembedding Description of Superbranes
</title>

<abstract>
  Basics of the geometrical formulation of the dynamics of supersymmetric
objects are considered and its relation to conventional formulations of
superbranes is discussed. In particular, we demonstrate how the kappa-symmetry
of the Green-Schwarz formulation shows up from local worldvolume supersymmetry,
and briefly discuss applications of the superembedding approach.
