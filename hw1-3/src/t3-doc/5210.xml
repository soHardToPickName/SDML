Supergravity Null Scissors and Super-Crosses
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we construct the supergravity solutions for the orthogonally
intersecting null scissors and the fluxed D-strings. We name the latter as the
super-crosses according to their shape. It turns out that the smeared solutions
are U-dual related to the intersecting $(p,q)$-strings. Their open string
properties are also studied. As a by-product, we clarify the supersymmetry
conditions of D2-D2 pairs with most generic fluxes.
