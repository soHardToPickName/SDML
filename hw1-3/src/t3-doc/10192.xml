<title>
CP-violating phases in the CKM matrix in orbifold compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  The picture of CP-violation in orbifold compactifications in which the
$T$-modulus is at a complex fixed point of the modular group is studied.
CP-violation in the neutral kaon system and in the neutron electric dipole
moment are both discussed. The situation where the $T$-modulus takes complex
values on the unit circle which are not at a fixed point is also discussed.
