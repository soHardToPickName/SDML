<title>
Time Evolution of Non-Equilibrium Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  The time evolution of correlation functions in statistical systems is
described by an exact functional differential equation for the corresponding
generating functionals. This allows for a systematic discussion of
non-equilibrium physics and the approach to equilibrium without the need of
solving the nonlinear microscopic equations of motion or computing the time
dependence of the probability distribution explicitly.
