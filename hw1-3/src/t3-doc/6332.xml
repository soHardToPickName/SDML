<title>
Galileo invariant system and the motion of relativistic d-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We follow recent work and study the relativistic d-brane system in (d+1,1)
dimensions and its connection with a Galileo invariant system in (d,1)
dimensions. In particular, we solve d-brane systems in (2,1), (3,1) and (4,1)
dimensions and show that their solutions solve the corresponding Galileo
invariant systems in (1,1), (2,1), and (3,1) dimensions. The results are
extended to higher dimensions.
