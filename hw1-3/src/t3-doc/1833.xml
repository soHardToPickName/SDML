Ricci-Parallelizable Spaces in the NS-NS Sector: AdS_3 x S^7
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a class of nondilatonic solutions to the NS-NS sector of string
theory. The solutions consist of products of Ricci-parallelizable spaces with
adjusted radii. A representative of this class, AdS_3 x S^7, is presented in
detail. Some comments on possible brane connections are made.
