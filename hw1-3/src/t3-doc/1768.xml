<title>
The Standard Model in the Latticized Bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the manifestly gauge invariant effective Lagrangian in 3+1
dimensions describing the Standard Model in 4+1 dimensions, following the
transverse lattice technique. We incorporate split generation fermions and we
explore naturalness for two Higgs configurations: a universal Higgs VEV, common
to each transverse brane, and a local Higgs VEV centered on a single brane with
discrete exponential attenuation to other branes, emulating the
split-generation model. Extra dimensions, with explicit Higgs, do not
ameliorate the naturalness problem.
