Torsion, topology and CPT anomaly in two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the CPT anomaly of two-dimensional chiral U(1) gauge theory on a
torus with topologically nontrivial zweibeins corresponding to the presence of
spacetime torsion. The resulting chiral determinant can be expressed in terms
of the standard chiral determinant without torsion, but with modified spinor
boundary conditions. This implies that the two-dimensional CPT anomaly can be
moved from one spin structure to another by choosing appropriate zweibeins.
Similar results apply to higher-dimensional chiral gauge theories.
