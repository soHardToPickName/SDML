Clifford Algebraic Remark on the Mandelbrot Set of Two--Component Number
  Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate with the help of Clifford algebraic methods the Mandelbrot set
over arbitrary two-component number systems. The complex numbers are regarded
as operator spinors in D\times spin(2) resp. spin(2). The thereby induced
(pseudo) normforms and traces are not the usual ones. A multi quadratic set is
obtained in the hyperbolic case contrary to [1]. In the hyperbolic case a
breakdown of this simple dynamics takes place.
