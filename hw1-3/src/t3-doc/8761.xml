The Poisson-Sigma Model - A Nonlinear Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  I investigate the Poisson-sigma model on the classical and quantum level.
First I show how the interaction can be obtained by a deformation of the
classical master equation of an Abelian BF theory in two dimensions. On the
classical level this model includes various known two-dimensional field
theories, in particular the Yang-Mills theory. On the quantum level the
perturbation expansion of the path integral in the covariant gauge yields the
Kontsevich deformation formula. Finally I perform the calculation of the path
integral in a general gauge, and demonstrate how the derived partition function
reduces in the special case of a linear Poisson structure to the familiar form
of 2d Yang-Mills theory.
