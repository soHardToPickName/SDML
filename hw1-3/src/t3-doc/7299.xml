Gluon-Meson Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The QCD-vacuum is characterized by the Higgs phenomenon for colored scalar
fields. In this dual picture the gluons appear as the octet of vector mesons.
Also quarks and baryons are identified. Gluon-meson and quark-baryon duality
can account in a simple way for realistic masses of all low-mass hadrons and
for their interactions.
