Quantum Corrections for a Cosmological String Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate quantum corrections for a cosmological solution of the string
effective action. Starting point is a classical solution containing an
antisymmetric tensor field, a dilaton and a modulus field which has
singularities in the scalar fields. As a first step we quantize the scalar
fields near the singularity with the result that the singularities disappear
and that in general non-perturbative quantum corrections form a potential in
the scalar fields.
