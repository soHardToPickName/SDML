<title>
On the Effective N=1 Supergravity of M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the low-energy limit, M-theory compactified on S1/Z2 is formulated in
terms of Bianchi identities with sources localized at orbifold singularities
and anomaly-cancelling counterterms to the Wilson effective Lagrangian.
Compactifying to four dimensions on a Calabi-Yau space leads to N=1 local
supersymmetry. We derive a formulation of the effective supergravity which
explicitly relates four-dimensional supergravity multiplets and field equations
with these fundamental M-theory aspects. This formulation proves convenient for
the introduction in the effective supergravity of non-perturbative M-theory
contributions. It also applies to the universal sector of generic
compactifications with N=1 supersymmetry.
