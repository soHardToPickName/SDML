<title>
Bound states in nonrelativistic four-fermion interaction model
</title>

<abstract>
  The bound states of two particles are studied in frames of non-relativistic
quantum field model with current $\times$ current type interaction by analyzing
the Bethe-Salpeter amplitudes. The Bethe-Salpeter equations are obtained in
closed form. The existence of Goldstone mode corresponding to the spontaneous
breaking of additional SU(2) symmetry of the model is revealed.
