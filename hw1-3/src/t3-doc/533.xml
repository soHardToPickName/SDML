<title>
Dynamics and topology of the gauge-invariant gauge field in two-color
  QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonlinear integral equation that is responsible for the implementation of
the non-Abelian Gauss's law is applied to an investigation of the topological
features of two-color QCD and to a discussion of their relation to QCD
dynamics. We also draw a parallel between the nonuniqueness of the solutions of
the equations that govern the gauge-invariant gauge field and Gribov copies.
