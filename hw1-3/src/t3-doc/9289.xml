<title>
On the Fractional Electric Charge of a Magnetic Monopole at Nonzero
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend recent discussions about the effect of nonzero temperature on the
induced electric charge, due to CP violation, of a Dirac or an 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole. In particular, we determine the fractional electric
charge of a very small 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole coupled to light fermions at
nonzero temperature. If dyons with fractional electric charge exist in the
Weinberg-Salam model, as recently suggested in the literature, then their
charge too should be temperature dependent.
