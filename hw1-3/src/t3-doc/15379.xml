<title>
Ramond-Ramond Central Charges in the Supersymmetry Algebra of the
  Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  The free action for the massless sector of the Type II superstring was
recently constructed using closed RNS superstring field theory. The
supersymmetry transformations of this action are shown to satisfy an N=2 D=10
SUSY algebra with Ramond-Ramond central charges.
