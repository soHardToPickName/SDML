The Global Problem of Time
</title>

<abstract>
  Time does not obviously appear amongst the coordinates on the constrained
phase space of general relativity in the Hamiltonian formulation. Recent work
in finite-dimensional models claims that topological obstructions generically
make the global definition of time impossible. It is shown here that a time
coordinate can be globally defined on a constrained phase space by patching
together local time coordinates, just as coordinates are defined on
topologically non-trivial manifolds.
