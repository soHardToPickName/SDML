D-brane Wess--Zumino actions, T-duality and the cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometrical formulation of the T-duality rules for type II superstring
Ramond--Ramond fields is presented. This is used to derive the Wess-Zumino
terms in superstring D-brane actions, including terms proportional to the mass
parameter of the IIA theory, thereby completing partial results in the
literature. For non-abelian world-volume gauge groups the massive type IIA
D-brane actions contain non-abelian Chern--Simons terms for the Born--Infeld
gauge potential, implying a quantization of the IIA cosmological constant.
