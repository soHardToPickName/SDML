Two-Form Fields and the Gauge Theory Description of Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the absorption cross section on a black threebrane of two-form
perturbations polarized along the brane. The equations are coupled and we
decouple them for s-wave perturbations. The Hawking rate is suppressed at low
energies, and this is shown to be reflected in the gauge theory by a coupling
to a higher dimension operator.
