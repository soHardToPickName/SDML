A non-Abelian Chern-Simons term for non-BPS D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a Chern-Simons term for N coinciding non-BPS D-branes. Demanding
full U(N) invariance and compatibility with T-duality, it is shown that it is
necessary to introduce new interaction terms, through which the non-BPS
D-branes couple to all p-form RR fields.
