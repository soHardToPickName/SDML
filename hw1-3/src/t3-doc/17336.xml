<title>
Anyonic behavior of quantum group fermionic and bosonic systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the role that quantum group symmetries, in particular $SU_q(2)$,
play in a thermodynamic system at high temperatures. We show that the
interactions introduced by the quantum group symmetries, are such that a
quantum group gas describe repulsive and attractive behavior in two and three
spatial dimensions.
