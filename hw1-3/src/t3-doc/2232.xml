Effective matter superpotentials from Wishart random matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how within the Dijkgraaf-Vafa prescription one can derive
superpotentials for matter fields. The ingredients forming the nonperturbative
Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotentials arise from constrained matrix integrals,
which are equivalent to classical complex Wishart random matrices. The
mechanism is similar to the way the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential
arises from the matrix model measure.
