<title>
A Rejoinder on Quaternionic Projective Representations
</title>

<abstract>
  In a series of papers published in this Journal (J. Math. Phys.), a
discussion was started on the significance of a new definition of projective
representations in quaternionic Hilbert spaces. The present paper gives what we
believe is a resolution of the semantic differences that had apparently tended
to obscure the issues.
