<title>
On the construction of gauge theories from non critical type 0 strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate Polyakov's proposal of constructing Yang-Mills theories by
using non critical type 0 strings. We break conformal invariance by putting the
system at finite temperature and find that the entropy of the cosmological
solutions for these theories matches that of a gas of weakly interacting
Yang-Mills bosons, up to a numerical constant. The computation of the entropy
using the effective action approach presents some novelties in that the whole
contribution comes from the RR fields. We also find an area law and a mass gap
in the theory and show that such behavior persists for $p>4$. We comment on the
possible physical meaning of this result.
