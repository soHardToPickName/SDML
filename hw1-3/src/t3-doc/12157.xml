Cosmology in the Randall-Sundrum Brane World Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario for a positive tension brane in
a 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied extensively recently.
Here we extend it to more general situations. We consider the time-dependent
situation where the two sides of the brane are different AdS/Schwarzschild
spaces. We show that the expansion rate in these models during inflation could
be larger than in brane worlds with compactified extra dimensions of fixed
size. The enhanced expansion rate could lead to the production of density
perturbations of substantially larger amplitude.
