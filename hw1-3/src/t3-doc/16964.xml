On Calculation of $2+\veps$ RG Functions in the Gross Neveu Model from
  Large $N$ Expansions of Critical Exponents
</title>

<abstract>
  Using knowledge of the explicit $n$ dependence of the RG functions and
expressions of critical exponents in the framework of large $N$ expansion in
the Gross Neveu model we derive RG functions in 4- and 5-loop approximation.
