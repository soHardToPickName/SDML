<title>
The Gross-Neveu model on the light cone
</title>

<abstract>
We consider the (massive) Gross-Neveu model using the light cone quantization
where we solve the constraints explicitly. We show that the vacuum is trivial
and that the quantization fails when $m=0$. We discuss how the running coupling
constant emerges as a pure normal ordering effect in this context and the bound
state equation.
