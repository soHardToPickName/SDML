<title>
Algebraic and Geometric Structure of the Integrable Models recently
  Proposed by Calogero
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the integrability of the dynamical system recently proposed by
Calogero and characterized by the Hamiltonian $ H = \sum_{j,k}^{N} p_j p_k
\{\lambda + \mu cos [ \nu ( q_j - q_k)] \} $ is due to a simple algebraic
structure . It is shown that the integrals of motion are related to the
Casimiar invariants of of the $su(1,1)$ algebra. Our method shows clearly how
these types of systems can be generalized .
