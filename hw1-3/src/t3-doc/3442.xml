Anti-de Sitter Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a pedagogical introduction to certain aspects of supersymmetric field
theories in anti-de Sitter space. Among them are the presence of masslike terms
in massless wave equations, irreducible unitary representations and the
phenomenon of multiplet shortening.
