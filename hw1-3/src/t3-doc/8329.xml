<title>
On three dimensional bosonization
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss Abelian and non-Abelian three dimensional bosonization within the
path-integral framework. We present a systematic approach leading to the
construction of the bosonic action which, together with the bosonization recipe
for fermion currents, describes the original fermion system in terms of vector
bosons.
