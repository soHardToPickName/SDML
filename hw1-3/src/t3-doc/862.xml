<title>
From noncommutative space-time to quantum relativistic symmetries with
  fundamental mass parameter
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the simplest class of Lie-algebraic deformations of space-time
algebra, with the selection of $\kappa$-deformations as providing quantum
deformation of relativistic framework. We recall that the $\kappa$-deformation
along any direction in Minkowski space can be obtained. Some problems of the
formalism of $\kappa$-deformations will be considered. We shall comment on the
conformal extension of light-like $\kappa$-deformation as well as on the
applications to astrophysical problems.
