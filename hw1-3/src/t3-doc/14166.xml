Dilaton Gravity and No-Hair Theorem in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a general class of two-dimensional theories of the dilaton-gravity
type inspired by string theory and show that they admit charged
multiple-horizon black holes. These solutions are proved to satisfy scalar
no-hair theorems.
