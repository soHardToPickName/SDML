<title>
Midisuperspace-Induced Corrections to the Wheeler De Witt Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the midisuperspace of four dimensional spherically symmetric
metrics and the Kantowski-Sachs minisuperspace contained in it. We discuss the
quantization of the midisuperspace using the fact that the dimensionally
reduced Einstein Hilbert action becomes a scalar-tensor theory of gravity in
two dimensions. We show that the covariant regularization procedure in the
midisuperspace induces modifications into the minisuperspace Wheeler DeWitt
equation.
