Stationary Solutions and Closed Time-Like Curve in 2+1 Dimensional
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the general solution of the stationary problem of 2+1 dimensional
gravity in presence of extended sources, also endowed with angular momentum. We
solve explicitly the compact support property of the energy momentum tensor and
we apply the results to the study of closed time-like curves. In the case of
rotational symmetry we prove that the weak energy condition combined with the
absence of closed time-like curves at space infinity prevents the existence of
closed time-like curves everywhere in an open universe (conical space at
infinity).
