<title>
Free Field Representation For Massive Integrable Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach to massive integrable models is considered. It allows one to
find symmetry algebras which define spaces of local operators and to get
general integral representations for form-factors in the\ $ SU(2)$\ Thirring
and Sine-Gordon models.
