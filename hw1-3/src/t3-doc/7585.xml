GAMMA: A Mathematica package for performing gamma-matrix algebra and
  Fierz transformations in arbitrary dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We have developed a Mathematica package capable of performing gamma-matrix
algebra in arbitrary (integer) dimensions. As an application we can compute
Fierz transformations.
