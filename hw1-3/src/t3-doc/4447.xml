<title>
A doubled discretisation of abelian Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A new discretisation of a doubled, i.e. BF, version of the pure abelian
Chern-Simons theory is presented. It reproduces the continuum expressions for
the topological quantities of interest in the theory, namely the partition
function and correlation function of Wilson loops. Similarities with free
spinor field theory are discussed which are of interest in connection with
lattice fermion doubling.
