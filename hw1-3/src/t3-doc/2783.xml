<title>
The non-perturbative groundstate of Q.C.D and the local composite
  operator A_mu^2
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility that the dimension 2 condensate A_mu^2 has a
non zero non-perturbative value in Yang-Mills theory. We introduce a
multiplicatively renormalisable effective potential for this condensate and
show through two loop calculations that a non zero condensate is energetically
favoured.
