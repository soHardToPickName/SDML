Type IIA Orientifold Limit of M-Theory on Compact Joyce 8-Manifold of
  Spin(7)-Holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that M-theory compactified on a compact Joyce 8-manifold of
$Spin(7)$-holonomy, which yields an effective theory in $D = 3$ with $\N$ = 1
supersymmetry, admits at some special points in it moduli space a description
in terms of type IIA theory on an orientifold of compact Joyce 7-manifold of
$G_2$-holonomy. We find the evidence in favour of this duality by computing the
massless spectra on both M-thory side and type IIA side. For the latter, we
compute the massless spectra by going to the orbifold limit of the Joyce
7-manifold.
