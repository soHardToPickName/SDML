Gauge Transformations For Self/Anti-Self Charge Conjugate States
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge transformations of type-II spinors are considered in the
Majorana-Ahluwalia construct for self/anti-self charge conjugate states. Some
speculations on the relations of this model with the earlier ones are given.
