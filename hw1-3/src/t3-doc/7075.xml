<title>
Covariant Quantization with Extended BRST Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A short rewiev of covariant quantization methods based on BRST-antiBRST
symmetry is given. In particular problems of correct definition of Sp(2)
symmetric quantization scheme known as triplectic quantization are considered.
