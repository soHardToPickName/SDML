Consistency of the Hybrid Regularization with Higher Covariant
  Derivative and Infinitely Many Pauli-Villars
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the regularization and renormalization of the Yang-Mills theory in
the framework of the manifestly invariant formalism, which consists of a higher
covariant derivative with an infinitely many Pauli-Villars fields. Unphysical
logarithmic divergence, which is the problematic point on the Slavnov's method,
does not appear in our scheme, and the well-known vale of the renormalization
group functions are derived. The cancellation mechanism of the quadratic
divergence is also demonstrated by calculating the vacuum polarization tensor
of the order of $\Lambda^0$ and $\Lambda^{-4}$. These results are the evidence
that our method is valid for intrinsically divergent theories and is expected
to be available for the theory which contains the quantity depending on the
space-time dimensions, like supersymmetric gauge theories.
