<title>
Critical phenomena of gravitating monopoles in the spacetime of a global
  monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a numerical study of critical phenomena (including the
Lue-Weinberg phenomenon) arising for gravitating monopoles in a global monopole
spacetime. The equations of this model have been recently studied by Spinelly
et al. in a domain of parameter space away from the critical points.
