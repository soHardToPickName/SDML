Noncommutative planar particles: higher order versus first order
  formalism and supersymmetrization
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the supersymmetrization of two formulations of free
noncommutative planar particles -- in coordinate space with higher order
Lagrangian [1] and in the framework of Faddeev and Jackiw [2,3], with first
order action. In nonsupersymmetric case the first formulation after imposing
subsidiary condition eliminating internal degrees of freedom provides the
second formulation. In supersymmetric case one can also introduce the split
into ``external'' and ``internal'' degrees of freedom both describing
supersymmetric models.
