<title>
Delocalized Supergravity Solutions for Brane/Anti-brane Systems and
  their Bound States
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain various solutions for D=4 dipoles and their bound states whose U(1)
fields originate from various form fields in the effective string theories. We
oxidize such dipole solutions to D=10 to obtain delocalized supergravity
solutions for the brane/anti-brane pairs and their bound states. We speculate
on generalized harmonic superposition rules for supergravity solutions for
(intersecting) brane/anti-brane pairs.
