Composite leptons and quarks constructed as triply occupied
  quasiparticles in quaternionic quanutm mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  \noindent We propose a set of rules for constructing composite leptons and
quarks as triply occupied quasiparticles, in the quaternionic quantum mechanics
of a pair of Harari-Shupe preons $T$ and $V$. The composites fall into two
classes, those with totally antisymmetric internal wave functions, and those
with internal wave functions of mixed symmetry. The mixed symmetry states
consist of precisely the three spin 1/2 quark lepton families used in the
standard model (48 particle states, {\it not} counting the doubling arising
from antiparticles), plus one doublet of spin 3/2 quarks (24 particle states).
The antisymmetric states consist of a set of spin 3/2 leptonic states with
charges as in a standard model family (16 particle states), and a spin 1/2
leptonic fractionally charged doublet (4 particle states). We sketch ideas for
deriving our rules from a fundamental quaternionic preonic field theory.
