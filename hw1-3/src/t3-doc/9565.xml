<title>
The Superscattering Matrix for Two Dimensional Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A consistent Euclidean semi classical calculation is given for the
superscattering operator $\$ $ in the RST model for states with a constant flux
of energy. The $\$ $ operator is CPT invariant. There is no loss of quantum
coherence when the energy flux is less than a critical rate and complete loss
when the energy flux is critical.
