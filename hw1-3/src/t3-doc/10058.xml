Instantons and BPS Wilson loops
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-instanton contribution to a circular BPS Wilson loop in N=4 SU(2)
Yang--Mills theory is evaluated in semiclassical approximation. This article
amplifies part of a talk given by MBG at the Strings 2001 conference, Mumbai,
India (January 5-10, 2001). The results are preliminary and a more complete
exposition will be contained in a forthcoming paper.
