String Theory Formulation of anti-de Sitter Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter black hole is a
supersymmetric solution of the low-energy field equations of type IIB string
theory compactified on an Einstein space. A statistical interpretation of the
mass dependence of the entropy can be obtained from considerations of the
three-dimensional BTZ black hole.
