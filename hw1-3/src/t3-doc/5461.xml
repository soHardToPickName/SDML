Large Spin Strings in AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider strings with large spin in AdS_3xS^3xM with NS-NS background. We
construct the string configurations as solutions of SL(2,R) WZW theory. We
compute the relation between the space-time energy and spin, and show that the
anomalous correction is constant, and not logarithmic in the spin. This is in
contrast to the S-dual background with R-R charge where the anomalous
correction is logarithmic.
