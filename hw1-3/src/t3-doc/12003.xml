<title>
Is a classical description of stable non-BPS D-branes possible?
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the classical geometry produced by a stack of stable (i.e. tachyon
free) non-BPS D-branes present in K3 compactifications of type II string
theory. This classical representation is derived by solving the equations of
motion describing the low-energy dynamics of the supergravity fields which
couple to the non-BPS state. Differently from what expected, this configuration
displays a singular behaviour: the space-time geometry has a repulson-like
singularity. This fact suggests that the simplest setting, namely a set of
coinciding non-interacting D-branes, is not acceptable. We finally discuss the
possible existence of other acceptable configurations corresponding to more
complicated bound states of these non-BPS branes.
