<title>
Quantization of Solitons and the Restricted Sine-Gordon Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to compute form factors, matrix elements of local fields, in the
restricted sine-Gordon model, at the reflectionless points, by quantizing
solitons. We introduce (quantum) separated variables in which the Hamiltonians
are expressed in terms of (quantum) tau-functions. We explicitly describe the
soliton wave functions, and we explain how the restriction is related to an
unusual hermitian structure. We also present a semi-classical analysis which
enlightens the fact that the restricted sine-Gordon model corresponds to an
analytical continuation of the sine-Gordon model, intermediate between
sine-Gordon and KdV.
