Real Space Renormalization-Group for Configurational Random Walk Models
  on a Hierarchical Lattice. The Asymptotic End-to-End Distance of a Weakly
  SARW in Dimension Four
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a real space renormalization-group map for probabilities of random
walks on a hierarchical lattice. From this, we study the asymptotic behavior of
the end-to-end distance of a weakly self- avoiding random walk (SARW) that
penalizes the (self-)intersection of two random walks in dimension four on the
hierarchical lattice.
