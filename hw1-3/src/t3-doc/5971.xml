<title>
Maurer-Cartan forms and equations for two-dimensional
  superdiffeomorphisms
</title>

<abstract>
  We present explicit expressions for the Maurer-Cartan forms of the
superdiffeomorphism group associated to a super Riemann surface. As an
application to superconformal field theory, we use these forms to evaluate the
effective action for the factorized superdiffeomorphism anomaly.
