Brane-Bulk Interaction in Topological Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we address the problem of inducing boundary degrees of freedom
from a bulk theory whose action contains higher-derivative corrections. As a
model example we consider a topological theory with an action that has only a
``higher-derivative'' term. By choosing specific coupling of the brane to the
bulk we show that the boundary action contains gravity action along with some
higher-derivative corrections. The co-dimension of the brane is more than one.
In this sense the boundary is singular.
