N=4 Super Yang-Mills Low-Energy Effective Action at Three and Four Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the low-energy effective action in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory
with gauge group SU(n) spontaneously broken down to its maximal torus. Using
harmonic superspace technique we prove an absence of any three- and four-loop
corrections to non-holomorphic effective potential depending on N=2 superfield
strengths. A mechanism responsible for vanishing arbitrary loop corrections to
low-energy effective action is discussed.
