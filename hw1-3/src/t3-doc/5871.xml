Understanding Something About Nothing: Radiation Zeros
</title>

<abstract>
  Radiation symmetry is briefly reviewed, along with its historical,
experimental, computational, and theoretical relevance. A sketch of the proof
of a theorem for radiation zeros is used to highlight the connection between
gauge-boson couplings and Poincare transformations. It is emphasized that while
mostly bad things happen to good zeros, the weak-boson self-couplings continue
to be intimately tied to the best examples of exact or approximate zeros.
