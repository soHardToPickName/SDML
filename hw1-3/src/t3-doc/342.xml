Distance Formula for Grassmann Manifold --Applied to Anandan--Aharonov
  Type Uncertainty Relation--
</title>

<abstract>
  The time-energy uncertainty relation of Anandan-Aharonov is generalized to a
relation involving a set of quantum state vectors. This is achieved by
obtaining an explicit formula for the distance between two finitely separated
points in the Grassmann manifold.
