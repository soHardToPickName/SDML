Bulk Fields in Delocalized Dilatonic p-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study localization properties of various bulk fields on a dilatonic
p-brane which is delocalized along its transverse directions except one. We
find that all the bosonic and fermionic bulk fields can be localized on the
delocalized dilatonic p-brane in a strict sense, namely the Kaluza-Klein zero
modes of the bulk fields are normalizable and are localized around the brane,
for any values of the dilaton coupling parameter.
