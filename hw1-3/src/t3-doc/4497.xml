S-Duality, SL(2,Z) Multiplets and Killing Spinors
</title>

<abstract>
  The S-duality transformations in type IIB string theory can be seen as local
U(1) transformations in type IIB supergravity. We use this approach to
construct the $SL(2,Z)$ multiplets associated to supersymmetric backgrounds of
type IIB string theory and the transformation laws of their corresponding
Killing spinors.
