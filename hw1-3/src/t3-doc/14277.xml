<title>
Unitary matrix model for toroidal compactifications of M theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A unitary matrix model is proposed as the large-N matrix formulation of M
theory on flat space with toroidal topology. The model reproduces the motion of
elementary D-particles on the compact space, and admits membrane states with
nonzero wrapping around nontrivial 2-tori even at finite N.
