<title>
New N=1 Supersymmetric 3-dimensional Superstring Vacua from U-manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Making use of non-perturbative U-duality symmetries of type II strings we
construct new `superstring' vacua in three dimensions with N=1 supersymmetry.
This has an interpretation as compactifying formally from 13 dimensions
(S-theory) on Calabi-Yau 5-folds possessing a $T^3 \x T^2$ fibration. We
describe some part of the massless multiplets, given by the Hodge spectrum, and
point to a corresponding 5-brane configuration.
