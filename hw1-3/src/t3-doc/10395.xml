Thermal Amplitudes in DLCQ Superstrings on PP-Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the thermal partition function of DLCQ superstring on the
maximally supersymmetric pp-wave background, which is realized as the Penrose
limit of orbifolded $AdS_5\times S^5$ and known to be dual to the $\cN=2$
``large'' quiver gauge theory as shown by S. Mukhi, M. Rangamani and
E. Verlinde, hep-th/0204147. Making use of the path-integral technique, we
derive the manifestly modular invariant expression and show the equivalence
with the free energy of second quantized free superstring on this background.
The ``virtual strings'' wound around the temporal circle play essential roles
for realizing the modular invariance and for a simple analysis on the Hagedorn
temperature. We also calculate the thermal one-loop amplitudes of open strings
under the various backgrounds of the supersymmetric time-like and Euclidean
D-branes, and confirm the existence of correct open-closed string duality.
Furthermore, we extend these thermodynamical analysis to the 6-dimensional DLCQ
pp-waves with general RR and NSNS flux. These superstring vacua are similarly
derived from the supersymmetric (half SUSY) and non-supersymmetric orbifolds of
$AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M^4$ ($M^4 =T^4 $ or $K3$) by the appropriate Penrose
limits, giving rise to the SUSY enhancement as in the case of orbifolded $AdS_5
\times S^5$.
