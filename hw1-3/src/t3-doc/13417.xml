<title>
Symmetries and the Antibracket: The Batalin-Vilkovisky Method
</title>

<abstract>
  These lectures on the Batalin-Vilkovisky method of quantization were
delivered at "VII Mexican School of Particles and Fields", M\'erida, M\'exico,
October 30-November 6, 1996.
  In section II, we study the derivation of BV from Schwinger-Dyson-BRST
symmetry; in section III, we consider some generalizations of the BV structure
suggested by our approach. In section IV, we present a connection between the
Poisson bracket and the antibracket and use it to relate the Nambu bracketc
with the generalized $n$-brackets of section III.
