<title>
Continuous Constructive Fermionic Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We build the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model by a new method which requires
neither cluster expansion nor discretization of phase-space. It simply
reorganizes the perturbative series in terms of trees. With this method we can
for the first time define non perturbatively the renormalization group
differential equations of the model and at the same time construct explicitly
their solution.
