<title>
A Non-supersymmetric Deformation of the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We deform the AdS/CFT Correspondence by the inclusion of a non-supersymmetric
scalar mass operator. We discuss the behaviour of the dual 5 dimensional
supergravity field then lift the full solution to 10 dimensions. Brane probing
the resulting background reveals a potential consistent with the operator we
wished to insert.
