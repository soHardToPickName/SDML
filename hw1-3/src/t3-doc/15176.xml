<title>
Rigorous proof of attractive nature for Casimir force of p-odd
  hypercube
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir effect giving rise to an attractive force between the
configuration boundaries that confine the massless scalar field is rigorously
proven for odd dimensional hypercube with the Dirichlet boundary conditions and
different spacetime dimensions D by the Epstein zeta function regularization.
