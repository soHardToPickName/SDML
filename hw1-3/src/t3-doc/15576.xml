E(7) Symmetric Area of the Black Hole Horizon
</title>

<abstract>
  Extreme black holes with 1/8 of unbroken N=8 supersymmetry are characterized
by the non-vanishing area of the horizon. The central charge matrix has four
generic eigenvalues. The area is proportional to the square root of the
invariant quartic form of $E_{7(7)}$. It vanishes in all cases when 1/4 or 1/2
of supersymmetry is unbroken. The supergravity non-renormalization theorem for
the area of the horizon in N=8 case protects the unique U-duality invariant.
