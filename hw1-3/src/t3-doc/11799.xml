On a Model of the $\pi^+$ Meson
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we propose a model of the $\pi$ mesons. In this model we give
the formation of the $\pi^+$ meson by strong interaction and the decay of the
$\pi^+$ meson to the moun $\mu^+$ and the moun neutrino $\nu_{\mu}$ by weak
interaction. We give a mass machanism for the generation of the masses of the
$\pi^0$ meson, $\pi^+$ meson, the moun $\mu^+$ and the moun neutrino
$\nu_{\mu}$.
