<title>
A possible description of the quantum numbers in a hadronic string model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a critical composite superconformal string model to desribe
hadronic interactions. We present a new approach of introducing hadronic
quantum numbers in the scattering amplitudes. The physical states carry the
quantum numbers and form a common system of eigenfunctions of the operators in
this string model. We give explicit constructions of the quantum number
operators.
