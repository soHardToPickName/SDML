<title>
A new sequence for topological terms at any spacetime dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a sequence of quadratic topological terms of the Chern-Simons
type in different spacetime dimensions, related by dimensional compactification
and sharing the properties of topological mass generation and statistical
transmutation. The implications for bosonization in several dimensions are also
analyzed.
