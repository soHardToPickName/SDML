Anomalous Creation of Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In certain circumstances when two branes pass through each other a third
brane is produced stretching between them. We explain this phenomenon by the
use of chains of dualities and the inflow of charge that is required for the
absence of chiral gauge anomalies when pairs of D-branes intersect.
