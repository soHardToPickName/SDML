Gauge-invariant quark and gluon fields in QCD: dynamics, topology, and
  the Gribov ambiguity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the implementation, in a temporal-gauge formulation of QCD, of the
non-Abelian Gauss's law and the construction of gauge-invariant gauge and
matter fields. We then express the QCD Hamiltonian in terms of these
gauge-invariant operator-valued fields, and discuss the relation of this
Hamiltonian and the gauge-invariant fields to the corresponding quantities in a
Coulomb gauge formulation of QCD. We argue that a representation of QCD in
terms of gauge-invariant quantities could be particularly useful for
understanding low-energy phenomenology. We present the results of an
investigation into the topological properties of the gauge-invariant fields,
and show that there are Gribov copies of these gauge-invariant gauge fields,
which are constructed in the temporal gauge, even though the conditions that
give rise to Gribov copies do not obtain for the gauge-dependent temporal-gauge
fields.
