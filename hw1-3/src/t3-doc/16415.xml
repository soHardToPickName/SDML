Modified Laplace transformation method at finite temperature:
  application to infra-red problems of N component $\phi^4$ theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Modified Laplace transformation method is applied to N component $\phi^4$
theory and the finite temperature problem in the massless limit is re-examined
in the large N limit. We perform perturbation expansion of the dressed
thermal mass in the massive case to several orders and try the massless
approximation with the help of modified Laplace transformation. The
contribution with fractional power of the coupling constant is recovered from
the truncated massive series. The use of inverse Laplace transformation with
respect to the mass square is crucial in evaluating the coefficients of
fractional power terms.
