Black hole - D-brane correspondence: An example
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the connection between D-branes and black holes in one particular
case: a $D3$-brane compactified to four dimensions on $T^6/Z_3$. Using the
$D$-brane boundary state description we show the equivalence with a double
extremal N=2 black hole solution of four dimensional supergravity.
