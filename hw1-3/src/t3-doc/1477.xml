Observables in Topological Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Using topological Yang-Mills theory as example, we discuss the definition and
determination of observables in topological field theories (of Witten-type)
within the superspace formulation proposed by Horne. This approach to the
equivariant cohomology leads to a set of bi-descent equations involving the
BRST and supersymmetry operators as well as the exterior derivative. This
allows us to determine superspace expressions for all observables, and thereby
to recover the Donaldson-Witten polynomials when choosing a Wess-Zumino-type
gauge.
