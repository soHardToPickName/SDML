A Test of the AdS/CFT Duality on the Coulomb Branch
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the N=4 SU(N) Super Yang Mills theory on the Coulomb branch with
gauge symmetry broken to S(U(N_1) x U(N_2)). By integrating the W particles,
the effective action near the IR SU(N_i) conformal fixed points is seen to be a
deformation of the Super Yang Mills theory by a non-renormalized, irrelevant,
dimension 8 operator. The correction to the two-point function of the dilaton
field dual operator near the IR is related to a three-point function of chiral
primary operators at the conformal fixed points and agrees with the classical
gravity prediction, including the numerical factor.
