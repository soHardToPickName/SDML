<title>
The classical basis for $\kappa$-deformed Poincar\'e (super)algebra and
  the second $\kappa$-deformed supersymmetric Casimir
</title>

<abstract>
  We present here the general solution describing generators of \kdef \poin
algebra as the functions of classical \poin algebra generators as well as the
inverse formulae. Further we present analogous relations for the generators of
N=1 D=4 \kdef \poin superalgebra expressed by the classical \poin superalgebra
generators. In such a way we obtain the \kdef \poin (super)algebras with all
the quantum deformation present only in the coalgebra sector. Using the
classical basis of \kdef \poin superalgebra we obtain as a new result the
$\k$-deformation of supersymmetric covariant spin square Casimir.
