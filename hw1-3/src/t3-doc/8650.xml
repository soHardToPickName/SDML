Hidden Superconformal Symmetry in M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The bosonic sectors of the eleven dimensional and IIA supergravity theories
are derived as non-linear realisations. The underlying group includes the
conformal group, the general linear group and as well as automorphisms of the
supersymmetry algebra. We discuss the supersymmetric extension and argue that
Osp(1/64) is a symmetry of M theory. We also derive the effective action of the
closed bosonic string as a non-linear realisation.
