Phenomenology of local scale invariance: from conformal invariance to
  dynamical scaling
</title>

<abstract>
  Statistical systems displaying a strongly anisotropic or dynamical scaling
behaviour are characterized by an anisotropy exponent theta or a dynamical
exponent z. For a given value of theta, we construct local scale
transformations which can be viewed as scale transformations with a
space-time-dependent dilatation factor. Two distinct types of local scale
transformations are found. The first type may describe strongly anisotropic
scaling of static systems with a given value of theta, whereas the second type
may describe dynamical scaling with a dynamical exponent z. Local scale
transformations act as a dynamical symmetry group of certain non-local
free-field theories. Known special cases of local scale invariance are
conformal invariance for theta=1 and Schrodinger invariance for theta=2. The
hypothesis of local scale invariance implies that two-point functions of
quasiprimary operators satisfy certain linear fractional differential
equations, which are constructed from commuting fractional derivatives. The
explicit solution of these yields exact expressions for two-point correlators
at equilibrium and for two-point response functions out of equilibrium.
Aparticularly simple and general form is found for the two-time autoresponse
function. These predictions are explicitly confirmed at the uniaxial Lifshitz
points in the ANNNI and ANNNS models and in the aging behaviour of simple
ferromagnets such as the kinetic Glauber-Ising model and the kinetic spherical
model with a non-conserved order parameter undergoing either phase-ordering
kinetics or non-equilibrium critical dynamics.
