<title>
Dynamical Flavor Symmetry Breaking by a Magnetic Field in $2+1$
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that in $2+1$ dimensions, a constant magnetic field is a strong
catalyst of dynamical flavor symmetry breaking, leading to generating a fermion
dynamical mass even at the weakest attractive interaction between fermions. The
essence of this effect is that in a magnetic field, in $2+1$ dimensions, the
dynamics of fermion pairing is essentially one-dimensional. The effect is
illustrated in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in a magnetic field. The low-energy
effective action in this model is derived and the thermodynamic properties of
the model are considered. The relevance of this effect for planar condensed
matter systems and for $3+1$ dimensional theories at high temperature is
pointed out.
