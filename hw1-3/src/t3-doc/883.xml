Tunneling of Born-Infeld Strings to D2-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A Born-Infeld theory describing a D2-brane coupled to a 4-form RR field
strength is considered, and the general solutions of the static and Euclidean
time equations are derived and discussed. The period of the bounce solutions is
shown to allow a consideration of tunneling and quantum-classical transitions
in the sphaleron region. The order of such transitions, depending on the
strength of the RR field strength, is determined. A criterion is then derived
to confirm these findings.
