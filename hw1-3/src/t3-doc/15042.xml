Open strings, simple currents and fixed points
</title>

<abstract>
  Some applications of simple current techniques and fixed point resolution to
theories of open strings are discussed. In addition to a brief review of work
presented in two recent papers with L. Huiszoon and N. Sousa, some new results
concerning uniqueness of crosscap coefficients are presented, as well as a
strange sum rule for the modular matrix implied by the existence of crosscaps.
