An Effective Action for Quasi-elastic Scatterings in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  A new effective action for the high energy quark-quark scatterings is
obtained by applying a scaling approximation to the QCD action. The propagators
are shown to factorize into the transverse and the longitudinal parts so that
the scattering amplitudes are given in terms of the products of two dimensional
$S$-matrices. we show that our action provides a natural effective field theory
for the Lipatov's theory of quark scatterings with quasi-elastic unitarity. The
amplitude with quasi-elastic unitarity obtained from this action shows `Regge'
behavior and is eikonalized.
