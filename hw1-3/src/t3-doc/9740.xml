D6 branes and M theory geometrical transitions from gauged supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the supergravity duals of supersymmetric theories arising in the
world-volume of D6 branes wrapping holomorphic two-cycles and special
Lagrangian three-cycles within the framework of eight dimensional gauged
supergravity. When uplifted to 11d, our solutions represent M-theory on the
background of, respectively, the small resolution of the conifold and a
manifold with G_2 holonomy. We further discuss on the flop and other possible
geometrical transitions and its implications.
