<title>
On the string-inspired approach to QED in external field
</title>

<abstract>
  Strassler's formulation of the string-derived Bern-Kosower formalism is
extended to consider QED processes in homogeneous constant external field. A
compact expression for the contribution of the one-loop with arbitrary number
of external photon lines is given for scalar QED. Extension to spinor QED is
shortly discussed.
