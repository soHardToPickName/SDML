Moving Five-Branes in Low-Energy Heterotic M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct cosmological solutions of four-dimensional effective heterotic
M-theory with a moving five-brane and evolving dilaton and T modulus. It is
shown that the five-brane generates a transition between two asymptotic
rolling-radii solutions. Moreover, the five-brane motion always drives the
solutions towards strong coupling asymptotically. We present an explicit
example of a negative-time branch solution which ends in a brane collision
accompanied by a small-instanton transition. The five-dimensional origin of
some of our solutions is also discussed.
