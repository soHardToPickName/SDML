Hidden Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Inspired by the concept of complementarity, we present a illustrative model
for the weak interactions with unbroken gauge symmetry and unbroken
supersymmetry. The observable particles are bound states of some more
fundamental particles. Supersymmetry is broken at the macroscopic scale of the
observable particles by a discrete symmetry but remains exact at the scale of
the fundamental particle and is thus hidden. This provides a link between
theories at very high energies and the observed particle physics.
Supersymmetric particles are confined in usual matter.
