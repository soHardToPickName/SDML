Notes on Orientifolds of Rational Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review and develop the construction of crosscap states associated with
parity symmetries in rational conformal field theories. A general method to
construct crosscap states in abelian orbifold models is presented. It is then
applied to rational U(1) and parafermion systems, where in addition we study
the geometrical interpretation of the corresponding parities.
