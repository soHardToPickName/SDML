Finite Yang-Mills Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Monte Carlo methods to directly evaluate D-dimensional SU(N)
Yang-Mills partition functions reduced to zero Euclidean dimensions, with and
without supersymmetry. In the non-supersymmetric case, we find that the
integrals exist for D=3, N>3 and D=4, N>2 and, lastly, D >= 5, N >= 2. We
conclude that the D=3 and D=4 integrals exist in the large N limit, and
therefore lead to a well-defined, new type of Eguchi-Kawai reduced gauge
theory. For the supersymmetric case, we check, up to SU(5), recently proposed
exact formulas for the D=4 and D=6 D-instanton integrals, including the
explicit form of the normalization factor needed to interpret the integrals as
the bulk contribution to the Witten index.
