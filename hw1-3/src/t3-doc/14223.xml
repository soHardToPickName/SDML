BMN operators with vector impurities, Z_2 symmetry and pp-waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the coefficients of three-point functions of vector BMN
operators. We find that these coefficients coincide with those of the
three-point functions of scalar BMN operators. This is in agreement with the
Z_2 symmetry of the pp-wave string theory. Our results confirm the
vertex--correlator pp-wave duality for BMN operators with vector impurities.
