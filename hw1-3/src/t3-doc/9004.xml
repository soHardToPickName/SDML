A Picture of D-branes at Strong Coupling II. Spinning Partons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Born-Infeld D-brane action in the limit when the string coupling
goes to infinity. The resulting actions is presented in an arbitrary background
and shown to describe a foliation of the world-volume by strings. Using a
recently developed ``degenerate'' supergravity the parton picture is shown to
be applicable also to supersymmetric D-branes.
