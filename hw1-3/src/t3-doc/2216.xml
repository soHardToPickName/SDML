More on scattering of Chern-Simons vortices
</title>

<abstract>
    I derive a general formalism for finding kinetic terms of the effective
Lagrangian for slowly moving Chern-Simons vortices. Deformations of fields
linear in velocities are taken into account. From the equations they must
satisfy I extract the kinetic term in the limit of coincident vortices. For
vortices passing one over the other there is locally the right-angle
scattering. The method is based on analysis of field equations instead of
action functional so it may be useful also for nonvariational equations in
nonrelativistic models of Condensed Matter Physics.
