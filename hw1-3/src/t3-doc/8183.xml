<title>
Logarithmic Behaviours in the Feigin-Fuchs Construction of the c=-2
  Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain logarithmic behaviours of a four-point correlation function in the
c=-2 conformal field theory by using the Feigin-Fuchs construction. It becomes
an indeterminate form by a naive evaluation, but is obtained by introducing an
appropriate regularization procedure.
