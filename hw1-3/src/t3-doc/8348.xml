BRS Invariance of Unoriented Open-Closed String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the full action for the unoriented open-closed string field theory
which is based on the \alpha=p^+ HIKKO type vertices. The BRS invariance of the
action is proved up to the terms which are expected to cancel the anomalous
one-loop contributions. This implies that the system is invariant under the
gauge transformations with open and closed string field parameters up to the
anomalies.
