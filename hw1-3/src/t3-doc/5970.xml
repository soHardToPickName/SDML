Mersenne Primes, Polygonal Anomalies and String Theory Classification
</title>

<abstract>
  It is pointed out that the Mersenne primes $M_p=(2^p-1)$ and associated
perfect numbers ${\cal M}_p=2^{p-1}M_p$ play a significant role in string
theory; this observation may suggest a classification of consistent string
theories.
