A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF ALAIN CONNES' VERSION OF THE STANDARD MODEL IV
</title>

<abstract>
We give a detailed account of the computation of the Yang-Mills action for the
Connes-Lott model with general coupling constant in the commutant of the
$K$-cycle. This leads to tree-approximation results amazingly compatible with
experiment, yielding a first indication on the Higgs mass.
