<title>
Regularisation of classical self interaction in strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A general method of regularisation of classical self interaction in strings
is extended from the electromagnetic case (for which it was originally
developed) to the gravitation case, for which the result can also be
represented as a renormalisation.
