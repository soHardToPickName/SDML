<title>
Projective modules over the fuzzy four-sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe how to reduce the fuzzy four-sphere algebra to a set of four
independent raising and lowering oscillator operators. In terms of them we
derive the projector valued operators for the fuzzy four-sphere, which are the
global definition of k-instanton connections over this noncommutative base
manifold.
