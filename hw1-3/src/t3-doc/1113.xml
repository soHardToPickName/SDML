<title>
Charged Macroscopic type II Strings and their Networks
</title>

<abstract>
  We write down charged macroscopic string solutions in type II string
theories, compactified on torii, and present an explicit solution of the spinor
Killing equations to show that they preserve 1/2 of the type II
supersymmetries. The S-duality symmetry of the type IIB string theory in
ten-dimensions is used to write down the SL(2,Z) multiplets of such strings and
the corresponding 1/2 supersymmetry conditions. Finally we present examples of
planar string networks, using charged macroscopic (p,q)-strings. An interesting
feature of some of these networks, which preserve 1/4 supersymmetry, is a
required alignment among three parameters, namely the orientation of strings, a
U(1) phase associated with the maximal compact subgroup of SL(2, Z), and an
(angular) parameter associated with a solution generating transformation, which
is responsible for creating charges and currents on the strings.
