Fusion Rules for Extended Current Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The initial classification of fusion rules have shown that rational conformal
field theory is very limited. In this paper we study the fusion rules of extend
ed current algebras. Explicit formulas are given for the S matrix and the
fusion rules, based on the full splitting of the fixed point fields. We find
that in s ome cases sensible fusion rules are obtained, while in others this
procedure lea ds to fractional fusion constants.
