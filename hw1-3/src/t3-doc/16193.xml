Constrained effective potential in hot QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Constrained effective potentials in hot gauge theory give the probability
that a configuration p of the order parameter (Polyakov loop) occurs. They are
important in the analysis of surface effects and bubble formation in the
plasma. The vector potential appears non-linearly in the loop; in weak coupling
the linear term gives rise to the traditional free energy graphs. But the
non-linear terms generate insertions of the constrained modes into the free
energy graphs, through renormalisations of the Polyakov loop. These insertions
are gauge dependent and are necessary to cancel the gauge dependence of the
free energy graphs. The latter is shown, through the BRST identities, to have
again the form of constrained mode insertions. It also follows, that absolute
minima of the potential are at the centergroup values of the loop. We evaluate
the two-loop contributions for SU(N) gauge theories, with and without quarks,
for the full domain of the N-1 variables.
