<title>
Vacuum effective action and inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider vacuum quantum effects in the Early Universe, which may lead to
inflation. The inflation is a direct consequence of the supposition that, at
high energies, all the particles can be described by the weakly interacting,
massless, conformally invariant fields. We discuss, from the effective field
theory point of view, the stability of inflation, transition to the FRW
solution, and also possibility to study metric and density perturbations.
