The M-theory dual of a 3 dimensional theory with reduced supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper, Polchinski and Strassler found a string theory dual of a
gauge theory with reduced supersymmetry. Motivated by their approach, we
perturb the $\N=8$ theory living on a set of N M2 branes to $\N=2$, by adding
fermion mass terms. We obtain M-theory duals corresponding to M2 branes
polarized into M5 branes, in $AdS_4 \times S_7$. In the course of doing this we
come across an interesting feature of the M5 brane action, which we comment on.
Depending on the fermion masses we obtain discrete or continuous vacua for our
theories. We also obtain dual descriptions for domain walls, instantons and
condensates.
