<title>
A Proposal for Lowering the Coupling Unification Scale
</title>

<abstract>
  In the presence of an external electromagnetic field an ensemble of short
open strings in equilibrium with the heat bath provided by the Euclidean
worldvolume of a stack of Dbranes undergoes a continuous transition to a long
string phase. The transition temperature is at or below the string scale. We
point out that this phenomenon provides a simple mechanism within String Theory
for the lowering of the strong-electro-weak coupling unification scale by up to
two orders of magnitude relative to the string scale.
