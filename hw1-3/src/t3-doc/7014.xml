Some Comments on QCD String
</title>

<abstract>
  We try to draw lessons for higher dimensions from the string representations
recently derived for large $N$ Yang-Mills theory by Gross and Taylor, Kostov,
and others, and call attention to three characteristics that should be expected
of a string theory precisely equivalent to a higher dimensional gauge theory:
continuous world-sheets; strong coupling at short distances; and negative
weights. To appear in the proceedings of the Strings '93 Berkeley conference.
