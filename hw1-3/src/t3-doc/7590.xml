<title>
The Static Gauge Potential with a Cutoff
</title>

<abstract>
  The static potential, corresponding to the interaction of two heavy sources
is computed for $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang Mills in the strong 't Hooft
coupling regime by using the AdS/CFT conjecture and performing a computation of
a rectangular Wilson loop at a finite distance of the boundary.
