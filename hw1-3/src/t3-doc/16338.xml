<title>
Perturbative Evaluation of the Effective Action for a Self-Interacting
  Conformal Field on a Manifold with Boundary
</title>

<abstract>
  In a series of three projects a new technique which allows for higher-loop
renormalisation on a manifold with boundary has been developed and used in
order to assess the effects of the boundary on the dynamical behaviour of the
theory. Commencing with a conceptual approach to the theoretical underpinnings
of the, underlying, spherical formulation of Euclidean Quantum Field Theory
this overview presents an outline of the stated technique's conceptual
development, mathematical formalism and physical significance.
