<title>
UV-regularization of field discontinuities
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonperturbative regularization of UV-divergencies, caused by finite
discontinuities in the field configuration, is discussed in the context of
1+1-dimensional kink models. The relationship between this procedure and the
appearance of "quantum copies" of classical kink solutions is studied in detail
and confirmed by conventional methods of soliton quantization.
