<title>
Pair of accelerated black holes in an anti-de Sitter background: the AdS
  C-metric
</title>

<abstract>
  The anti-de Sitter C-metric (AdS C-metric) is characterized by a quite
interesting new feature when compared with the C-metric in flat or de Sitter
backgrounds. Indeed, contrarily to what happens in these two last exact
solutions, the AdS C-metric only describes a pair of accelerated black holes if
the acceleration parameter satisfies A>1/L, where L is the cosmological length.
The two black holes cannot interact gravitationally and their acceleration is
totally provided by the pressure exerted by a strut that pushes the black holes
apart. Our analysis is based on the study of the causal structure, on the
description of the solution in the AdS 4-hyperboloid in a 5D Minkowski
embedding spacetime, and on the physics of the strut. We also analyze the cases
A=1/L and A<1/L that represent a single accelerated black hole in the AdS
background.
