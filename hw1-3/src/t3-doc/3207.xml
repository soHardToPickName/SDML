<title>
Weyl Group Invariance and p-brane Multiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we study the actions of the Weyl groups of the U duality
groups for type IIA string theory toroidally compactified to all dimensions
$D\ge 3$. We show how these Weyl groups implement permutations of the field
strengths, and we discuss the Weyl group multiplets of all supersymmetric
$p$-brane solitons.
