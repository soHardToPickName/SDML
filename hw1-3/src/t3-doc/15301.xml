<title>
Quantum Riemann surfaces, 2D gravity and the geometrical origin of
  minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a recent paper by Takhtajan, we propose a formulation of 2D quantum
gravity whose basic object is the Liouville action on the Riemann sphere
$\Sigma_{0,m+n}$ with both parabolic and elliptic points. The identification of
the classical limit of the conformal Ward identity with the Fuchsian projective
connection on $\Sigma_{0,m+n}$ implies a relation between conformal weights and
ramification indices. This formulation works for arbitrary $d$ and admits a
standard representation only for $d\le 1$. Furthermore, it turns out that the
integerness of the ramification number constrains $d=1-24/(n^2-1)$ that for
$n=2m+1$ coincides with the unitary minimal series of CFT.
