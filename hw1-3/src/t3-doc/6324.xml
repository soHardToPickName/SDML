<title>
Open membranes in a constant C-field background and noncommutative
  boundary strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the dynamics of open membrane boundaries in a constant C-field
background. We follow the analysis for open strings in a B-field background,
and take some approximations. We find that open membrane boundaries do show
noncommutativity in this case by explicit calculations. Membrane boundaries are
one dimensional strings, so we face a new type of noncommutativity, that is,
noncommutative strings.
