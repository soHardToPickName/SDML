Boundary Correlators in 2D Quantum Gravity: Liouville versus Discrete
  Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate a class of two-point boundary correlators in 2D quantum gravity
using its microscopic realization as loop gas on a random surface. We find a
perfect agreement with the two-point boundary correlation function in Liouville
theory, obtained by V. Fateev, A. Zamolodchikov and Al. Zamolodchikov. We also
give a geometrical meaning of the functional equation satisfied by this
two-point function.
