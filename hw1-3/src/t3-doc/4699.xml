<title>
Central Extension of Extended Supergravities in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize central-charge relations and differential identities of N=2
Special Geometry to N extended supergravity in any dimension 4 \leq D <10,
and p-extended objects. We study the extremization of the ADM mass per unit
of p-volume of BPS extended objects. Runaway solutions for a ``dilaton''
degree of freedom leading to a vanishing result are interpreted as BPS
extremal states having vanishing Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy.
