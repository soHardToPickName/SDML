<title>
New approach to the non-perturbative physics
</title>

<abstract>
  It was shown that the non-perturbative properties of the vacuum are described
by the quantum fluctuations around the classical background with zero canonical
momentum. The vacuum state has been built and checked in the framework of the
sigma models in two dimentions.
