Are M-atrix theory and Maldacena's conjecture related?
</title>

<abstract>
  We give arguments in the support of a relation between M-atrix theory and
Maldacena's conjecture. M-atrix theory conjecture implies the equivalence of
11-D light-cone supergravity and strongly-coupled (0+1)-D SYM. Maldacena's
SUGRA/SYM duality conjecture implies, in the one dimensional SYM case, the
equivalence between strongly-coupled (0+1)-D SYM and 11-D supergravity
compactified on a spatial circle in the formal Seiberg-Sen limit. Using the
classical equivalence between 11-D supergravity on a light-like circle and on a
spatial circle in the formal Seiberg-Sen limit, we argue that in the (0+1)-D
SYM case, the large-N M-atrix theory in the supergravity regime is equivalent
to SUGRA/SYM duality.
