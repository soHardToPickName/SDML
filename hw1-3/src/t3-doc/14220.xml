<title>
The Symplectic Structure of N=2 Supergravity and its Central Extension
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on the formulation of $N=2$ $D=4$ supergravity coupled to $n_V$
abelian vector multiplets in presence of electric and magnetic charges. General
formulae for the (moduli dependent) electric and magnetic charges for the
$n_V+1$ gauge fields are given which reflect the symplectic structure of the
underlying special geometry. The specification to Type IIB strings compactified
on Calabi-Yau manifolds, with gauge group $U(1)^{h_{21}+1}$ is given.
