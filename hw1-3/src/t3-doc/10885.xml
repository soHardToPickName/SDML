<title>
Metric On Quantum Spaes
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the analogue of the metric tensor in case of $q$-deformed
differential calculus. We analyse the consequences of the existence of such
metric, showing that this enforces severe restrictions on the parameters of the
theory. We discuss in detail the examples of the Manin plane and the
$q$-deformation of $SU(2)$. Finally we touch the topic of relations with the
Connes' approach.
