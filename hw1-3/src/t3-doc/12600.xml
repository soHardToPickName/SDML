Free energy decreases along Wilson renormalization group trajectories
</title>

<abstract>
  The free energy is shown to decrease along Wilson renormalization group
trajectories, in a dimension-independent fashion, for $d>2.$ The argument
assumes the monotonicity of the cutoff function, and positivity of a spectral
representation of the two point function. The argument is valid to all orders
in perturbation theory.
