Boundary structure constants for the A-series Virasoro minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider A-series modular invariant Virasoro minimal models on the upper
half plane. From Lewellen's sewing constraints a necessary form of the bulk and
boundary structure constants is derived. Necessary means that any solution can
be brought to the given form by rescaling of the fields. All constants are
expressed essentially in terms of fusing (F-) matrix elements and the
normalisations are chosen such that they are real and no square roots appear.
It is not shown in this paper that the given structure constants solve the
sewing constraints, however random numerical tests show no contradiction and
agreement of the bulk structure constants with Dotsenko and Fateev. In order to
facilitate numerical calculations a recursion relation for the F-matrices is
given.
