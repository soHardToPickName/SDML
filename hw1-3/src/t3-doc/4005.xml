<title>
Stability of Randall-Sundrum brane-world and tachyonic scalar
</title>

<abstract>
  We address the behaviour of the scalar field with negative mass squared in
the five dimensional AdS space where the Randall-Sundrum brane-world is
embedded. We point out that the tachyonic scalar allowed in the bulk space
destabilizes the embedded brane-world where the cosmological constant is zero.
The resolution of this instability is discussed from the viewpoint of AdS/CFT
correspondence.
