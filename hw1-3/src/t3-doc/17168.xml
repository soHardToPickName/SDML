Mixed Branes at Angle in Compact Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article the interaction of branes at angles with respect to each
other with non-zero internal gauge fields are calculated by construction of the
boundary states in spacetime in which some of its directions are compact on
tori. The interaction depends on both angle and fields.
