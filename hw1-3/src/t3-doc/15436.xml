On Classical Rational $\cw$ Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of classical non-linear $\cw$ algebras closing on rational
functions is analyzed both for the ordinary and the supersymmetric case. Such
algebras appear as a result of a coset construction. Their relevance to
physical applications is pointed out.
