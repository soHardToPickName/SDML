Instantons Versus Supersymmetry: Fifteen Years Later
</title>

<abstract>
  An introduction to the instanton formalism in supersymmetric gauge theories
is given. We explain how the instanton calculations, in conjunction with
analyticity in chiral parameters and other general properties following from
supersymmetry, allow one to establish exact results in the weak and strong
coupling regimes. Some key applications are reviewed, the main emphasis is put
on the mechanisms of the dynamical breaking of supersymmetry.
