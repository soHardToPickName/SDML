<title>
Uniqueness of (dilatonic) charged black holes and black p-branes in
  higher dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the uniqueness of higher dimensional (dilatonic) charged black holes
in static and asymptotically flat spacetimes for arbitrary vector-dilaton
coupling constant. An application to the uniqueness of a wide class of black
p-branes is also given.
