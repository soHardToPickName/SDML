<title>
Orbifoldization, covering surfaces and uniformization theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The connection between the theory of permutation orbifolds, covering surfaces
and uniformization is investigated, and the higher genus partition functions of
an arbitrary permutation orbifold are expressed in terms of those of the
original theory.
