<title>
Gauge independent effective gauge fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of gauge independent definition of the effective gauge field is
considered. The Slavnov identities corresponding to a system of interacting
quantum gauge and classical matter fields, playing the role of a measuring
device, are obtained. With their help, in the case of power-counting
renormalizable theories, gauge independence of the effective device action is
proved in the low-energy limit, which allows to introduce the gauge independent
notion of the effective gauge field.
