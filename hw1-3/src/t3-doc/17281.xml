N = 2 Super $W_{\infty}$ Algebra and its Nonlinear Realization Through
  Super KP Formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonlinear realization of super $W_{\infty}$ algebra is shown to exist
through a consistent superLax formulation of super KP hierarchy. The reduction
of the superLax operator gives rise to the Lax operators for $N=2$ generalized
super KdV hierarchies, proposed by Inami and Kanno. The Lax equations are shown
to be Hamiltonian and the associated Poisson bracket algebra among the
superfields, consequently, gives rise to a realization of nonlinear super
$W_{\infty}$ algebra.
