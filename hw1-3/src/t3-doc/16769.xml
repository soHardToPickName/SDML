Does the Gursey-Tze Solution Represent a Monopole Condensate?
</title>

<abstract>
We recast the quaternionic Gursey-Tze solution, which is a fourfold
quasi-periodic self-dual Yang-Mills field with a unit instanton number per
Euclidean spacetime cell, into an ordinary coordinate formulation. After
performing the sum in the Euclidean time direction, we use an observation by
Rossi which suggests the solution represents an arrangement with a BPS monopole
per space lattice cell. This may provide a concrete realization of a monopole
condensate in pure Yang-Mills theory.
