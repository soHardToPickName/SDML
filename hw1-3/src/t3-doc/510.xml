<title>
Realistic regularization of the QED Green functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing the 't Hooft and Veltman method of unitary regulators, we
demonstrate for the first time the existence of local, Lorentz-invariant,
physically motivated Lagrangians of quantum-electrodynamic phenomena such that:
(i) Feynman diagrams are finite and equal the diagrams of QED but with
regularized propagators. (ii) N-point Green functions are C-, P-, and
T-invariant up to a phase factor, Lorentz-invariant and causal. (iii) No
auxiliary particles or parameters are introduced.
