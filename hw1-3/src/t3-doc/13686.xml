<title>
Does the radioactive decay obey the Poisson statistics?
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a nontrivial quantum structure of our space at macroscopic
scales, which may exist as a relic of quantum gravity processes in the early
universe, gives rise to a new phenomenon: spontaneous origin of an interference
picture in every physical process. This explains why statistical distributions
in radioactivity measurements may be different from the Poisson distribution.
