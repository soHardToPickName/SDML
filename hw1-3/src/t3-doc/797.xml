<title>
The Quantum Mechanics SUSY Algebra: An Introductory Review
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting with the Lagrangian formalism with N=2 supersymmetry in terms of two
Grassmann variables in Classical Mechanics, the Dirac canonical quantization
method is implemented. The N=2 supersymmetry algebra is associated to
one-component and two-component eigenfunctions considered in the Schr\"odinger
picture of Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics. Applications are contemplated.
