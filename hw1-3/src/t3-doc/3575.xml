Renormalization Group Flows on D3 branes at an Orbifolded Conifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider D3-branes at an orbifolded conifold whose horizon ${X_5}$
resolves into a smooth Einstein manifold which joins several copies of ${\bf
T}^{1,1}$. We describe in details the resolution of the singular horizon
${X_5}$ and describe different types of two-cycles appearing in the resolution.
For a large number of D3 branes, the AdS/CFT conjecture becomes a duality
between type IIB string theory on $AdS_5 \times {X_5} $ and the ${\cal N} = 1$
field theory living on the D3 branes. We study the fractional branes as small
perturbations of the string background and we reproduce the logarithmic flow of
field theory couplings by studying fluxes of NS-NS and R-R two forms through
different 2-cycles of the resolved horizon.
