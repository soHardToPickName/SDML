<title>
Deformed Heisenberg algebra and fractional spin field in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  With the help of the deformed Heisenberg algebra involving Klein operator, we
construct the minimal set of linear differential equations for the
(2+1)-dimensional relativistic field with arbitrary fractional spin, whose
value is defined by the deformation parameter.
