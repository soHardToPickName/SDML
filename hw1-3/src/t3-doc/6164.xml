<title>
Functional Differential Equations for the Free Energy and the Effective
  Energy in the Broken-Symmetry Phase of phi^4-Theory and Their Recursive
  Graphical Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  Extending recent work on QED and the symmetric phase of the euclidean
multicomponent scalar \phi^4-theory, we construct the vacuum diagrams of the
free energy and the effective energy in the ordered phase of \phi^4-theory. By
regarding them as functionals of the free correlation function and the
interaction vertices, we graphically solve nonlinear functional differential
equations, obtaining loop by loop all connected and one-particle irreducible
vacuum diagrams with their proper weights.
