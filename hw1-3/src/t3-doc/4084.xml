<title>
Distance dependent statistics in a P,T-invariant model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that in the P,T-invariant model with the mixed Chern-Simons term
the interaction of charge carriers leads to effective changing of their
statistics, which depends on distance between them. In particular, in the limit
of large distances fermions effectively turn into bosons.
