Dimensional Reduction via Noncommutative Spacetime: Bootstrap and
  Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  Unlike noncommutative space, when space and time are noncommutative, it seems
necessary to modify the usual scheme of quantum mechanics. We propose in this
paper a simple generalization of the time evolution equation in quantum
mechanics to incorporate the feature of a noncommutative spacetime. This
equation is much more constraining than the usual Schr\"odinger equation in
that the spatial dimension noncommuting with time is effectively reduced to a
point in low energy. We thus call the new evolution equation the spacetime
bootstrap equation, the dimensional reduction called for by this evolution
seems close to what is required by the holographic principle. We will discuss
several examples to demonstrate this point.
