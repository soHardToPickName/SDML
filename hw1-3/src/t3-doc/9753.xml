Quantum Affine Symmetry as Generalized Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum affine $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)}) $ symmetry is studied when $q^2$ is
an even root of unity. The structure of this algebra allows a natural
generalization of N=2 supersymmetry algebra. In particular it is found that the
momentum operators $P ,\bar{P}$, and thus the Hamiltonian, can be written as
generalized multi-commutators, and can be viewed as new central elements of the
algebra $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)})$. We show that massive particles in (deformations
of) integer spin representions of $sl(2)$ are not allowed in such theories.
Generalizations of Witten's index and Bogomolnyi bounds are presented and a
preliminary attempt in constructing manifestly $\CU_q (\hat{sl(2)})$ invariant
actions as generalized supersymmetric Landau-Ginzburg theories is made.
