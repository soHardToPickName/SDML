Seiberg-Witten Curves and Integrable Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  This talk gives an introduction into the subject of Seiberg-Witten curves and
their relation to integrable systems. We discuss some motivations and origins
of this relation and consider explicit construction of various families of
Seiberg-Witten curves in terms of corresponding integrable models.
