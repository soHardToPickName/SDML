<title>
Multi-scale Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  The Standard MS renormalization prescription is inadequate for dealing with
multi-scale problems. To illustrate this we consider the computation of the
effective potential in the Higgs-Yukawa model. It is argued that it is natural
to employ a two-scale renormalization group. We give a modified version of a
two-scale scheme introduced by Einhorn and Jones. In such schemes the beta
functions necessarily contain potentially large logarithms of the RG scale
ratios. For credible perturbation theory one must implement a large logarithms
resumation on the beta functions themselves. We show how the integrability
condition for the two RG equations allows one to perform this resummation.
