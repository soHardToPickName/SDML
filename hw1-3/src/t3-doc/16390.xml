<title>
Glueball Mass Spectra and Other Issues for Supergravity Duals of QCD
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive WKB expressions for glueball masses of various finite temperature
supergravity models. The results are very close to recent numerical
computations. We argue that the spectra has some universality that depends only
on the dimension of the AdS space and the singularity structure of the horizon.
This explains the stability of the $0^{++}$ glueball mass ratios between
various models. We also consider the recently proposed nonsupersymmetric model
arising from the type 0 string. In the supergravity limit of this model, the
heavy quark potential has an effective coupling with 1/(log u) behavior in the
UV. Unfortunately, the supergravity solution implies that the heavy quark
potential is still coulombic in the infrared, with an effective coupling of
order 1. We also argue that the type 0 supergravity background solution does
not have normalizable glueball solutions.
