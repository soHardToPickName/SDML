Intersecting branes from 7-manifolds with G_2 holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk I discuss intersecting brane configurations coming from explicit
metrics with G_2 holonomy. An example of a 7-manifold which representing a R^3
bundle over a self-dual Einstein space is described and the potential appearing
after compactification over the 6-d twistor space is derived.
