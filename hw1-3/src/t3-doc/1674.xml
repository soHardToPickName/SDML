<title>
The effect of different regulators in the non-local field-antifield
  quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it was shown how to regularize the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV)
field-antifield formalism of quantization of gauge theories with the non-local
regularization (NLR) method. The objective of this work is to make an analysis
of the behaviour of this NLR formalism, connected to the BV framework, using
two different regulators: a simple second order differential regulator and a
Fujikawa-like regulator. This analysis has been made in the light of the well
known fact that different regulators can generate different expressions for
anomalies that are related by a local couterterm, or that are equivalent after
a reparametrization. This has been done by computing precisely the anomaly of
the chiral Schwinger model.
