<title>
Stokes Theorem for Loop Variables of Non-Abelian Gauge Field
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple analytic proof of the formula known as the non-Abelian Stokes
theorem is given. It is explicitly shown that the consistency of the formula is
guaranteed by the Bianchi identity for the gauge field. An attempt is made to
construct the Lagrangian for the gauge field in terms of loop variables.
