<title>
Grand Unified Theories From Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  I review how traditional grand unified theories, which require adjoint (or
higher representation) Higgs fields for breaking to the standard model, can be
contained within string theory. The status (as of January 1996) of the search
for stringy free fermionic three generation SO(10) SUSY--GUT models is
discussed. Progress in free fermionic classification of both SO(10)$_2$ charged
and uncharged embeddings and in $N=1$ spacetime solutions is presented. Based
on talks presented at the Workshop on SUSY Phenomena and SUSY GUTs, Santa
Barbara, California, Dec. 7-11, 1995, and at the Orbis Scientiae, Coral Gables,
Florida, January 25-28, 1996. Appearing in the Proceedings of Orbis Scientiae,
1996.
