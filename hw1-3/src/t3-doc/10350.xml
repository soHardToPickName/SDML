A Note on Acceleration from Product Space Compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  We study compactifications of Einstein gravity on product spaces in vacuum
and their acceleration phases. Scalar potentials for the dimensionally reduced
effective theory are found to be of exponential form and exact solutions are
obtained for a class of product spaces. The inflation in our solutions is not
sufficient for the early universe. We comment on the possibility of obtaining
sufficient inflation by compactification in general.
