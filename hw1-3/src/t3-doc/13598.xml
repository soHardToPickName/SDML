<title>
Wormholes and symmetries of string effective action
</title>

<abstract>
  The dimensional reduction technique is adopted to derive string effective
action. Wormhole solutions corresponding to space-time geometries $R^1\times
S^1\times S^2$ and $R^1\times S^3$ are presented. The duality and SL(2,R)
symmetries are implemented to generate new wormhole solutions.
