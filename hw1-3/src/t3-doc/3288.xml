<title>
On the Bound States of Matrix Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate excitations in Matrix Theory on T^2 corresponding to bound
states of strings. We demonstrate the Dirichlet aspect of R-R charged vacua
through a non-trivial connection between the U(1) and SU(n) sectors of the
matrix SYM.
