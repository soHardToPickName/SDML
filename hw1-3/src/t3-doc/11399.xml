<title>
Classical Isomorphisms for Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  The expressions for the $\hat{R}$--matrices for the quantum groups
SO$_{q^2}$(5) and SO$_q$(6) in terms of the $\hat{R}$--matrices for Sp$_q$(2)
and SL$_q$(4) are found, and the local isomorphisms of the corresponding
quantum groups are established.
