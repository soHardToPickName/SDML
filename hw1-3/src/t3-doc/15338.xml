<title>
Solitons reduced from Heterotic fivebranes
</title>

<abstract>
  In view of the expectation that the solitonic sector of the lower dimensional
world may be originated from the solitonic sector of string theory, various
solitonic solutions are reduced from the heterotic fivebrane solutions in the
ten-dimensional heterotic string theory. These solitons in principle can appear
after proper compactifications, {\it e.g.} toroidal compactifications.
