<title>
Gap Condition and Self-Dualized ${\cal N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory for
  ADE Gauge Group on K3
</title>

<abstract>
  We try to determine the partition function of ${\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills
theoy for ADE gauge group on K3 by self-dualizing our previous ADE partition
function. The resulting partition function satisfies gap condition.
