<title>
Investigating Brane Resolution With Perturbative Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the transition between singular and non-singular geometries
from the vantage point of perturbative field dynamics. In particular, we obtain
the closed-form absorption probability for minimally-coupled massless scalars
propagating in the background of a heterotic 5-brane on a Taub-NUT instanton.
This is an exact calculation for arbitrary incident frequencies. For the
singular geometry, the absorption probability vanishes when the frequency is
below a certain threshold, and for the non-singular case it vanishes for all
frequencies. We discuss the connection between this phenomenon and the behavior
of geodesics in this background. We also obtain exact quasinormal modes.
