A Unified Approach to Solvable Models of Dilaton Gravity in
  Two-Dimensions Based on Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  A large class of solvable models of dilaton gravity in two space-time
dimensions, capable of describing black hole geometry, are analyzed in a
unified way as non-linear sigma models possessing a special symmetry. This
symmetry, which can be neatly formulated in the target-space-covariant manner,
allows one to decompose the non-linearly interacting dilaton-gravity system
into a free field and a field satisfying the Liouville equation with in general
non-vanishing cosmological term. In this formulation, all the existent models
are shown to fall into the category with vanishing cosmological constant.
General analysis of the space-time structureinduced by a matter shock wave is
performed and new models, with and without the cosmological term, are
discussed.
