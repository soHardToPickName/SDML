<title>
Generalized Mathai-Quillen Topological Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple field theoretical approach to Mathai-Quillen topological field
theories of maps $X: M_I \to M_T$ from an internal space to a target space is
presented. As an example of applications of our formalism we compute by
applying our formulas the action and Q-variations of the fields of two well
known topological systems: Topological Quantum Mechanics and type-A topological
Sigma Model.
