<title>
Non-commutativity, Zero modes and D-brane Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-commutative geometry is revisited from the perspective of a
generalized D p-brane. In particular, we analyze the open bosonic string
world-sheet description and show that an effective non-commutative description
on a D p-brane corresponds to a re-normalized world-volume. The world-volume
correlators are analyzed to make a note on the non-commutative geometry. It is
argued that the U(1) gauge symmetry can be viewed in a homomorphic image space
for the non-commutative space of coordinates with an SO(p) symmetry. In the
large B-field limit, the non-commutativity reduces to that among the zero modes
and the world-volume description is precisely in agreement with the holographic
principle.
