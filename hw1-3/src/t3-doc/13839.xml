<title>
ChroNodynamics or a quantum theory involving deviations from uniform run
  of time
</title>

<abstract>
  Let us imagine that there is an overall quantum theory (not necessarily
recognized yet) of matter and energy ({\it i.e.}, of elementary fermions and
bosons) interacting with the physical spacetime (treated on a quantum level).
Since states of quantum spacetime are so far not observed directly, they ought
to be projected out from the overall Hilbert space (much like states of a
quantum medium in the optical model often constructed in nuclear physics).
Then, in the reduced Hilbert space only states of quantum matter and energy are
left, but now endowed with the energy width that enters through an
antiHermitian interaction-like operator, a remainder of their coupling to the
quantum spacetime. We postulate that such an energy width involves an averaged
coupling of quantum matter and energy to a classical field of time deviations
from the uniform time run (in the classical spacetime of special relativity).
The well known time-temperature analogy helps us to fix other postulates
leading altogether to a quantum theory we call chronodynamics (a loose analogue
of thermodynamics of small deviations from thermal equilibrium).
