<title>
Superconformal Field Theory with Boundary:Spin Model
</title>

<abstract>
  GSO projected Superconformal field theory (Spin Model) with boundary is
considered. There were written the boundary states. For this model were derived
one-point structure constants and "bootstrap" equations for boundary-bulk
structure constants.
