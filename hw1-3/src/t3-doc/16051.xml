<title>
Supergravity Solutions for Localized Intersections of Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an explicit supergravity solution for a configuration of
localized D4-brane ending on a D6-brane, restricted to the near horizon region
of the latter. We generate this solution by dimensionally reducing the
supergravity solution for a flat M5-brane in $R^{1,7} \times C^2/Z_N$ with the
M5-brane partially embedded in $C^2/Z_N$. We describe the general class of
localized intersections and overlaps whose supergravity solutions are
constructible in this way.
