Quasi gravity in branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In contrast with pseudo-gravitational effects that are mathematically
analogous but physically quite distinct from gravity, this presentation deals
with a kind of quasi-gravitational effect that can act in an asymmetrically
moving brane worldsheet in a manner that approximates (and in a crude analysis
might be physically indistinguishable from) the effect that would arise from
genuine gravitation, of ordinary Newtonian type in non-relativistic
applications, and of scalar - tensor (Jordan - Brans - Dicke rather than pure
Einstein) type in relativistic applications.
