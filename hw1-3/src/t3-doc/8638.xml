<title>
Multiple reflection expansion and heat kernel coefficients
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose the multiple reflection expansion as a tool for the calculation of
heat kernel coefficients. As an example, we give the coefficients for a sphere
as a finite sum over reflections, obtaining as a byproduct a relation between
the coefficients for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. Further, we
calculate the heat kernel coefficients for the most general matching conditions
on the surface of a sphere, including those cases corresponding to the presence
of delta and delta prime background potentials. In the latter case, the
multiple reflection expansion is shown to be non-convergent.
