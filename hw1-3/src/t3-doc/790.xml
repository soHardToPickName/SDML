On third Poisson structure of KdV equation
</title>

<abstract>
The third Poisson structure of KdV equation in terms of canonical ``free
fields'' and reduced WZNW model is discussed. We prove that it is
``diagonalized'' in the Lagrange variables which were used before in
formulation of 2D gravity. We propose a quantum path integral for KdV
equation based on this representation.
