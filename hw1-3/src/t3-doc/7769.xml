<title>
On the generalized Legendre transform and monopole metrics
</title>

<abstract>
  In the generalized Legendre transform construction the Kaehler potential is
related to a particular function. Here, the form of this function appropriate
to the monopole metric is calculated from the known twistor theory of
monopoles.
