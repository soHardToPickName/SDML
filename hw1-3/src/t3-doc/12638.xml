Threshold amplitudes in field theories and integrable systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the threshold tree amplitudes in diverse nonintegrable quantum
field theories in the framework of integrability. The amplitudes are related to
some Baker functions defined on the auxiliary spectral curves and the
nullification phenomena are shown to allow a topological interpretation.
