Star-Product and Massless Free Field Dynamics in $AdS_4$
</title>

<abstract>
  Generic solution of free equations for massless fields of an arbitrary spin
in $AdS_4$ is built in terms of the star-product algebra with spinor generating
elements. A class of "plane wave" solutions is described explicitly.
