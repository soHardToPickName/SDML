Renormalization of Hamiltonians in the Light-Front Fock Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We outline an ultraviolet renormalization procedure for hamiltonians acting
in the light-front Fock space. The hamiltonians are defined and calculated
using creation and annihilation operators with no limitation of the space of
states. Both, the regularization of the initial hamiltonian and the definition
of the renormalized effective hamiltonians, preserve the light-front frame
kinematical symmetries. The general equations for the effective hamiltonians
are illustrated by second order calculations of the self-energy and
two-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. Infrared
singularities are regulated but not renormalized.
