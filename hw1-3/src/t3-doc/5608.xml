Holography and CFT on Generic Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper it is shown how the AdS/CFT correspondence extends to a more
general situation in which the first theory is defined on (d+1)-dimensional
manifold $\tilde M$ defined as the filling in of a compact d-dimensional
manifold M. The stability of the spectral correspondence mass/conformal-weight
under such geometry changes is also proven.
