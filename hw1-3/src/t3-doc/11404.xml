Gauge Consistent Wilson Renormalization Group II: Non-Abelian Case
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a wilsonian formulation of non-abelian gauge theories explicitly
consistent with axial gauge Ward identitities. The issues of unitarity and
dependence on the quantization direction are carefully investigated. A
wilsonian computation of the one-loop QCD beta function is performed.
