Summing one- and two-dimensional series related to the Euler series
</title>

<abstract>
  We present results for some infinite series appearing in Feynman diagram
calculations, many of which are similar to the Euler series. These include both
one-dimensional and two-dimensional series. Most of these series can be
expressed in terms of zeta(2), zeta(3), the Catalan constant G and Cl{2}(pi/3)
where Cl{2}(theta) is Clausen's function.
