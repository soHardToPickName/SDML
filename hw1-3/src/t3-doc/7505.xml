<title>
Anticommuting Integrals and Fermionic Field Theories for Two-Dimensional
  Ising Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the applications of the integral over anticommuting Grassmann
variables (nonquantum fermionic fields) to the analytic solutions and the
field-theoretical formulations for the 2D Ising models. The 2D Ising model
partition function $Q$ is presentable as the fermionic Gaussian integral. The
use of the spin-polynomial interpretation of the 2D Ising problem is stressed,
in particular. Starting with the spin-polynomial interpretation of the local
Boltzmann weights, the Gaussian integral for $Q$ appears in the universal form
for a variety of lattices, including the standard rectangular, triangular, and
hexagonal lattices, and with the minimal number of fermionic variables (two per
site). The analytic solutions for the correspondent 2D Ising models then follow
by passing to the momentum space on a lattice. The symmetries and the question
on the location of critical point have an interesting interpretation within
this spin-polynomial formulation of the problem. From the exact lattice theory
we then pass to the continuum-limit field-theoretical interpretation of the 2D
Ising models. The continuum theory captures all relevant features of the
original models near $T_c$. The continuum limit corresponds to the low-momentum
sector of the exact theory responsible for the critical-point singularities and
the large-distance behaviour of correlations. The resulting field theory is the
massive two-component Majorana theory, with mass vanishing at $T_c$. By
doubling of fermions in the Majorana representation, we obtain as well the 2D
Dirac field theory of charged fermions for 2D Ising models. The differences
between particular 2D Ising lattices are merely adsorbed, in the
field-theoretical formulation, in the definition of the effective mass.
