On the Beta Function for Anisotropic Current Interactions in 2D
</title>

<abstract>
  By making use of current-algebra Ward identities we study renormalization of
general anisotropic current-current interactions in 2D. We obtain a set of
algebraic conditions that ensure the renormalizability of the theory to all
orders. In a certain minimal prescription we compute the beta function to all
orders.
