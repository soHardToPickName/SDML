Hypermultiplets, domain walls and supersymmetric attractors
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish general properties of supersymmetric flow equations and of the
superpotential of five-dimensional N = 2 gauged supergravity coupled to vector
and hypermultiplets. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for BPS
domain walls and find a set of algebraic attractor equations for N = 2 critical
points.
 As an example we describe in detail the gauging of the universal
hypermultiplet and a vector multiplet. We study a two-parameter family of
superpotentials with supersymmetric AdS critical points and we find, in
particular, an N = 2 embedding for the UV-IR solution of Freedman, Gubser,
Pilch and Warner of the N = 8 theory. We comment on the relevance of these
results for brane world constructions.
