Large N limit of Calogero-Moser models and Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the large N limit of Calogero-Moser models for the classical
infinite families of simple Lie algebras A_N, B_N, C_N and D_N. We show that
the limit defines two different Conformal Field Theories with central charge
c>1. The value of c and the dimension of the primary field are dictated by the
underlying algebraic symmetries of the model.
