Mass, Action and Entropy of Taub-Bolt-dS Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply a recent proposal for defining conserved mass in asymptotically de
Sitter spacetimes to the class of Taub-Bolt-dS spacetimes. We compute the
action, entropy and conserved mass of these spacetimes, and find that in
certain instances the mass and entropy can exceed that of pure de Sitter
spacetime, in violation of recent suggestive conjectures to the contrary.
