Moving Mirror Model of Hawking Evaporation
</title>

<abstract>
  The moving mirror model is designed to extract essential features of the
black hole formation and the subsequent Hawking radiation by neglecting
complication due to a finite curvature. We extend this approach to dynamically
treat back reaction against the mirror motion due to Hawking radiation. It is
found that a unique model in two spacetime dimensions exists in which Hawking
radiation completely stops and the end point of evaporation contains a
disconnected remnant. When viewed from asymptotic observers at one side of the
spacetime, quantum mechanical correlation is recovered in the end. Although the
thermal stage accompanying short range correlation may last for an arbitrarily
long period, at a much longer time scale a long tail of non-thermal correlation
is clearly detected.
