<title>
Weyl Anomaly of 2D Dilaton-Scalar Gravity and Hermiticity of System
  Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  Weyl Anomaly in the dilaton-scalar system in 2 dimensional gravity is
examined. We take the heat-kernel regularization for the ultraviolet
divergences. Generally the Weyl anomaly is determined by the 2nd order
differential (elliptic) operator of the system and the definition of the
measure. We have the freedom of the operator choice caused by the arbitrariness
of total divergences (surface terms) in the action. We examine the Weyl anomaly
in connection with such points and the hermiticity of the operator.
