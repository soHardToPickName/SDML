<title>
On Fermion Masses, Gradient Flows and Potential in Supersymmetric
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In any low energy effective supergravity theory general formulae exist which
allow one to discuss fermion masses, the scalar potential and breaking of
symmetries in a model independent set up. A particular role in this discussion
is played by Killing vectors and Killing prepotentials. We outline these
relations in general and specify then in the context of N=1 and N=2
supergravities in four dimensions. Useful relations of gauged quaternionic
geometry underlying hypermultiplets dynamics are discussed.
