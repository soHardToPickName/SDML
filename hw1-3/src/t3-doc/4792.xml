Gauge Invariance and Duality in the Noncommutative Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the duality between the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons
theories in 2+1-dimensions survives when the space-time becomes noncommutative.
Existence of the Seiberg-Witten map is crucial in the present analysis. It
should be noted that the above models, being manifestly gauge variant and
invariant respectively, transform differently under the Seiberg-Witten map. We
also discuss this duality in the Stuckelberg formalism where the self-dual
model is elevated to a gauge theory. The "`master"' lagrangian approach has
been followed throughout.
