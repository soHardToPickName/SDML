<title>
Classical Integrability of Two Dimensional Non Linear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The conditions under which a general two-dimensional non-linear sigma model
is classically integrable are given. These requirements are found by demanding
that the equations of motion of the theory are expressible as a zero curvature
relation. Some new integrable two-dimensional sigma models are then presented.
