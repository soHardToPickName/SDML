Comment on fermion propagator in real-time quantum-field theory at
  finite temperature and density
</title>

<abstract>
  Two forms are available for the fermion propagator at finite temperature and
density. It is shown that, when one deals with a diquark-condensation-operator
inserted Green function in hot and dense QCD, the standard form of the quark
propagator does not work. On the other hand, another form of the quark
propagator does work.
