<title>
Superbrane Actions and Geometrical Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a generic structure of conventional (Nambu-Goto and
Dirac-Born-Infeld-like) worldvolume actions for the superbranes and show how it
is connected through a generalized action construction with a doubly
supersymmetric geometrical approach to the description of super-p-brane
dynamics as embedding world supersurfaces into target superspaces.
