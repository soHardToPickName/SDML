<title>
Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology and M-Theory as a Topological Quantum Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a Lagrangian density for M-Theory which is purely topological
using Gelfand-Fuchs cohomology. Next we calculate the partition function which
indeed gives topological invariants that can be expressed via the Ray-Singer
analytic torsion.
