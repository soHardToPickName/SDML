Dynamic dS/CFT correspondence using the brane cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the dynamic dS/CFT correspondence using the moving domain
wall(brane) approach in the brane cosmology. The bulk spacetimes are given by
the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) black hole and the topological-de Sitter
(TdS) solutions. We consider the embeddings of (Euclidean) moving domain walls
into the (Euclidean) de Sitter spaces. The TdS solution is better to describe
the static dS/CFT correspondence than the SdS black hole, while in the dynamic
dS/CFT correspondence the SdS solution provides situation better than that of
the TdS solution. However, we do not find a desirable cosmological scenario
from the SdS black hole space.
