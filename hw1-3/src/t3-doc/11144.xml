<title>
The Exponential Map for the Conformal Group 0(2,4)
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general method to obtain a closed, finite formula for the
exponential map from the Lie algebra to the Lie group, for the defining
representation of the orthogonal groups. Our method is based on the
Hamilton-Cayley theorem and some special properties of the generators of the
orthogonal group, and is also independent of the metric. We present an explicit
formula for the exponential of generators of the $SO_+(p,q)$ groups, with $p+q
= 6$, in particular we are dealing with the conformal group $SO_+(2,4)$, which
is homomorphic to the $SU(2,2)$ group. This result is needed in the
generalization of U(1) gauge transformations to spin gauge transformations,
where the exponential plays an essential role. We also present some new
expressions for the coefficients of the secular equation of a matrix.
