<title>
Effective action in spherical domains
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action on an orbifolded sphere is computed for minimally
coupled scalar fields. The results are presented in terms of derivatives of
Barnes zeta-functions and it is shown how these may be evaluated. Numerical
values are shown. An analytical, heat-kernel derivation of the Ces\`aro-Fedorov
formula for the number of symmetry planes of a regular solid is also presented.
