On Non-Linear W-Infinity Symmetry of Generalized Liouville and Conformal
  Toda Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Invariance under non-linear ${\sf {\hat W}}_{\infty}$ algebra is shown for
the two-boson Liouville type of model and its algebraic generalizations, the
extended conformal Toda models. The realization of the corresponding generators
in terms of two boson currents within KP hierarchy is presented.
