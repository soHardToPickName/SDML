<title>
Conformal gauge fixing and Faddeev-Popov determinant in 2-dimensional
  Regge gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  By regularizing the conical singularities by means of a segment of a sphere
or pseudosphere and then taking the regulator to zero, we compute exactly the
Faddeev--Popov determinant related to the conformal gauge fixing for a
piece-wise flat surface with the topology of the sphere. The result is analytic
in the opening angles of the conical singularities in the interval ($\pi$,
$4\pi$) and in the smooth limit goes over to the continuum expression. The
Riemann-Roch relation on the dimensions of ker$(L^{\dag}L)$ and
ker$(LL^{\dag})$ is satisfied.
