On AdS3 String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory on curved backgrounds has received much attention on account of
both its own interest, and of its relation with gauge theories. Despite the
progress made in various directions, several quite elementary questions remain
unanswered, in particular in the very simple case of three-dimensional anti-de
Sitter space. I briefly review these problems.
