<title>
Alternative dimensional reduction via the density matrix: A test
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive and analyze the perturbation series for the classical effective
action in quantum statistical mechanics, treated as a toy model for the
dimensionally reduced effective action in quantum field theory at finite
temperature. The first few terms of the series are computed for the harmonic
oscillator and the quartic potential.
