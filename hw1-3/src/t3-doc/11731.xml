<title>
The Majorana particles and the Majorana sea
</title>

<abstract>
  Can one make a Majorana field theory for fermions starting from the zero mass
Weyl theory, then adding a mass term as an interaction? The answer to this
question is: yes we can. We can proceed similarly to the case of the Dirac
massive field theory. In both cases one can start from the zero mass Weyl
theory and then add a mass term as an interacting term of massless particles
with a constant (external) field. In both cases the interaction gives rise to a
field theory for a free massive fermion field. We present the procedure for the
creation of a mass term in the case of the Dirac and the Majorana field and we
look for a massive field as a superposition of massless fields.
