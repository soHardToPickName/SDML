Dimensionless Coupling of Superstrings to Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
  and Scale Invariant Superstring Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new superstring actions which are distinguished from standard
superstrings by being space-time scale invariant. Like standard superstrings,
they are also reparametrization invariant, space-time supersymmetric, and
invariant under local scale transformations of the world sheet. We discuss
scenarios in which these actions could play a significant role, in particular
one which involves their coupling to supersymmetric gauge theories.
