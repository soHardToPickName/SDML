<title>
The Topology of the AdS/CFT/Randall-Sundrum Complementarity
</title>

<abstract>
  The background geometries of the AdS/CFT and the Randall-Sundrum theories are
locally similar, and there is strong evidence for some kind of
"complementarity" between them; yet the global structures of the respective
manifolds are very different. We show that this apparent problem can be
understood in the context of a more complete global formulation of AdS/CFT. In
this picture, the brane-world arises within the AdS/CFT geometry as the
inevitable consequence of recent results on the global structure of manifolds
with "infinities". We argue that the usual coordinates give a misleading
picture of this global structure, much as Schwarzschild coordinates conceal the
global form of Kruskal-Szekeres space.
