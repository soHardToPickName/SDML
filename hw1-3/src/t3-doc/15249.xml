D-Branes and Quotient Singularities of Calabi-Yau Fourfolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a (0,2) gauge theory realized on the world volume of the type
IIB D1-brane at the singular point of a Calabi-Yau fourfold. It is argued that
the gauge anomaly can be canceled via coupling to the R-R chiral bosons in bulk
IIB string. We find that for a generic choice of the Fayet-Iliopoulos
parameters on the world volume, the Higgs moduli space is a smooth fourfold
birational to the original Calabi-Yau fourfold, but is not necessarily a
Calabi-Yau manifold.
