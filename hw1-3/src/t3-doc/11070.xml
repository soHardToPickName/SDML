Discussing the Spectrum of the Kalb-Ramond Field Coupled to 3D-Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The mechanism of dynamical mass generation for the gauge field is studied
through 1-loop. We find out that torsion is an obstruction to the appearance of
a 1-loop mass correction. Contrary, if torsion is not present, a mass gap is
generated for the 2-form field.
