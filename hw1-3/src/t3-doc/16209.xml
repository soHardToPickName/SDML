<title>
Light-cone formulation and spin spectrum of non-critical fermionic
  string
</title>

<abstract>
  A free fermionic string quantum model is constructed directly in the
light-cone variables in the range of dimensions $1<d<10$. It is shown that
after the GSO projection this model is equivalent to the fermionic massive
string and to the non-critical Rammond-Neveu-Schwarz string. The spin spectrum
of the model is analysed. For $d=4$ the character generating functions is
obtained and the particle content of first few levels is numerically
calculated.
