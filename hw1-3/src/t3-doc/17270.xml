Low-Temperature Thermodynamics of $A^{(2)}_2$ and su(3)-invariant Spin
  Chains
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations for the closed
(periodic boundary conditions) $A^{(2)}_2$ quantum spin chain in an external
magnetic field, in the (noncritical) regime where the anisotropy parameter
$\eta$ is real. In the limit $\eta \to 0$, we recover the TBA equations of the
antiferromagnetic su(3)-invariant chain in the fundamental representation. We
solve these equations for low temperature and small field, and calculate the
specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.
