Real-time thermal field theory analyses of 2D Gross-Neveu model
</title>

<abstract>
  Discrete symmetry breaking and possible restoration at finite temperature $T$
are analysed in 2D Gross-Neveu model by the real-time thermal field theory in
the fermion bubble approximation. The dynamical fermion mass $m$ is proven to
be scale-independent and this fact indicates the equivalence between the
fermion bubble diagram approximation and the mean field approximation used in
the auxialiary scalar field approach. Reproducing of the non-zero critical
temperature $T_c=0.567 m(0)$, ($m(0)$ is the dynamical fermion mass at T=0),
shows the equivalence between the real-time and the imaginary-time thermal
field theory in this problem. However, in the real-time formalism, more results
including absence of scalar bound state, the equation of criticality curve of
chemical potential-temperature and the $\ln(T_c/T)$ behavior of $m^2$ at
$T\stackrel{<}{\sim} T_c$ can be easily obtained. The last one indicates the
second-order phase transition feature of the symmetry restoration.
