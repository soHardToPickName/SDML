Superalgebra and Conservative Quantities in N=1 Self-dual Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=1 self-dual supergravity has SL(2,C) and the left-handed and right
-handed local supersymmetries. These symmetries result in SU(2) charges as the
angular-momentum and the supercharges. The model possesses also the invariance
under the general translation transforms and this invariance leads to the
energy-momentum. All the definitions are generally covariant . As the SU(2)
charges and the energy-momentum we obtained previously constituting the
3-Poincare algebra in the Ashtekar's complex gravity, the SU(2) charges, the
supercharges and the energy-momentum here also restore the super-Poincare
algebra, and this serves to support the reasonableness of their
interpretations.
