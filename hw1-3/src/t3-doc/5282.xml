<title>
The supergravity dual of a theory with dynamical supersymmetry breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the large $N$ limit of a little string theory that reduces in the IR
to U(N) ${\cal N} =1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills with Chern Simons coupling $k$.
Witten has shown that this field theory preserves supersymmetry if $k\geq N/2$
and he conjectured that it breaks supersymmetry if $k< N/2$. We find a
non-singular solution that describes the $k=N/2$ case, which is confining. We
argue that increasing $k$ corresponds to adding branes to this solution, in a
way that preserves supersymmetry, while decreasing $k$ corresponds to adding
anti-branes, and therefore breaking supersymmetry.
