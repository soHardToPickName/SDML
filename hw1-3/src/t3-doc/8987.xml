Higher Gel'fand-Dikii structures
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the procedure of Magri and Weinstein to produce an infinity of
compatible Poisson structures on a bihamiltonian manifold, to the case of the
KdV phase space. The higher Gel'fand-Dikii structures thus obtained contain non
local terms, which we express with the help of the r.h.s. of the KdV hierarchy.
We also give a generating function for all these Poisson structues, in terms of
the Baker-Akhiezer functions. Finally we describe the symplectic leaves of
these Poisson structures.
