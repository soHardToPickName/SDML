Perturbative Approach to Higher Derivative and Nonlocal Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review a perturbative approach to deal with Lagrangians with higher or
infinite order time derivatives. It enables us to construct a consistent
Poisson structure and Hamiltonian with only first time derivatives order by
order in coupling. To the lowest order, the Hamiltonian is bounded from below
whenever the potential is. We consider spacetime noncommutative field theory as
an example.
