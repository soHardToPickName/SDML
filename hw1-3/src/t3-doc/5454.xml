Tachyon Field Quantization and Hawking Radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the tachyon field in a static two dimensional dilaton gravity
black hole background,and we calculate the Hawking radiation rate. We find that
the thermal radiation flux, due to the tachyon field, is larger than the
conformal matter one. We also find that massive scalar fields which do not
couple to the dilaton, do not give any contribution to the thermal radiation,
up to terms quadratic in the scalar curvature.
