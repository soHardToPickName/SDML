<title>
Short harmonic superfields and light-cone gauge in super-Yang-Mills
  equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the superfield equations of the 4-dimensional N=2 and N=4
SYM-theories using light-cone gauge conditions and the harmonic-superspace
approach. The harmonic superfield equations of motion are drastically
simplified in this gauge, in particular, the basic harmonic-superfield matrices
and the corresponding harmonic analytic gauge connections become nilpotent
on-shell.
