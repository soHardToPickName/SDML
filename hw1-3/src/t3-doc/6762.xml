Algebraic versus Topologic Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the frame of a Group Approach to Quantization anomalies arise in a
quite natural way. We present in this talk an analysis of the basic
obstructions that can be found when we try to translate symmetries of the
Newton equations to the Quantum Theory. They fall into two classes: algebraic
and topologic according to the local or global character of the obstruction. We
present here one explicit example of each.
