Domain Wall World(s)
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational properties of domain walls in fundamental theory and their
implications for the trapping of gravity are reviewed. In particular, the
difficulties to embed gravity trapping configurations within gauged
supergravity is reviewed and the status of the domain walls obtained via the
breathing mode of sphere reduced Type IIB supergravity is presented.
