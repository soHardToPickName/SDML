Covariant - tensor method for quantum groups and applications I:
  $SU(2)_{q}$
</title>

<abstract>
  A covariant - tensor method for $SU(2)_{q}$ is described. This tensor method
is used to calculate q - deformed Clebsch - Gordan coefficients. The connection
with covariant oscillators and irreducible tensor operators is established.
This approach can be extended to other quantum groups.
