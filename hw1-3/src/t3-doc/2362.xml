Untwisted Moduli and Internal Fermions in Free Fermionic Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the dependence of the number and type of untwisted moduli on
the boundary condition vectors of relistic free fermionic strings. The number
of moduli is given by six minus the number of complex internal world--sheet
fermions and the type of moduli is determined by the details of the
world--sheet left--right asymmetry of the boundary conditions for the internal
fermions. We give a geometrical description of our results in terms of the
transformations of the compactified dimensions of $Z_2 \times Z_2$ orbifolds.
We investigate all possible boundary conditions for the internal fermions and
prove our results in general by showing that world--sheet supersymmetry
eliminates those boundary conditions which violate our results.
