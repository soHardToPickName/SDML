Axial Monopoles, Quantization of Electric Charge and Dynamical
  Discreteness of Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present contribution we show that the introduction of axial currents
in electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric charge and
introduces a dynamical discreteness of space-time, justifying thus the
regularization of Feymman's integrals.
