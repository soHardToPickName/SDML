<title>
Bridging the Dimensional Gap: from Kink in One Dimension to Curved
  Domain Wall in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Improved expansion in width is applied to a curved domain wall in
nonrelativistic dissipative $\lambda(\Phi^2 - v^2)^2 $ model with real scalar
order parameter $\Phi$. Approximate analytic description of such a domain wall
to second order in the width is presented.
