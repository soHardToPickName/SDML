<title>
On zero modes of the eleven dimensional superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that recently pointed out by Berkovits on-shell degrees of
freedom of the D=11 superstring do not make contributions into the quantum
states spectrum of the theory. As a consequence, the spectrum coincides with
that of the D=10 type IIA superstring.
