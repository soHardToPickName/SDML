<title>
Local Fractional Supersymmetry for Alternative Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  A group theory justification of one dimensional fractional supersymmetry is
proposed using an analogue of a coset space, just like the one introduced in
$1D$ supersymmetry. This theory is then gauged to obtain a local fractional
supersymmetry {\it i.e.} a fractional supergravity which is then quantized {\it
\`a la Dirac} to obtain an equation of motion for a particle which is in a
representation of the braid group and should describe alternative statistics. A
formulation invariant under general reparametrization is given, by means of a
curved fractional superline.
