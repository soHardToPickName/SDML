A braided Yang-Baxter Algebra in a Theory of two coupled Lattice Quantum
  KdV: algebraic properties and ABA representations
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the Yang-Baxter algebra is found in quantizing the
monodromy matrix of two (m)KdV equations discretized on a space lattice. This
braided Yang-Baxter equation still ensures that the transfer matrix generates
operators in involution which form the Cartan sub-algebra of the braided
quantum group. Representations diagonalizing these operators are described
through relying on an easy generalization of Algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques.
The conjecture that this monodromy matrix algebra leads, {\it in the cylinder
continuum limit}, to a Perturbed Minimal Conformal Field Theory description is
analysed and supported.
