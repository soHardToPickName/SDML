Notes from the Underground: A Propos of Givental's Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  These brief notes record our puzzles and findings surrounding Givental's
recent conjecture which expresses higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants in
terms of the genus-0 data. We limit our considerations to the case of a
projective line, whose Gromov-Witten invariants are well-known and easy to
compute. We make some simple checks supporting his conjecture.
