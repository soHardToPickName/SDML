Understanding flavor mixing in Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on recent results showing that a rich non-perturbative vacuum
structure is associated with flavor mixing in Quantum Field Theory.
  We treat explicitly the case of mixing among three generations of Dirac
fermions.
  Exact oscillation formulas are presented exhibiting new features with respect
to the usual ones. CP and T violation are also discussed.
