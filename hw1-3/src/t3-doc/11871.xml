Costituent Quark Picture out of QCD in two dimensions - on the
  Light-Cone
</title>

<abstract>
  Using DLCQ as a nonperturbative method, we test Fock-space truncations in
${\rm QCD}_{1+1}$ by studying the mass spectra of hadrons in colour SU(2) and
SU(3) at finite harmonic resolution $K$. We include $q\bar q q\bar q$ states
for mesons and up to $qqq q\bar q$ states for baryons. With this truncation, we
give `predictions' for the masses of the first five states where finite $K$
effects are minimal.
