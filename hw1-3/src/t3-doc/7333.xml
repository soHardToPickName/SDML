Orientifold planes, affine algebras and magnetic monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze string theory backgrounds that include different kinds of
orientifold planes and map out a natural correspondence to (twisted) affine
Kac-Moody algebras. The low-energy description of specific BPS states in these
backgrounds leads to a construction of explicit twisted magnetic monopole
solutions on R^3 x S^1. These backgrounds yield new low-energy field theories
with twisted boundary conditions and the link with affine algebras yields a
natural guess for the superpotentials of the corresponding pure N=1, and N=1*
gauge theories.
