<title>
Three-dimensional topological quantum field theory of Witten type
</title>

<abstract>
  Description of two three-dimensional topological quantum field theories of
Witten type as twisted supersymmetric theories is presented. Low-energy
effective action and a corresponding topological invariant of three-dimensional
manifolds are considered.
