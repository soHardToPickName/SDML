Vacuum polarization in thermal QED with an external magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop vacuum polarization tensor is computed in QED with an external
constant, homogeneous magnetic field at finite temperature. The Schwinger
proper-time formalism is used and the computations are done in Euclidian space.
The well-known results are recovered when the temperature and/or the magnetic
field are switched off and the effect of the magnetic field on the Debye
screening is discussed.
