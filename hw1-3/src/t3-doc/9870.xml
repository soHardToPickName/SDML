<title>
BRST quantization of gauge theories like SL(2,R) on inner product spaces
</title>

<abstract>
Some general formulas are derived for the solutions of a BRST quantization on
inner product spaces of finite dimensional bosonic gauge theories invariant
under arbitrary Lie groups. A detailed analysis is then performed of SL(2,R)
invariant models and some possible geometries of the Lagrange multipliers are
derived together with explicit results for a class of SL(2,R) models. Gauge
models invariant under a nonunimodular gauge group are also studied in some
detail.
