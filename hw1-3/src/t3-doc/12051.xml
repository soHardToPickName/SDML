BPS kinks in the Gross-Neveu model
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the exact spectrum and degeneracies for the Gross-Neveu model in two
dimensions. This model describes N interacting Majorana fermions; it is
asymptotically free, and has dynamical mass generation and spontaneous chiral
symmetry breaking. We show here that the spectrum contains 2^{N/2} kinks for
any $N$. The unusual \sqrt{2} in the number of kinks for odd $N$ comes from
restrictions on the allowed multi-kink states. These kinks are the BPS states
for a generalized supersymmetry where the conserved current is of dimension
N/2; the N=3 case is the {\cal N}=1 supersymmetric sine-Gordon model, for which
the spectrum consists of 2\sqrt{2} kinks. We find the exact S matrix for these
kinks, and the exact free energy for the model.
