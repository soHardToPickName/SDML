Loop Equation in Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  The incompressible fluid dynamics is reformulated as dynamics of closed loops
$C$ in coordinate space. This formulation allows to derive explicit functional
equation for the generating functional $\Psi[C]$ in inertial range of spatial
scales, which allows the scaling solutions. The requirement of finite energy
dissipation rate leads then to the Kolmogorov index. We find an exact steady
solution of the loop equation in inertial range of the loop sizes. The
generating functional decreases as $\EXP{-A^{\tt}}$ where $A=\oint_C r \wedge
dr$ is the area inside the loop. The pdf for the velocity circulation $\Gamma$
is Lorentzian, with the width $\bar{\Gamma} \propto A^{\tt} $.
