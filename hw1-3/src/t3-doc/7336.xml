Some New Non-Abelian 2D Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from certain 3D non-abelian dual systems, we discuss a number of
related dual systems in 2D, some of which are obtained by dimensional
reduction. The dualities relate massive scalar and vector fields, and may be
relevant for string theory in the context of massive type IIA supergravity.
Supersymmetric extensions of the models are also presented.
