<title>
Mixed (open/closed) N=(2,2) string theory as an integrable deformation
  of self-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The exact effective field equations of motion, corresponding to the
perturbative mixed theory of open and closed (2,2) world-sheet supersymmetric
strings, are investigated. It is shown that they are only integrable in the
case of an abelian gauge group. The gravitational equations are then stationary
with respect to the Born-Infeld-type effective action.
