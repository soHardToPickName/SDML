Non-extremal Localised Branes and Vacuum Solutions in M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-extremal overlapping p-brane supergravity solutions localised in their
relative transverse coordinates are constructed. The construction uses an
algebraic method of solving the bosonic equations of motion. It is shown that
these non-extremal solutions can be obtained from the extremal solutions by
means of the superposition of two deformation functions defined by vacuum
solutions of M-theory. Vacuum solutions of M-theory including irrational powers
of harmonic functions are discussed.
