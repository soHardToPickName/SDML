A Positive Energy Theorem for Asymptotically deSitter Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a set of conserved charges for asymptotically deSitter
spacetimes that correspond to asymptotic conformal isometries. The charges are
given by boundary integrals at spatial infinity in the flat cosmological
slicing of deSitter. Using a spinor construction, we show that the charge
associated with conformal time translations is necessarilly positive and hence
may provide a useful definition of energy for these spacetimes. A similar
spinor construction shows that the charge associated with the time translation
Killing vector of deSitter in static coordinates has both positive and negative
definite contributions. For Schwarzshild-deSitter the conformal energy we
define is given by the mass parameter times the cosmological scale factor. The
time dependence of the charge is a consequence of a non-zero flux of the
corresponding conserved current at spatial infinity. For small perturbations of
deSitter, the charge is given by the total comoving mass density.
