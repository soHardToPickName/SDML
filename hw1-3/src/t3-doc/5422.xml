<title>
A Possible IIB Superstring Matrix Model with Euler Characteristic and a
  Double Scaling Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a recently proposed Yang-Mills matrix model with an auxiliary
field, which is a candidate for a non-perturbative description of type IIB
superstrings, captures the Euler characteristic of moduli space of Riemann
surfaces. This happens at the saddle point for the Yang-Mills field. It turns
out that the large-n limit in this matrix model corresponds to a double scaling
limit in the Penner model.
