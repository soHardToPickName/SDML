<title>
Review of Non-Commutative Geometric Methods Applied to Particle Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a brief review where some basic elements of non-commutative geometry
are given. The rules and ingredients that enter in the construction of the
standard model and grand unification models in non-commutative geometry are
summarized. A connection between some space-time supersymmetric models and
non-commutative geometry is made. The advantages and problems of this direction
are discussed.
