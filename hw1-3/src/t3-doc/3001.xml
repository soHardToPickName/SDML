<title>
The Wess-Zumino-Witten term in non-commutative two-dimensional fermion
  models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effective action associated to the Dirac operator in two
dimensional non-commutative Field Theory. Starting from the axial anomaly, we
compute the determinant of the Dirac operator and we find that even in the U(1)
theory, a Wess-Zumino-Witten like term arises.
