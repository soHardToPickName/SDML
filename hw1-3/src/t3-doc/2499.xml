<title>
Cohomology and Topological Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  The chiral anomaly can be considered as an object defined either on the space
of gauge potentials or on the orbit space. We will discuss the relation between
the two descriptions. We will also relate to the cohomology of the group of
gauge transformations.
