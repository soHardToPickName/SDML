Variations on stability
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the effects of non-abelian dynamics of D-branes on their stability
and introduce Hitchin-like modifications to previously-known stability
conditions. The relation to brane-antibrane systems is used in order to rewrite
the equations in terms of superconnections and arrive at deformed vortex
equations.
