<title>
Supersymmetric and Kappa-invariant Coincident D0-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generic supersymmetric and kappa-invariant action for describing
coincident D0-branes with non-abelian matter fields on their worldline. The
action is shown to be in agreement with the Matrix Theory limit of the
ND0-brane effective action.
