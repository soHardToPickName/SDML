<title>
Color Confinement in QCD due to Topological Defects
</title>

<abstract>
  We outline a derivation of area law of the Wilson loop in SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory in the maximal Abelian gauge. This is based on a new version of
non-Abelian Stokes theorem and the novel reformulation of the Yang-Mills
theory. Abelian dominance and monopole dominance of the string tension in SU(N)
QCD are immediate consequences of this derivation.
