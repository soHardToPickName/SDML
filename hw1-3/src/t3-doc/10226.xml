<title>
U(1) lattice gauge theory and N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the physics of four-dimensional compact U(1) lattice gauge theory
from the point of view of softly broken N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) Yang-Mills
theory. We provide arguments in favor of (pseudo-)critical mass exponents 1/3,
5/11 and 1/2, in agreement with the values observed in the computer
simulations. We also show that the J^{CP} assignment of some of the lowest
lying states can be naturally explained.
