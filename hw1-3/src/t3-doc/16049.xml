Connectedness Of The Boundary In The AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  Let $M$ be a complete Einstein manifold of negative curvature, and assume
that (as in the AdS/CFT correspondence) it has a Penrose compactification with
a conformal boundary $N$ of positive scalar curvature. We show that under these
conditions, $H_n(M;Z)=0$ and in particular $N$ must be connected. These results
resolve some puzzles concerning the AdS/CFT correspondence.
