<title>
The Kink variety in systems of two coupled scalar fields in two
  space-time dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we describe the moduli space of kinks in a class of systems of
two coupled real scalar fields in (1+1) Minkowskian space-time. The main
feature of the class is the spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry of
(real) Ginzburg-Landau type that guarantees the existence of kink topological
defects.
