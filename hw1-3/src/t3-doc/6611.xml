Comment on "Dynamical Chern-Simons term generation at finite density"
  and "Chern-Simons term at finite density"
</title>

<abstract>
  We comment on the calculation of the Chern-Simons coefficient in
(2+1)-dimensional gauge theories at finite chemical potential made by
A.N.Sissakian, O.Yu.Shevchenko and S.B.Solganik (hep-th/9608159 and
hep-th/9612140).
