Triple Products and Yang-Baxter Equation (II): Orthogonal and Symplectic
  Ternary Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the result of the preceeding paper and solve the Yang-Baxter
equation in terms of triple systems called orthogonal and symplectic ternary
systems. In this way, we found several other new solutions.
