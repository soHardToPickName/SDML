Quantum Canonical Transformations: Physical Equivalence of Quantum
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Two quantum theories are physically equivalent if they are related, not by a
unitary transformation, but by an isometric transformation. The conditions
under which a quantum canonical transformation is an isometric transformation
are given.
