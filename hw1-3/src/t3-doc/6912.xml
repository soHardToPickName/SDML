<title>
Integrability and Seiberg-Witten Theory: Curves and Periods
</title>

<abstract>
  Interpretation of exact results on the low-energy limit of $4d$ $N=2$ SUSY YM
in the language of $1d$ integrability theory is reviewed. The case of elliptic
Calogero system, associated with the flow between $N=4$ and $N=2$ SUSY in $4d$,
is considered in some detail.
