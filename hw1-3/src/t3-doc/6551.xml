<title>
Dynamical emergence of extra dimensions and warped geometries
</title>

<abstract>
  We present four-dimensional gauge theories in Minkowski spacetime which
effectively generate in certain energy regimes five-dimensional warped
geometries whereas, in general, the fifth dimension is latticized. After
discussing in detail several general aspects in such theories we present a
number of exactly solvable examples. We also point out how a particular case,
defined in an N-sided polygon and having a Z_N symmetry, has a similar
realization in an appropriate supersymmetric setting with D3-branes.
