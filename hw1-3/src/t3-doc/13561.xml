Finite Temperature Effective Action in Monopole Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the CP-odd part of the finite temperature effective action for
massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a Dirac monopole. We confirm that the
induced charge is temperature dependent, and in the effective action we find an
infinite series of CP-violating terms that generalize the familiar zero
temperature $F\tilde{F}$ term. These results are analogous to recent results
concerning finite temperature induced Chern-Simons terms.
