Quantum Cosmology with Yang-Mills Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine an extension of the ideas of quantum cosmology and, in particular,
the proposal of Hartle and Hawking for the boundary conditions of the Universe,
to models which incorporate Yang-Mills fields. Inhomogeneous perturbations
about a homogeneous, isotropic minisuperspace background model are considered,
by expanding the Yang-Mills fields in harmonics of the spatial directions which
are taken to be three-spheres. The expansions are made explicit for $SO(N)$
gauge fields thereby obtaining formulae compatible with the formalism
conventionally used in quantum cosmology. We apply these results to the gauge
group $SO(3)$ and derive the Lagrangian and the semi-classical wave function
for this special case.
