T-Duality Can Fail
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that T-duality can be broken by nonperturbative effects in string
coupling. The T-duality in question is that of the 2-torus when the heterotic
string is compactified on K3 x T2. This case is compared carefully to a
situation where T-duality appears to work. A holonomy argument is presented to
show that T-dualities (and general U-dualities) should only be expected for
large amounts of supersymmetry. This breaking of R <-> 1/R symmetry raises some
interesting questions in string theory which we discuss. Finally we discuss how
the classical modular group of a 2-torus appears to be broken too.
