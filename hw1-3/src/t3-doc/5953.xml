Uniqueness of D=11 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the extent to which D=11 supergravity can be deformed and show in
two very different ways that, unlike lower D versions, it forbids an extension
with cosmological constant. Some speculations about other invariants are made,
in connection with the possible counterterms of the theory.
