Connes' Gauge Theory on Noncommutative Space-Times
</title>

<abstract>
  Connes' gauge theory is defined on noncommutative space-times. It is applied
to formulate a noncommutative Glashow-Weinberg-Salam (GWS) model in the
leptonic sector. It is shown that the model has two Higgs doublets and the
gauge bosons sector after the Higgs mechanism contains the massive charged
gauge fields, two massless and two massive neutral gauge fields. It is also
shown that, in the tree level, the neutrino couples to one of two `photons',
the electron interacts with both `photons' and there occurs a nontrivial
$\nu_R$-interaction on noncommutative space-times. Our noncommutative GWS model
is reduced to the GWS theory in the commutative limit. Thus in the neutral
gauge bosons sector there are only one massless photon and only one $Z^0$ in
the commutative limit.
