<title>
Magnetic monopole solutions with a massive dilaton
</title>

<abstract>
  Static, spherically symmetric monopole solutions of a spontaneously broken
SU(2) gauge theory coupled to a massive dilaton field are studied in detail in
function of the dilaton coupling strength and of the dilaton mass.
