<title>
Composite p-branes on Product of Einstein Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  A multidimensional gravitational model with several scalar fields, fields of
forms and cosmological constant is considered. When scalar fields are constant
and composite p-brane monopole-like ansatz for the fields of forms is adopted,
a wide class of solutions on product of n+1 Einstein spaces is obtained. These
solutions are the composite p-brane generalizations of the Freund-Rubin
solution. Some examples including the AdS_m x S^k x... solutions are
considered.
