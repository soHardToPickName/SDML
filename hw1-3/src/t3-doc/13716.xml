<title>
Non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm Scattering of Spin 1/2 Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the low energy regime of the scattering of two fermionic particles
carrying isospin 1/2 and interacting through a non-Abelian Chern-Simons field.
We calculate the one-loop scattering amplitude for both the nonrelativistic and
also for the relativistic theory. In the relativistic case we introduce an
intermediate cutoff, separating the regions with low and high loop momenta
integration. In this procedure purely relativistic field theory effects as the
vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment corrections are automatically
incorporated.
