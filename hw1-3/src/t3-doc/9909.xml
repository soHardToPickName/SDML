<title>
Trefoil knot and ad-hoc classification of elementary fields in the
  Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an arbitrary model based on the trefoil knot to construct objects
of the same spectrum as that of elementary particles. It includes `waves' and
three identical sets of sources. Due to Lorentz invariance, `waves' group into
3 types of 1, 3 and 8 objects and `sources' consists of 3 identical sets of
30+2 elements, which separate into: 1 * 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 * 2 + 3 * 2 * 2 + 3 * 1 *
2 + 3 * 1 * 2 and another 1 * 1 * 2 group (which does not match classification
of the Standard Model fields). On the other hand, there is no room in this
construction for objects directly corresponding to Higgs-like degrees of
freedom.
