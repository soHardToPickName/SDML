Kahler Cone Substructure
</title>

<abstract>
  To define a consistent perturbative geometric heterotic compactification the
bundle is required to satisfy a subtle constraint known as ``stability,'' which
depends upon the Kahler form. This dependence upon the Kahler form is highly
nontrivial---the Kahler cone splits into subcones, with a distinct moduli space
of bundles in each subcone---and has long been overlooked by physicists. In
this article we describe this behavior and its physical manifestation.
