<title>
Equilibrium Statistical Ensembles and Structure of the Entropy
  Functional in Generalized Quantum Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We review here the microcanonical and canonical ensembles constructed on an
underlying generalized quantum dynamics and the algebraic properties of the
conserved quantities. We discuss the structure imposed on the microcanonical
entropy by the equilibrium conditions.
