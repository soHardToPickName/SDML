Self-dual Yang--Mills Theory and One-Loop Maximally Helicity Violating
  Multi-Gluon Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  A scalar cubic action that classically reproduces the self-dual Yang--Mills
equations is shown to generate one-loop QCD amplitudes for external gluon all
with the same helicity. This result is related to the symmetries of the
self-dual Yang--Mills equations.
