<title>
Two-loop renormalization of N=1 supersymmetric electrodynamics,
  regularized by higher derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-loop $\beta$-function and anomalous dimension are calculated for N=1
supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics, regularized by higher derivatives in
the minimal subtraction scheme. The result for two-loop contribution to the
$\beta$-function appears to be equal to 0, does not depend on the form of
regularizing term and does not lead to anomaly puzzle. Two-loop anomalous
dimension can be also made independent on parameters of higher derivative
regularization by a special choice of subtraction scheme.
