<title>
Supersymmetry on AdS3 and AdS4
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a supersymmetric extension of the algebra associated with three
and four dimensional Anti de Sitter space. A representation of the
supersymmetry operators in superspace is given. Supersymmetry invariant models
are constructed for the superspace associated with AdS3.
