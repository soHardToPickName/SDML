<title>
A model for charges of electromagnetic type
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a simple but instructive model in which Gauss' law holds for a
class of charged states. In spite of the non-localizability of these charges,
the corresponding superselection sectors can be labelled by the spectrum of
some internal symmetry group and have well defined statistics. More
interestingly, the properties of these charged states seem to point to a
general argument allowing one to establish these features for any theory with
charges of electric or magnetic type.
