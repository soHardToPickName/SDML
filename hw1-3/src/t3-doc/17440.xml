<title>
On the renormalizability and unitarity of the Curci-Ferrari model for
  massive vector bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the renormalizability of the Curci-Ferrari model with and without
auxiliary fields using BRST methods. In both cases we find 5 $Z$ factors
instead of 3. We verify our results by explicit one loop calculations. We
determine a set of generators for the ``physical states'', many of which have
negative norm. Supersymmetrization is considered.
