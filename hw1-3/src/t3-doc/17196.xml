<title>
Two-dimensional QCD and strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A review is given of recent research on two-dimensional gauge theories, with
particular emphasis on the equivalence between these theories and certain
string theories with a two-dimensional target space. Some related open problems
are discussed.
