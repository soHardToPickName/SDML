<title>
Superextendons with a modified measure
</title>

<abstract>
  For superstrings, the consequences of replacing the measure of integration
$\sqrt{-\gamma}d^2 x$ in the Polyakov's action by $\Phi d^2 x$ where $\Phi$ is
a density built out of degrees of freedom independent of the metric
$\gamma_{ab}$ defined in the string are studied. As in Siegel reformulation of
the Green Schwarz formalism the Wess-Zumino term is the square of
supersymmetric currents. As opposed to the Siegel case, the compensating fields
needed for this do not enter into the action just as in a total derivative.
They instead play a crucial role to make up a consistent dynamics. The string
tension appears as an integration constant of the equations of motion. The
generalization to higher dimensional extended objects is also studied using in
this case the Bergshoeff and Sezgin formalism with the associated additional
fields, which again are dynamically relevant unlike the standard formulation.
Also unlike the standard formulation, there is no need of a cosmological term
on the world brane.
