Supersymmetric Topological Quantum Field Theories Of Differential Forms
  I. Gauge p-forms
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the topological theory of Witten type for gauge differential
p-forms. It is shown that some topological invariants such as linking numbers
appear under quantization of this theory. The non-abelian generalization of the
model is discussed.
