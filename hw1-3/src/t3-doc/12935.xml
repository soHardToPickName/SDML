2D Quantum Gravity Coupled to Renormalizable Matter Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter fields which
are renormalizable, but not conformal invariant. Questions concerning the $\b$
function and the effective action are addressed, and the effective action and
the dressed renormalization group equations are determined for various matter
potentials.
