<title>
BRS Operators and Covariant Derivatives in Loop Space for P-Branes
  Coupled to Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  Canonical forms are given for the nilpotent BRS operator $\d$ and the
covariant `loop space' derivative ${\cal D}_{\m}$ for the p-brane fields for
all odd p. The defining characteristic of ${\cal D}_{\m}$ is that it is a
functional derivative operator which generalizes the ordinary functional
derivative and also commutes with $\d$. Methods of construction for the
canonical forms are discussed.
