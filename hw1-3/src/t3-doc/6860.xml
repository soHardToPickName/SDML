<title>
Probing black holes in non-perturbative gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a 0-brane to probe a ten-dimensional near-extremal black hole with N
units of 0-brane charge. We work directly in the dual strongly-coupled quantum
mechanics, using mean-field methods to describe the black hole background
non-perturbatively. We obtain the distribution of W boson masses, and find a
clear separation between light and heavy degrees of freedom. To localize the
probe we introduce a resolving time and integrate out the heavy modes. After a
non-trivial change of coordinates, the effective potential for the probe agrees
with supergravity expectations. We compute the entropy of the probe, and find
that the stretched horizon of the black hole arises dynamically in the quantum
mechanics, as thermal restoration of unbroken U(N+1) gauge symmetry. Our
analysis of the quantum mechanics predicts a correct relation between the
horizon radius and entropy of a black hole.
