1-Loop Analysis of the Photon Self-Energy due to 3D-Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A Maxwell-Chern-Simons field is minimally coupled to 3D-gravity. Feynman
rules are written down and 1-loop corrections to the gauge-field self-energy
are calculated. Transversality is verified and gauge-field dynamical mass
generation does not take place.
