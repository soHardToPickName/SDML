Finite-difference representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra in which the
analogues of the Dunkl operators are given by finite-difference operators are
introduced. The non-selfadjoint lattice analogues of the spin
Calogero-Sutherland hamiltonians are analysed by Bethe-Ansatz. The $
sl(m)$-Yangian representations arising from the finite-difference
representations of the degenerate affine Hecke algebra are shown to be related
to the Yangian representation of the 1-d Hubbard Model.
