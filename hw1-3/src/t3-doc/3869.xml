N=1 Finite Unified Theories - Predictions and Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  N = 1, all-loop Finite Unified Theories (FUTs) are very interesting not only
since they realize an old theoretical dream, but also due the remarkable
predictive power of particular models as well as for providing candidates that
might shed light in non-perturbative Physics.
 Here we discuss (a) the recent developments concerning the soft supersymmetry
breaking (SSB) sector of these theories and the resulting predictions in very
interesting realistic models, and (b) the results of a recent search for duals
of N=1, all-loop FUTs.
