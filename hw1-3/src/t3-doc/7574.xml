<title>
The D1-D5 Brane System in Type I String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the supergravity solution for the intersecting D1-D5 brane
system in Type I String Theory. The solution encodes the dependence on all the
electric charges of the SO(32) gauge group. We discuss the near horizon
geometry of the solution and a proposed dual (0,4) superconformal field theory.
