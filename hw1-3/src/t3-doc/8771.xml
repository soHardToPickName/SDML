Fractional Branes on a Non-compact Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  Fractional branes on the non-compact orbifold $\C^3/\Z_5$ are studied. First,
the boundary state description of the fractional branes are obtained. The
open-string Witten index calculated using these states reproduces the adjacency
matrix of the quiver of $\Z_5$. Then, using the toric crepant resolution of the
orbifold $\C^3/\Z_5$ and invoking the local mirror principle, B-type branes
wrapped on the holomorphic cycles of the resolution are studied. The boundary
states corresponding to the five fractional branes are identified as bound
states of BPS D-branes wrapping the 0-, 2- and 4-cycles in the exceptional
divisor of the resolution of $\C^3/\Z_5$.
