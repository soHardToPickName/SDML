<title>
$n$-point functions of $2d$ Yang-Mills theories on Riemann surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the simple path integral method we calculate the $n$-point functions of
field strength of Yang-Mills theories on arbitrary two-dimensional Riemann
surfaces. In $U(1)$ case we show that the correlators consist of two parts , a
free and an $x$-independent part. In the case of non-abelian semisimple compact
gauge groups we find the non-gauge invariant correlators in Schwinger-Fock
gauge and show that it is also divided to a free and an almost $x$-independent
part. We also find the gauge-invariant Green functions and show that they
correspond to a free field theory.
