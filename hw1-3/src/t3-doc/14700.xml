<title>
Boundaries of 11-Dimensional Membranes
</title>

<abstract>
  The action for an 11-dimensional supermembrane contains a chiral
Wess-Zumino-Witten model coupling to the E8 super-Yang-Mills theory on the
end-of-the-world 9-brane. It is demonstrated that this boundary string theory
is dictated both by gauge invariance and by kappa-symmetry.
