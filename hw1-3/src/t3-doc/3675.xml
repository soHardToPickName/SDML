BFV--BRST Analysis of the Classical and Quantum q-deformations of the
  sl(2) Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  BFV--BRST charge for q-deformed algebras is not unique. Different
constructions of it in the classical as well as in the quantum phase space for
the $q$-deformed algebra sl_q(2) are discussed. Moreover, deformation of the
phase space without deforming the generators of sl(2) is considered.
$\hbar$-q-deformation of the phase space is shown to yield the Witten's second
deformation. To study the BFV--BRST cohomology problem when both the quantum
phase space and the group are deformed, a two parameter deformation of sl(2) is
proposed, and its BFV-BRST charge is given.
