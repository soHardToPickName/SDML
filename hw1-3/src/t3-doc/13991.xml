Localized Massive Gravity from B Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider five-dimensional domain-wall solutions which arise from a sphere
reduction in M-theory or string theory and have the higher-dimensional
interpretation as the near-horizon region of p-branes in constant, background B
fields. We analyze the fluctuation spectrum of linearized gravity and find that
there is a massive state which is localized and plays the role of the
four-dimensional graviton.
