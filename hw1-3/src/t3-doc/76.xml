<title>
Noncommutative Solitons and Intersecting D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct intersecting D-branes as noncommutative solitons in bosonic and
type II string theory. ``Defect'' branes which are D-branes containing bubbles
of the closed string vacuum play an important role in the construction.
