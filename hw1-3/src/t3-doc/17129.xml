<title>
A Class of Quantum States with Classical-like Evolution
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of Nelson stochastic quantization we derive exact
non-stationary states for a class of time-dependent potentials. The
wave-packets follow a classical motion with constant dispersion. The new states
thus define a possible extension of the harmonic-oscillator coherent states to
more general potentials. As an explicit example we give a detailed treatement
of a sestic oscillator potential.
