AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence and near-extremal black hole entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a realization of the AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence in terms of
asymptotic symmetries of the AdS$_2\times$S$^1$ and AdS$_2\times$S$^2$
geometries arising in near-extremal BTZ and Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.
Cardy's formula exactly accounts for the deviation of the Bekenstein-Hawking
entropy from extremality. We also argue that this result can be extended to
more general black holes near extremality.
