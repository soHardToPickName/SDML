<title>
Correlation functions of the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain at the free
  fermion point from their multiple integral representations
</title>

<abstract>
  Using multiple integral representations, we derive exact expressions for the
correlation functions of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain at the free fermion
point.
