Early Universe Evolution in Graviton-Dilaton Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of graviton-dilaton models which leads to a singularity
free evolution of the universe. We study the evolution of a homogeneous
isotropic universe. We follow an approach which enables us to analyse the
evolution and obtain its generic features even in the absence of explicit
solutions, which are not possible in general. We describe the generic evolution
of the universe and show, in particular, that it is singularity free in the
present class of models. Such models may stand on their own as interesting
models for singularity free cosmology, and may be studied accordingly. They may
also arise from string theory. We discuss critically a few such possibilities.
