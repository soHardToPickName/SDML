Finite [q-Oscillator] Description of 2-D String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple physical representation for states of the two-dimensional
string theory. In order to incorporate a fundamental cutoff of the order 1/g we
use a picture consisting of q-oscillators at the first-quantized level. In this
framework we also find a representation for the (singular) negatively dressed
states representing nontrivial string backgrounds.
