<title>
Flat Symplectic Bundles of N-Extended Supergravities, Central Charges
  and Black-Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lectures we give a geometrical formulation of N-extended
supergravities which generalizes N=2 special geometry of N=2 theories. In all
these theories duality symmetries are related to the notion of "flat symplectic
bundles" and central charges may be defined as "sections" over these bundles.
Attractor points giving rise to "fixed scalars" of the horizon geometry and
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for extremal black-holes are discussed in
some details.
