<title>
Non-Hermitian oscillator-like Hamiltonians and $\lambda$-coherent states
  revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  Previous $\lambda$-deformed {\it non-Hermitian} Hamiltonians with respect to
the usual scalar product of Hilbert spaces dealing with harmonic
oscillator-like developments are (re)considered with respect to a new scalar
product in order to take into account their property of self-adjointness. The
corresponding deformed $\lambda$-states lead to new families of coherent states
according to the DOCS, AOCS and MUCS points of view.
