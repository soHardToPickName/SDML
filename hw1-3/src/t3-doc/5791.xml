<title>
Casimir force between surfaces close to each other
</title>

<abstract>
  Casimir interactions (due to the massless scalar field fluctuations) of two
surfaces which are close to each other are studied.
  After a brief general presentation, explicit calculations for co-axial
cylinders, co-centric spheres and co-axial cones are performed.
