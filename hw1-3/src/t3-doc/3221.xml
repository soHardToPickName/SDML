More on N=1 Self-Dualities and Exceptional Gauge Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a generalization of a recent result on self-duality we
systematically analyze self-dual models. We find a criterion to judge whether a
given model is self-dual or not. With this tool we construct some new self-dual
pairs, focussing on examples with exceptional gauge groups.
