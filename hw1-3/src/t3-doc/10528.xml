<title>
String Effective Actions and Cosmological Stability of Scalar Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmology of the string effective action, including one loop string
threshold corrections, is analyzed for static compactifications. The stability
of the minima of a general supersymmetry breaking potential is studied in the
presence of radiation. In particular, it is shown that the radiation bath makes
the minima with negative cosmological constant unstable.
