Scalar Quartic Effective Action on $AdS_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the recent results concerning the computation of cubic and quartic
couplings of scalar fields in type IIB supergravity on AdS_5\times S^5
background that are dual to (extended) chiral primary operators in N=4 SYM_4.
We discuss the vanishing of certain cubic and quartic couplings and
non-renormalization property of corresponding correlators in the conformal
field theory
