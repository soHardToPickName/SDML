<title>
Riemann surfaces, separation of variables and classical and quantum
  integrability
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Riemann surfaces, and separated variables immediately provide
classical Poisson commuting Hamiltonians. We show that Baxter's equations for
separated variables immediately provide quantum commuting Hamiltonians. The
construction is simple, general, and does not rely on the Yang--Baxter
equation.
