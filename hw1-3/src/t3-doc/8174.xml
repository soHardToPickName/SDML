Generalizations of the Andrews-Bressoud Identities for the $N=1$
  Superconformal Model $SM(2,4\nu)$
</title>

<abstract>
  We present generalized Rogers-Ramanujan identities which relate the fermi and
bose forms of all the characters of the superconformal model $SM(2,4\nu).$ In
particular we show that to each bosonic form of the character there is an
infinite family of distinct fermionic $q-$ series representations.
