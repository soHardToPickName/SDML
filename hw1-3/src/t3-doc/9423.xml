M5-branes with 3/8 supersymmetry in pp-wave background
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct M5-branes in pp-wave background and find that they preserve
exactly half of the background pp-wave supersymmetries. We explicitly write
down the standard as well as supernumerary Killing spinors and find that their
respective numbers are also half of those for the pp-wave background. This is
in line with the recent work of Dabholkar et.al. which shows
half-supersymmetric D-branes can be constructed in Hpp-wave background.
