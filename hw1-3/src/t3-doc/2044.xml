The Bekenstein Formula and String Theory (N-brane Theory)
</title>

<abstract>
  A review of recent progress in string theory concerning the Bekenstein
formula for black hole entropy is given. Topics discussed include p-branes,
D-branes and supersymmetry; the correspondence principle; the D- and M-brane
approach to black hole entropy; the D-brane analogue of Hawking radiation, and
information loss; D-branes as probes of black holes; and the Matrix theory
approach to charged and neutral black holes. Some introductory material is
included.
