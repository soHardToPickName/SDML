<title>
The extremal limit of D-dimensional black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The extreme limit of a class of D-dimensional black holes is revisited. In
the static limit, it is shown that well defined extremal limiting procedure
exists and it leads to new solutions of the type AdS2 times constant curvature
symmetric spaces.
