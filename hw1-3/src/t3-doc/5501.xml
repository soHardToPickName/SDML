<title>
The Super W_3 Conformal Algebra and the Boussinesq Hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  The bihamiltonian structure of the N=2 Supersymmetric Boussinesq equation is
found. It is not reduced to the corresponding classical structure and hence it
describes the pure supersymmetric effect. For the supersymmetric Boussinesq
equation which contains the classical partner the Lax pair is given explicitly.
Thus we prove the integrability of the equation.
