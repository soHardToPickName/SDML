Manifestations of Space-Time Multidimensionality in Scattering of Scalar
  Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze a possibility of experimental detection of the contribution of the
Kaluza-Klein tower of heavy particles to scattering cross-section in a
six-dimensional scalar model with two dimensions being compactified to the
torus with the radii $R$. It is shown that there is a noticeable effect even
for the energies of colliding particles below $R^{-1}$ which may be observed in
future collider experiments if $R^{-1}$ is of the order of $1 TeV$.
