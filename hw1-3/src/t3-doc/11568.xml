<title>
Duality in Non-Supersymmetric MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The curves that describe the M-theoretic extension of type IIA string
configurations with non-supersymmetric field theories on their surface exhibit
a duality map. The map suggests a continued link between a SU(N) gauge theory
with F flavours and an SU(F-N) gauge theory with F flavours (the duality of
supersymmetric QCD) even when the gaugino mass is taken to infinity. Within the
context of the field theory such a duality only continues to make sense if the
scalar fields remain light. We discuss the difficulties of decoupling the
scalars within this framework.
