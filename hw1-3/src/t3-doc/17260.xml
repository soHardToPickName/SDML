<title>
Ultralocal solutions for quantum integrable nonultralocal models
</title>

<abstract>
  A challenge in the theory of integrable systems is to show for every
nonultralocal quantum integrable model, a possible connection to an ultralocal
model. Some of such gauge connections were discovered earlier. We complete the
task by identifying the same for the remaining ones along with two new models.
We also unveil the underlying algebraic structure for these nonultralocal
models.
