<title>
On the amplitudes for non-critical n=2 supuerstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute correlation functions in $N=2$ non critical superstrings on the
sphere. Our calculations are restrained to the ($s=0$) bulk amplitudes. We show
that the four point function factorizes as a consequence of the non-critical
kinematics, but differently from the $N=0,1$ cases no extra discrete state
appears in the $\hat c\to 1^-$ limit.
