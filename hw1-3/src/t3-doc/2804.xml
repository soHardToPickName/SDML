<title>
An Elementary Derivation of the Black-Hole Area-Entropy Relation in Any
  Dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  A straightforward two-line derivation of the Bekenstein-Hawking Area-Entropy
relation for Black-Holes in {\bf any} dimension is shown based on Shannon's
information theory and Clifford algebras required by the New Relativity
Principle.
