Quantum Sturm-Liouville Equation, Quantum Resolvent, Quantum Integrals,
  and Quantum KdV : the Fast Decrease Case
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct quantum operators solving the quantum versions of the
Sturm-Liouville equation and the resolvent equation, and show the existence of
conserved currents. The construction depends on the following input data: the
basic quantum field $O(k)$ and the regularization .
