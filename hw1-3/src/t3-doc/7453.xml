Dbrane Phase Transitions and Monodromy in K-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Majumder and Sen have given an explicit construction of a first order phase
transition in a non-supersymmetric system of Dbranes that occurs when the B
field is varied. We show that the description of this transition in terms of
K-theory involves a bundle of K groups of non-commutative algebras over the
Kahler cone with nontrivial monodromy. Thus the study of monodromy in K groups
associated with quantized algebras can be used to predict the phase structure
of systems of (non-supersymmetric) Dbranes.
