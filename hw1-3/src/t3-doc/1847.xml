Four-Brane and Six-Brane Interactions in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the proposed description of configurations with four-branes and
six-branes in m(atrix) theory. Computing the velocity dependent potential
between these configurations and gravitons and membranes, we show that they
agree with the short distance string results computed in type IIa string
theory. Due to the ``closeness'' of these configuration to a supersymmetric
configuration the m(atrix) theory reproduces the correct long distance
behavior.
