<title>
Quantum field components of supersymmetric multiplets
</title>

<abstract>
  We adress the problem of Fock space representations of (free) multiplet
component fiels encountered in supersymmetric quantum field theory insisting on
positivity and causality. We look in detail on the scalar and Majorana
components of the chiral supersymmetric multiplet. Several Fock space
representations are introduced. The last section contains a short application
to the supersymmetric Epstein-Glaser method. The present paper is written in
the vane of axiomatic quantum field theory with applications to the causal
approach to supersymmetry.
