Kaluza-Klein Induced Gravity Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  A D-dimensional induced gravity theory is studied carefully in a $4 + (D-4)$
dimensional Friedmann-Robertson-Walker space-time. We try to extract
information of the symmetry breaking potential in search of an inflationary
solution with non-expanding internal-space. We find that the induced gravity
model imposes strong constraints on the form of symmetry breaking potential in
order to generate an acceptable inflationary universe. These constraints are
analyzed carefully in this paper.
