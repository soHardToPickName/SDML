Quotient Stacks and String Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short review we outline some recent developments in understanding
string orbifolds. In particular, we outline the recent observation that string
orbifolds do not precisely describe string propagation on quotient spaces, but
rather are literally sigma models on objects called quotient stacks, which are
closely related to (but not quite the same as) quotient spaces. We show how
this is an immediate consequence of definitions, and also how this explains a
number of features of string orbifolds, from the fact that the CFT is
well-behaved to orbifold Euler characteristics. Put another way, many features
of string orbifolds previously considered ``stringy'' are now understood as
coming from the target-space geometry; one merely needs to identify the correct
target-space geometry.
