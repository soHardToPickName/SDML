Comments on Topologically Massive Gravity with Propagating Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  We study and discuss some of the consequences of the inclusion of torsion in
3D Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity. Torsion may trigger the excitation of
non-physical modes in the spectrum. Higher-derivative terms are then added up
and tree-level unitarity is contemplated.
