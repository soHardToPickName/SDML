<title>
The 2-Parametric Extension of $h$ Deformation of $GL(2)$, and The
  Differential Calculus on Its Quantum Plane
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an alternative 2-parametric deformation $ GL(2)_{h,h'} $ , and
construct the differential calculus on the quantum plane on which this quantum
group acts. Also we give a new deformation of the two dimensional Heisenberg
algebra
