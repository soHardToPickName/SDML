<title>
Is the Chiral Model equivalent to Wess-Zumino-Witten Model when coupled
  with Gravity?
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the non-abelian $T$-duality of Wess-Zumino-Witten model. The
obtained dual model is equivalent to the model dual to the $SU(2)$ chiral model
found by Curtright-Zachos. This might tell that the Wess-Zumino term would be
induced when the chiral model couples with gravity.
