<title>
A Generalized Duality Symmetry for Nonabelian Yang-Mills Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that classical nonsupersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 4
dimensions is symmetric under a generalized dual transform which reduces to the
usual dual *-operation for electromagnetism. The parallel phase transport
$\tilde{A}_\mu(x)$ constructed earlier for monopoles is seen to function also
as a potential in giving full description of the gauge field, playing thus an
entirely dual symmetric role to the usual potential $A_\mu(x)$. Sources of $A$
are monopoles of $\tilde{A}$ and vice versa, and the Wu-Yang criterion for
monopoles is found to yield as equations of motion the standard Wong and
Yang-Mills equations for respectively the classical and Dirac point charge;
this applies whether the charge is electric or magnetic, the two cases being
related just by a dual transform. The dual transformation itself is explicit,
though somewhat complicated, being given in terms of loop space variables of
the Polyakov type.
