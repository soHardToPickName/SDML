Second Virial Coefficient for Noncommutative Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The second virial coefficient $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ for non-interacting particles
moving in a two-dimensional noncommutative space and in the presence of a
uniform magnetic field $\vec B$ is presented. The noncommutativity parameter
$\te$ can be chosen such that the $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can be interpreted as the
second virial coefficient for anyons of statistics $\al$ in the presence of
$\vec B$ and living on the commuting plane. In particular in the high
temperature limit $\be\lga 0$, we establish a relation between the parameter
$\te$ and the statistics $\al$. Moreover, $B_{2}^{nc}(T)$ can also be
interpreted in terms of composite fermions.
