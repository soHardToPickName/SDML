<title>
Locally Anisotropic Interactions: III. Higher Order Anisotropic
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A general approach to formulation of supergravity in higher order anisotropic
superspaces (containing as particular cases different supersymmetric extensions
and prolongations of Riemann, Finsler, Lagrange and Kaluza--Klein spaces) is
given. We analyze three models of locally anisotropic supergravity.
