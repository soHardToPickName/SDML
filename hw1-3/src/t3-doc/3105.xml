Liouville theory revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We try to develop a coherent picture on Liouville theory as a two-dimensional
conformal field theory that takes into account the perspectives of
path-integral approach, bootstrap, canonical quantization and operator
approach. To do this, we need to develop further some of these approaches. This
includes in particular a construction of general exponential field operators
from a set of covariant chiral operators. The latter are shown to satisfy braid
relations that allow one to prove the locality of the former.
