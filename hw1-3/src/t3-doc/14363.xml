<title>
Symplectic Geometry of Supersymmetry and Nonlinear Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it has been argued, that Poincar\'{e} supersymmetric field theories
admit an underlying loop space hamiltonian (symplectic) structure. Here shall
establish this at the level of a general $N=1$ supermultiplet. In particular,
we advocate the use of a superloop space and explain the necessity of using
nonconventional auxiliary fields. As an example we consider the nonlinear
$\sigma$-model. Due to the quartic fermionic term, we conclude that the use of
superloop space variables is necessary for the action to have a hamiltonian
loop space interpretation.
