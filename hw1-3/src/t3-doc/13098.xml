<title>
Non-Trivial Non-Canonical W-Algebras from Kac-Moody Reductions
</title>

<abstract>
  By reducing a split $G_2$ Kac-Moody algebra by a non-maximal set of
first-class constraints we produce W-algebras which (i) contain fields of
negative conformal spin and (ii) are not trivial extensions of canonical
W-algebras.
