<title>
SU(N) Matrix Difference Equations and a Nested Bethe Ansatz
</title>

<abstract>
  A system of SU(N)-matrix difference equations is solved by means of a nested
version of a generalized Bethe Ansatz, also called "off shell" Bethe Ansatz.
The highest weight property of the solutions is proved. (Part I of a series of
articles on the generalized nested Bethe Ansatz and difference equations.)
