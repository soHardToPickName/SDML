<title>
Antibrackets, Supersymmetric $\sigma$-Model and Localization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider supersymmetrization of Hamiltonian dynamics via antibrackets for
systems whose Hamiltonian generates an isometry of the phase space. We find
that the models are closely related to the supersymmetric non-linear
$\sigma$-model. We interpret the corres\-ponding path integrals in terms of
super loop space equivariant cohomology. It turns out that they can be
evaluated exactly using localizations techniques.
