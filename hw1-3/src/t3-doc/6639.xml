<title>
Quantum gravity, the Planck lattice and the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
A possible ground state of Quantum Gravity is Wheeler's ``space-time foam'',
which can be modeled as a ``Planck-lattice'', a space-time cubic lattice of
lattice constant $a_P\simeq 10^{33}$cm, the Planck length. I analyse the
structure of the Standard Model defined on the Planck Lattice, in the light of
the ``no-go'' theorem of Nielsen and Ninomiya, which requires an extension of
the continuum model through Nambu-Jona Lasinio terms, quadrilinear in the
Fermi-fields. As a result, a theory of masses (of both fermions and gauge
bosons) is seen to emerge that, without Higgs excitations, agrees well with
observations.
