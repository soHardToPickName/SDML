<title>
Spacetime Foam and the Casimir Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture that the neutral black hole pair production is related to the
vacuum fluctuation of pure gravity via the Casimir-like energy. A
generalization of this process to a multi-black hole pair is considered.
Implications on the foam-like structure of spacetime and on the cosmological
constant are discussed.
