Perturbative quantum gauge fields on the noncommutative torus
</title>

<abstract>
  Using standard field theoretical techniques, we survey pure Yang-Mills theory
on the noncommutative torus, including Feynman rules and BRS symmetry. Although
in general free of any infrared singularity, the theory is ultraviolet
divergent. Because of an invariant regularization scheme, this theory turns out
to be renormalizable and the detailed computation of the one loop counterterms
is given, leading to an asymptoticaly free theory. Besides, it turns out that
non planar diagrams are overall convergent when $\theta$ is irrational.
