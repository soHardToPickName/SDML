<title>
Negative Energy Condition and Black Holes on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that for non-localizable energy distribution the relevant energy
condition is determined by the gravitational field energy which is negative for
positive non-gravitational energy. That is negativity of the non-localized
energy is the "positive" energy condition. This would have direct application
and relevance for a black hole on the brane which would be sitting in a trace
free stresses induced by the Weyl curvature of the bulk.
