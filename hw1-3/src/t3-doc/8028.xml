Putting an Edge to the Poisson Bracket
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a general formalism for treating a Hamiltonian (canonical) field
theory with a spatial boundary. In this formalism essentially all functionals
are differentiable from the very beginning and hence no improvement terms are
needed. We introduce a new Poisson bracket which differs from the usual
``bulk'' Poisson bracket with a boundary term and show that the Jacobi identity
is satisfied. The result is geometrized on an abstract world volume manifold.
The method is suitable for studying systems with a spatial edge like the ones
often considered in Chern-Simons theory and General Relativity. Finally, we
discuss how the boundary terms may be related to the time ordering when
quantizing.
