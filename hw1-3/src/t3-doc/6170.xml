<title>
Towards a covariant canonical formulation for closed topological defects
  without boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  On the basis of the covariant description of the canonical formalism for
quantization, we present the basic elements of the symplectic geometry for a
restricted class of topological defects propagating on a curved background
spacetime. We discuss the future extensions of the present results.
