<title>
Confining Phase of N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and N=2 Massless
  Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Effective superpotentials for the phase with a confined photon are obtained
in $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories. We use the results to derive the
hyperelliptic curves which describe the Coulomb phase of $N=2$ theories with
classical gauge groups, and thus extending the prior result for $SU(N_c)$ gauge
theory by Elitzur et al. Moreover, adjusting the coupling constants in $N=1$
effective superpotentials to the values of $N=2$ non-trivial critical points we
find new classes of $N=1$ superconformal field theories with an adjoint matter
with a superpotential.
