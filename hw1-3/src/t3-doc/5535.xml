Scaling Dimensions of Lattice Quantized Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss a model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial lattice
discretization. It has been studied in some detail using a comprehensive finite
size scaling analysis combined with renormalization group methods. The results
are consistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation
$\nu=1/3$, and suggest a simple relationship between Newton's constant, the
gravitational correlation length and the observable average space-time
curvature. Some perhaps testable phenomenological implications are discussed,
such as the scale dependence of Newton's constant and properties of quantum
curvature fluctuations.
