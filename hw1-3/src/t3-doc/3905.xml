Phases of Braneworlds, Spinning D3-branes and Strongly-Coupled Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A spinning nonextremal D3-brane undergoes a phase transition to a naked
singularity which, from the braneworld point of view, corresponds to the
apparent graviton speed passing from subluminal to superluminal. We investigate
this phase transition from the dual perspectives of braneworld scenarios and
holography. We discuss the relevance of the thermodynamic stability domains of
a spinning D3-brane to the physics of braneworld scenarios. We also describe
various gravitational Lorentz violations which arise from static D3-branes.
