Noncommutative/Nonlinear BPS Equations without Zero Slope Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  It is widely believed that via the Seiberg-Witten map, the linearly realized
BPS equation in the non-commutative space is related to the non-linearly
realized BPS equation in the commutative space in the zero slope limit. We show
that the relation also holds without taking the zero slope limit as is expected
from the arguments of the BPS equation for the non-Abelian Born-Infeld theory.
This is regarded as an evidence for the relation between the two BPS equations.
As a byproduct of our analysis, the non-linear instanton equation is solved
exactly.
