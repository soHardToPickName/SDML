<title>
Supergravity the DBI Action and Black Hole Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  The assumptions behind the recently conjectured relation between gauge theory
and supergravity are elaborated on. It is pointed out that the scaling limit
that preserves supergravity solutions, gives the entire DBI action on the gauge
theory side, but in the low energy limit the relation between the conformal
field theory and Anti-de Sitter supergravity emerges. We also argue that recent
work on these issues may help in understanding the physics of five (four)
dimensional black hole with three (four) charges in the so-called dilute gas
region.
