Kaluza-Klein on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  The M-theory interpretation of certain D=10 IIA p-branes implies the
existence of worldvolume Kaluza-Klein modes which are expected to appear as
0-brane/p-brane bound states preserving 1/4 of the spacetime supersymmetry. We
construct the corresponding solutions of the effective supergravity theory for
$p=1,4$, and show that no such solution exists for $p=8$.
