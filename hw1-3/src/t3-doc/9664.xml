<title>
The O(N) sigma-model Laplacian
</title>

<abstract>
  For fields that vary slowly on the scale of the lightest mass the logarithm
of the vacuum functional of a massive quantum field theory can be expanded in
terms of local functionals satisfying a form of the Schr\"odinger equation, the
principal ingredient of which is a regulated functional Laplacian. We construct
to leading order a Laplacian for the O(N) sigma-model that acts on such local
functionals. It is determined by imposing rotational invariance in the internal
space together with closure of the Poincar\'e algebra.
