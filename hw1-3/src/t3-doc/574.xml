A note on brane tension and M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that some M-theory results for brane tension can be derived from
Polchinski's formula for D-brane tension. We also argue that this formula
determines gravitational and gauge couplings in the low energy but quantum
exact effective action.
