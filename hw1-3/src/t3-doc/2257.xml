Forces from noncommutative geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Einstein derived general relativity from Riemannian geometry. Connes extends
this derivation to noncommutative geometry and obtains electro-magnetic, weak
and strong forces. These are pseudo forces, that accompany the gravitational
force just as in Minkowskian geometry the magnetic force accompanies the
electric force. The main physical input of Connes' derivation is parity
violation. His main output is the Higgs boson which breaks the gauge symmetry
spontaneously and gives masses to gauge and Higgs bosons.
