<title>
Conformal (super)gravities with several gravitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct consistent interacting gauge theories for M conformal massless
spin-2 fields ("Weyl gravitons") with the following properties: (i) in the free
limit, each field fulfills the equation ${\cal B}^{\mu \nu} = 0$, where ${\cal
B}^{\mu \nu}$ is the linearized Bach tensor, (ii) the interactions contain no
more than four derivatives, just as the free action and (iii) the internal
metric for the Weyl gravitons is not positive definite. The interacting
theories are obtained by gauging appropriate non-semi-simple extensions of the
conformal algebra $so(4,2)$ with commutative, associative algebras of dimension
M. By writing the action in terms of squares of supercurvatures,
supersymmetrization is immediate and leads to consistent conformal
supergravities with M interacting gravitons.
