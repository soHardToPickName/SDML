<title>
Order-chaos transitions in field theories with topological terms: a
  dynamical systems approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a comparative study of the dynamical behaviour of topological
systems of recent interest, namely the non-Abelian Chern-Simons Higgs system
and the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs system. By reducing the full field
theories to temporal differential systems using the assumption of spatially
homogeneous fields , we study the Lyapunov exponents for two types of initial
conditions. We also examine in minute detail the behaviour of the Lyapunov
spectra as a function of the various coupling parameters in the system. We
compare and contrast our results with those for Abelian Higgs, Yang-Mills Higgs
and Yang-Mills Chern-Simons systems which have been discussed by other authors
recently. The role of the various terms in the Hamiltonians for such systems in
determining the order-disorder transitions is emphasized and shown to be
counter-intuitive in the Yang-Mills Chern-Simons Higgs systems.
