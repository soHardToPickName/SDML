Mode-by-mode summation for the zero point electromagnetic energy of an
  infinite cylinder
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the mode-by-mode summation technique the zero point energy of the
electromagnetic field is calculated for the boundary conditions given on the
surface of an infinite solid cylinder. It is assumed that the dielectric and
magnetic characteristics of the material which makes up the cylinder
$(\epsilon_1, \mu_1)$ and of that which makes up the surroundings $(\epsilon_2,
\mu_2)$ obey the relation $\epsilon_1\mu_1= \epsilon_2\mu_2$. With this
assumption all the divergences cancel. The divergences are regulated by making
use of zeta function techniques. Numerical calculations are carried out for a
dilute dielectric cylinder and for a perfectly conducting cylindrical shell.
The Casimir energy in the first case vanishes, and in the second is in complete
agreement with that obtained by DeRaad and Milton who employed a Green's
function technique with an ultraviolet regulator.
