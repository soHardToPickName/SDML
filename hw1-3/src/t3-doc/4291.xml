<title>
On the solution of a supersymmetric model of correlated electrons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the exact solution of a model of correlated electrons based on
the superalgebra $Osp(2|2)$. The corresponding Bethe ansatz equations have an
interesting form. We derive an expression for the ground state energy at half
filling. We also present the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix commuting with
the Hamiltonian.
