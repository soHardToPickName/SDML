<title>
On central extensions of anti-de-Sitter algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the study of branes in curved backgrounds, we investigate the
construction of central extensions of the super-isometry algebra osp*(8|4) of
the AdS7 x S4 background of M-theory. This algebra is not a subalgebra of
osp(1|32) and its central extension can therefore not be obtained by embedding
in this simple superalgebra. We show how, instead, it is possible to construct
an extension directly by solving Jacobi identities. This requires, in addition
to the expected central charges, the introduction of new ones which appear in
the {Q,Q} commutator only via a linear combination with the bosonic generators
of the isometry algebra. The resulting extended algebra has the correct
flat-space limit, but it is not simple and the central charges do not commute
with the super-isometry generators. We comment on the consequences of this
structure for the representation theory and on possible alternatives to our
construction.
