On the quantization of isomonodromic deformations on the torus
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization of isomonodromic deformation of a meromorphic connection on
the torus is shown to lead directly to the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard
equations in the same way as the problem on the sphere leads to the system of
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. The Poisson bracket required for a
Hamiltonian formulation of isomonodromic deformations is naturally induced by
the Poisson structure of Chern-Simons theory in a holomorphic gauge fixing.
This turns out to be the origin of the appearance of twisted quantities on the
torus.
