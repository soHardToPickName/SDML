<title>
Toward a Conformal Field Theory for the Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  An effective Hamiltonian for the study of the quantum Hall effect is
proposed. This Hamiltonian, which includes a ``current-current" interaction has
the form of a Hamiltonian for a conformal field theory in the large $N$ limit.
An order parameter is constructed from which the Hamiltonian may be derived.
This order parameter may be viewed as either a collective coordinate for a
system of $N$ charged particles in a strong magnetic field; or as a field of
spins associated with the cyclotron motion of these particles.
