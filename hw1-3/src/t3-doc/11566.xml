<title>
Bounce solutions and the transition to thermal hopping in phi^4 theory
  with a phi^3 term
</title>

<abstract>
  The nature of the transition from quantum tunneling at low temperatures to
thermal hopping at high temperatures is investigated in a scalar field theory
with cubic symmetry breaking. The bounce solution which interpolates between
the zero-temperature and high-temperature solutions is obtained numerically,
using a multigrid method. It is found that, for a small value of the
symmetry-breaking coupling f, the transition is first-order. For higher values
of f, the transition continues to be first-order, though weakly so.
