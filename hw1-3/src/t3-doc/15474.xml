Reheating from Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that it may be possible to reheat the universe after inflation
driven by D-brane annihilation, due to the coupling of massless fields to the
time-dependent tachyon condensate which describes the annihilation process.
This mechanism can work if the original branes annihilate to a stable brane
containing the standard model. Given reasonable assumptions about the shape of
the tachyon background configuration and the size of the relevant extra
dimension, the reheating can be efficient enough to overcome the problem of the
universe being perpetually dominated by cold dark tachyon matter. In
particular, reheating is most efficient when the final brane codimension is
large, and when the derivatives of the tachyon background are large.
