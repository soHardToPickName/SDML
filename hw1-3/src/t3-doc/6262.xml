Double Ernst Solution in Einstein-Kalb-Ramond Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The K\"ahler formulation of 5-dimensional Einstein-Kalb-Ramond (EKR)
theory admitting two commuting Killing vectors is presented. Three different
Kramer-Neugebauer-like maps are established for the 2-dimensional case. A
class of solutions constructed on the double Ernst one is obtained. It is shown
that the double Kerr solution corresponds to a EKR dipole configuration with
horizon.
