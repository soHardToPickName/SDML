<title>
Analytical approach to the transition to thermal hopping in the thin-
  and thick-wall approximations
</title>

<abstract>
  The nature of the transition from the quantum tunneling regime at low
temperatures to the thermal hopping regime at high temperatures is investigated
analytically in scalar field theory. An analytical bounce solution is
presented, which reproduces the action in the thin-wall as well as thick-wall
limits. The transition is first order for the case of a thin wall while for the
thick wall case it is second order.
