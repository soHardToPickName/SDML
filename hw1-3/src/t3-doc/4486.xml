Comments on Noncommutative ADHM Construction
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the method of matrix partition to obtain explicitly the gauge field
for noncommutative ADHM construction in some general cases. As an application
of this method we apply it to the U(2) 2-instanton and get explicit result for
the gauge fields in the coincident instanton limit. We also easily apply it to
the noncommutative 't Hooft instantons in the appendix.
