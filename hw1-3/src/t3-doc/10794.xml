Electrons and Photons: Fact not Fiction
</title>

<abstract>
  The particle Fock space of the matter fields in QED can be constructed using
the free creation and annihilation operators. However, these particle operators
are not, even at asymptotically large times, the modes of the matter fields
that enter the QED Lagrangian. In this letter we construct the fields which do
recover such particle modes at large times. We are thus able to demonstrate for
the first time that, contrary to statements found in the literature, a
relativistic description of charged particles in QED exists.
