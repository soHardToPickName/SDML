Extended de Sitter Theory of Two Dimensional Gravitational Forces
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple unifying gauge theoretical formulation of gravitational
theories in two dimensional spacetime. This formulation includes the effects of
a novel matter-gravity coupling which leads to an extended de Sitter symmetry
algebra on which the gauge theory is based. Contractions of this theory
encompass previously studied cases.
