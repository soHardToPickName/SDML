<title>
Quasi-exact Solvability of the Pauli Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general procedure for determining possible (nonuniform) magnetic
fields such that the Pauli equation becomes quasi-exactly solvable (QES) with
an underlying $sl(2)$ symmetry. This procedure makes full use of the close
connection between QES systems and supersymmetry. Of the ten classes of
$sl(2)$-based one-dimensional QES systems, we have found that six classes allow
such construction.
