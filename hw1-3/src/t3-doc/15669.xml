Ward Identities of W_{\infty} Symmetry and Higher Genus Amplitudes in 2D
  String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Ward identities of the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry in two dimensional string
theory in the tachyon background are studied in the continuum approach. We
consider amplitudes different from 2D string ones by the external leg factor
and derive the recursion relations among them. The recursion relations have
non-linear terms which give relations among the amplitudes defined on different
genus. The solutions agree with the matrix model results even in higher genus.
We also discuss differences of roles of the external leg factor between the
$c_M = 1$ model and the $c_M <1$ model.
