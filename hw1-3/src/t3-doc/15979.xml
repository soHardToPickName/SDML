<title>
Toroidal Compactification Without Vector Structure
</title>

<abstract>
  Many important ideas about string duality that appear in conventional $\T^2$
compactification have analogs for $\T^2$ compactification without vector
structure. We analyze some of these issues and show, in particular, how
orientifold planes associated with $Sp(n)$ gauge groups can arise from
T-duality and how they can be interpreted in F-theory. We also, in an appendix,
resolve a longstanding puzzle concerning the computation of $\Tr (-1)^F$ in
four-dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with gauge group SO(n).
