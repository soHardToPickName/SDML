Vacuum Polarization in QED with World-Line Methods
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by several recent papers on string-inspired calculations in QED, we
here present our own use of world-line techniques in order to calculate the
vacuum polarization and effective action in scalar and spinor QED with external
arbitrary constant electromagnetic field configuration.
