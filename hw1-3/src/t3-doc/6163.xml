SU(2) WZW D-branes and their non-commutative geometry from DBI action
</title>

<abstract>
  Using properties of the DBI action we find D-branes on $S^3$ of the radius
$Q_5$ corresponding to the conjugacy classes of SU(2). The branes are stable
due to nonzero 2-form NSNS background. In the limit of large $Q_5$ the dynamics
of branes is governed by the non-commutative Yang-Mills theory. The results
partially overlap with those obtained in the recent paper hep-th/0003037.
