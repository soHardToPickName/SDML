<title>
Bound states of 1+1 dimensional field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the bound states of the massive Thirring model. Here, the periodic
boundary condition equations for the Bethe ansatz solutions are numerically
solved. It is found that the massive Thirring model has only one bound state
and the bound state spectrum as the function of the coupling constant agrees
with that of infinite momentum frame prescription by Fujita and Ogura. Boson
boson states (2p$-$2h states) appear only as the continuum spectrum without
making any bound states.
  Further, the finite size correction to the vacuum energy is estimated. The
evaluated central charge is found to be close to unity.
