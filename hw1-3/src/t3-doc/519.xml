<title>
Classical Inhomogeneities in String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize previous work on inhomogeneous pre-big bang cosmology by
including the effect of non-trivial moduli and antisymmetric-tensor/axion
fields. The general quasi-homogeneous asymptotic solution---as one approaches
the big bang singularity from perturbative initial data---is given and its
range of validity is discussed, allowing us to give a general quantitative
estimate of the amount of inflation obtained during the perturbative pre-big
bang era. The question of determining early-time ``attractors'' for generic
pre-big bang cosmologies is also addressed, and a motivated conjecture is
advanced. We also discuss S-duality-related features of the solutions, and
speculate on the way an asymptotic T-duality symmetry may act on moduli space
as one approaches the big bang.
