<title>
Trigonometric R Matrices related to `Dilute' Birman--Wenzl--Murakami
  Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Explicit expressions for three series of $R$ matrices which are related to a
``dilute'' generalisation of the Birman--Wenzl--Murakami are presented. Of
those, one series is equivalent to the quantum $R$ matrices of the
$D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ generalised Toda systems whereas the remaining two series
appear to be new.
