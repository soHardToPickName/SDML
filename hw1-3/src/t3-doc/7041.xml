Path Integral Formulation of Noncommutative Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a phase-space path integral formulation of noncommutative quantum
mechanics, and prove its equivalence to the operatorial formulation. As an
illustration, the partition function of a noncommutative two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator is calculated.
