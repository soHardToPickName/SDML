D5-brane in Anti-de Sitter Space and Penrose Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Penrose limit of the solution of D5-brane given in the
Anti-de Sitter space and analyse the shape of the D5-brane in the pp-wave
background. We find that the D5-brane leads to the branes and the throats
connecting the branes. The branes spread on R^4 with periodic values of the
light-cone time x^+ and the throats lie along x^+. We also give some comments
on holography.
