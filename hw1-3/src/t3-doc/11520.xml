Quantum moduli spaces from matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we show that the matrix model techniques developed by Dijkgraaf
and Vafa can be extended to compute quantum deformed moduli spaces of vacua in
four dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. The examples studied give the
moduli space of a bulk D-brane probe in geometrically engineered theories, in
the presence of fractional branes at singularities.
