<title>
$W_{\infty}$ Algebras and Incompressibility in the Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss how a large class of incompressible quantum Hall states can be
characterized as highest weight states of different representations of the
\Winf algebra. Second quantized expressions of the \Winf generators are
explicitly derived in the cases of multilayer Hall states, the states proposed
by Jain to explain the hierarchical filling fractions and the ones related by
particle-hole conjugation.
