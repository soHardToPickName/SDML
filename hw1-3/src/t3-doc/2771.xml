On the Quantum Moduli Space of M Theory Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the moduli space of M-theories compactified on G_2 manifolds which
are asymptotic to a cone over quotients of S^3 x S^3. We show that the moduli
space is composed of several components, each of which interpolates smoothly
among various classical limits corresponding to low energy gauge theories with
a given number of massless U(1) factors. Each component smoothly interpolates
among supersymmetric gauge theories with different gauge groups.
