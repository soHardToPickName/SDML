<title>
Bosonization of Fermion Determinants
</title>

<abstract>
  A four dimensional fermion determinant is presented as a path integral of the
exponent of a local five dimensional action describing constrained bosonic
system. The construction is carried out both in the continuum theory and in the
lattice model.
