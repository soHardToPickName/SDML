Witten-Veneziano Relation for the Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Witten-Veneziano relation between the topological susceptibility of pure
gauge theories without fermions and the main contribution of the complete
theory and the corresponding formula of Seiler and Stamatescu with the
so-called contact term are discussed for the Schwinger model on a circle. Using
the (Euclidean) path integral and the canonical (Hamiltonian) approaches at
finite temperatures we demonstrate that both formulae give the same result in
the limit of infinite volume and (or) zero temperature.
