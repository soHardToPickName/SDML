<title>
S-Duality in N=4 Yang-Mills Theories with General Gauge Groups,
</title>

<abstract>
't Hooft construction of free energy, electric and magnetic fluxes, and of the
partition function with twisted boundary conditions, is extended to the case of
$N=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories based on arbitrary compact, simple Lie
groups. The transformation of the fluxes and the free energy under S-duality is
presented. We consider the partition function of $N=4$ for a particular choice
of boundary conditions, and compute exactly its leading infrared divergence. We
verify that this partition function obeys the transformation laws required by
S-duality. This provides independent evidence in favor of S-duality in $N=4$
theories.
