<title>
The Structure of Verma Modules over the N=2 Superconformal Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We classify degeneration patterns of Verma modules over the N=2
superconformal algebra in two dimensions. Explicit formulae are given for
singular vectors that generate maximal submodules in each of the degenerate
cases. The mappings between Verma modules defined by these singular vectors are
embeddings; in particular, their compositions never vanish. As a by-product, we
also obtain general formulae for N=2 subsingular vectors.
