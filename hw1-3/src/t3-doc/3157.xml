<title>
An Explicit and Simple Relationship Between Two Model Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  An explicit and simple correspondence, between the basis of the model space
of $SU(3)$ on one hand and that of $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ or $SO(1,3)$ on the
other, is exhibited for the first time. This is done by considering the
generating functions for the basis vectors of these model spaces.
