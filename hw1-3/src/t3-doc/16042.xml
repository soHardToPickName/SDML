On 1/N Corrections to the Entropy of Noncommutative Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study thermodynamical aspects of string theory in the limit in which it
corresponds to Noncommutative Yang-Mills. We confirm, using the AdS/CFT
correspondence, that for general Dp branes the entropy in the planar
approximation depends neither on the value of the background magnetic field B
nor on its rank. We find 1/N corrections to the planar entropy in the WKB
approximation. For all appropriate values of p these corrections are much
softer than the corresponding corrections for the B=0 case, and vanish
altogether in the high temperature limit.
