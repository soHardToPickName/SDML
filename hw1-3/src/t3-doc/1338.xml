On the classical connection between the WZWN model and topological gauge
  theories with boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, at the level of the classical action, that the
Wess-Zumino-Witten-Novikov model is equivalent to a combined BF theory and a
Chern-Simons action in the presence of a unique boundary term. This connection
relies on the techniques of non-Abelian T-duality in non-linear sigma models.
We derive some consistency conditions whose various solutions lead to different
dual theories. Particular attention is paid to the cases of the Lie algebras
SO(2,1) and SO(2,1)*SO(2,1). These are shown to yield three dimensional gravity
only if the BF term is ignored.
