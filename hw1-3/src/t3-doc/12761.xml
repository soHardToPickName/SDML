<title>
Quantum dynamics of $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity compensator
</title>

<abstract>
  A new $N=1$ superfield theory in $D=4$ flat superspace is suggested. It
describes dynamics of supergravity compensator and can be considered as a
low-energy limit for $N=1$, $D=4$ superfield supergravity. The theory is shown
to be renormalizable in infrared limit and infrared free. A quantum effective
action is investigated in infrared domain.
