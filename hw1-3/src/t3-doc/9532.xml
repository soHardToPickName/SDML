Some Exactly Solvable Three-Body Problems in One dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  The three-body problem in one-dimension with a repulsive inverse square
potential between every pair was solved by Calogero. Here, the known results of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics are used to propose a number of new three-body
potentials which can be solved algebraically. Analytic expressions for the
eigenspectrum and the eigenfunctions are given with and without confinement.
