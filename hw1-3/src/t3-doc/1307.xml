Regularisation of non-local actions in two-dimensional field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking the induced action for gauge fields coupled to affine currents as an
example, we show how loop calculations in non-local two-dimensional field
theories can be regulated. Our regularisation method for one loop is based on
the method of Pauli and Villars. We use it to calculate the renormalisation
factors for the corresponding effective actions, clearing up some discrepancies
in the literature. In particular, it will be shown explicitly that vector gauge
transformation invariance and Haar invariance of functional integral measures
impose different requirements, but they are related by a counterterm (which is
local in terms of group variables). For higher loops, we use the method of
covariant derivatives combined with Pauli-Villars to argue that the one loop
result remains unaltered.
