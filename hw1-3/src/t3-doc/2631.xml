Monopoles from Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The relation between defects of Abelian gauges and instantons is discussed
for explicit examples in the Laplacian Abelian gauge. The defect coming from an
instanton is pointlike and becomes a monopole loop with twist upon
perturbation. The interplay between magnetic charge, twist and instanton number
- encoded as a Hopf invariant - is investigated with the help of a new method,
an auxiliary Abelian fibre bundle.
