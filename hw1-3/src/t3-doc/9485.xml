<title>
Dynamical systems accepting the normal shift on an arbitrary Riemannian
  manifold
</title>

<abstract>
  Newtonian dynamical systems which accept the normal shift on an arbitrary
Riemannian manifold are considered. For them the determinating equations making
the weak normality condition are derived. The expansion for the algebra of
tensor fields is constructed.
