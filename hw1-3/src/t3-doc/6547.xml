<title>
Partial Supersymmetry Breaking from Five Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Theories of partial supersymmetry breaking N=2 -> N=1 in four dimensions are
derived by coupling the N=2 massless gravitino multiplet to N=2 supergravity in
five dimensions and performing a generalized dimensional reduction on S^1/Z_2
with the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. These theories agree with results that were
previously derived from four dimensions.
