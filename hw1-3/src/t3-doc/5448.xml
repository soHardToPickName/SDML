Matrix Compactification On Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalizing previous results for orbifolds, in this paper we describe the
compactification of Matrix model on an orientifold which is a quotient space as
a Yang-Mills theory living on a quantum space. The information of the
compactification is encoded in the action of the discrete symmetry group G on
Euclidean space and a projective representation U of G. The choice of Hilbert
space on which the algebra of U is realized as an operator algebra corresponds
to the choice of a physical background for the compactification. All these data
are summarized in the spectral triple of the quantum space.
