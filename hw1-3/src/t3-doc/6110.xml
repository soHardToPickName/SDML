<title>
Five-Dimensional Gauge Theories and Whitham-Toda Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The five-dimensional supersymmetric SU(N) gauge theory is studied in the
framework of the relativistic Toda chain. This equation can be embedded in
two-dimensional Toda lattice hierarchy. This system has the conjugate
structure. This conjugate structure corresponds to the charge conjugation.
