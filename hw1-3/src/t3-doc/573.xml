<title>
Seven Dimensional Octonionic Yang-Mills Instanton and its Extension to
  an Heterotic String Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an octonionic instanton solution to the seven dimensional
Yang-Mills theory based on the exceptional gauge group $G_2$ which is the
automorphism group of the division algebra of octonions. This octonionic
instanton has an extension to a solitonic two-brane solution of the low energy
effective theory of the heterotic string that preserves two of the sixteen
supersymmetries and hence corresponds to $N=1$ space-time supersymmetry in the
(2+1) dimensions transverse to the seven dimensions where the Yang-Mills
instanton is defined.
