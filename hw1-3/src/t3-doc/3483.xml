<title>
Wilson Loops in the Large N Limit at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a proposal of Maldacena we compute in the framework of the supergravity
description of N coincident D3 branes the energy of a quark anti-quark pair in
the large N limit of U(N) N=4 SYM in four dimensions at finite temperature.
