I-Brane Inflow and Anomalous Couplings on D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the anomalous couplings of $D$-brane gauge and gravitational
fields to Ramond-Ramond tensor potentials can be deduced by a simple anomaly
inflow argument applied to intersecting $D$-branes and use this to determine
the eight-form gravitational coupling.
