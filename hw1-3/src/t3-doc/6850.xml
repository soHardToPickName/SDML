Vortices in a nonminimal Maxwell-Chern-Simons O(3) Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we consider an Abelian O(3) sigma model coupled nonminimally
with a gauge field governed by a Maxwell and Chern-Simons terms. Bogomol'nyi
equations are constructed for a specific form of the potential and generic
nonminimal coupling constant. Furthermore, topological and nontopological
self-dual soliton solutions are obtained for a critical value of the nonminimal
coupling constant. Some particular static vortex solutions (topological and
nontopological) satisfying the Bogomol'nyi bound are numerically solved and
presented.
