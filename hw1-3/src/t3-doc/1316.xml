K\"ahler geometry and SUSY mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two examples of SUSY mechanics related with K\"ahler geometry. The
first system is the N=4 supersymmetric one-dimensional sigma-model proposed in
hep-th/0101065. Another system is the N=2 SUSY mechanics whose phase space is
the external algebra of an arbitrary K\"ahler manifold. The relation of these
models with antisymplectic geometry is discussed.
