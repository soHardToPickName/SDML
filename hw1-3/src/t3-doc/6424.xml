Dynamical Aspects of Lie--Poisson Structures
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Groups can be constructed by applying the quantization by deformation
procedure to Lie groups endowed with a suitable Poisson bracket. Here we try to
develop an understanding of these structures by investigating dynamical systems
which are associated with this bracket. We look at $SU(2)$ and $SU(1,1)$, as
submanifolds of a 4--dimensional phase space with constraints, and deal with
two classes of problems. In the first set of examples we consider some
hamiltonian systems associated with Lie-Poisson structures and we investigate
the equations of the motion. In the second set of examples we consider systems
which preserve the chosen bracket, but are dissipative. However in this
approach, they survive the quantization procedure.
