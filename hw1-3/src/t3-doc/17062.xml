<title>
Inhomogeneous Near-extremal Black Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been shown that there exist stable inhomogeneous neutral
black strings in higher dimensional gravity. These solutions were motivated by
the fact that the corresponding homogeneous solutions are unstable. We show
that there exist new inhomogeneous black string and black p-brane solutions
even when the corresponding translationally invariant solutions are stable. In
particular, we show there exist inhomogeneous near-extremal black strings and
p-branes. Some of these solutions remain inhomogeneous even when the size of
the compact direction (at infinity) is very small.
