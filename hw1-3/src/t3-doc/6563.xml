<title>
Generalized geometries and kinematics for Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Our proposal here is to set up the conceptual framework for an eventual
{Theory of Everything}.
  We formulate the arena -language- to build up {\it any} QG. In particular, we
show how the objects of fundamental theories, such as p-branes (strings, loops
and others) could be posed in this language.
