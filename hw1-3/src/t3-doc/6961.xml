Comments on `Existence of axially symmetric solutions in SU(2)-Yang
  Mills and related theories [hep-th/9907222]'
</title>

<abstract>
  In [hep-th/9907222] Hannibal claims to exclude the existence of particle-like
static axially symmetric non-abelian solutions in SU(2)
Einstein-Yang-Mills-dilaton theory. His argument is based on the asymptotic
behaviour of such solutions. Here we disprove his claim by giving explicitly
the asymptotic form of non-abelian solutions with winding number n=2.
