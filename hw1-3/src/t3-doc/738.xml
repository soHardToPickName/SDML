On the relationship of gravitational constants in KK reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short note, we try to clarify a seemly trivial but often confusing
question in relating a higher-dimensional physical gravitational constant to
its lower-dimensional correspondence in Kaluza-Klein reduction. In particular,
we re-derive the low-energy M-theory gravitational constant in terms of type
IIA string coupling $g_s$ and constant $\alpha'$ through the metric relation
between the two theories.
