Phase Transition in Gauge Theories and Multiple Point Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present paper the phase transition in the regularized U(1) gauge
theory is investigated using the dual Abelian Higgs model of scalar monopoles.
The corresponding renormalization group improved effective potential, analogous
to the Coleman-Weinberg's one, was considered in the two-loop approximation for
$\beta$ functions, and the phase transition (critical) dual and non-dual
couplings were calculated in the U(1) gauge theory. It was shown that the
critical value of the renormalized electric fine structure constant
$\alpha_{\text{crit}}\approx 0.208$ obtained in this paper coincides with the
lattice result for compact QED: $\alpha_{\text{crit}}^{\text{lat}}\approx
0.20\pm 0.015$. This result and the behavior of $\alpha$ in the vicinity of the
phase transition point were compared with the Multiple Point Model prediction
for the values of $\alpha$ near the Planck scale. Such a comparison is very
encouraging for the Multiple Point Model assuming the existence of the multiple
critical point at the Planck scale.
