SU(2) Gauge Theory in Covariant (Maximal) Abelian Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  The local covariant continuum action of an SU(2) gauge theory in covariant
Abelian gauges is investigated. It describes the critical limit of an Abelian
Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with an equivariant BRST-symmetry. This Abelian LGT
has previously been proven to be physically equivalent to the SU(2)-LGT.
Renormalizability requires a quartic ghost interaction in these nonlinear
gauges (also in maximal Abelian gauge). Arguments that a certain global SL(2,R)
symmetry is dynamically broken by ghost-antighost condensation in a BCS-like
mechanism are presented. The scenario can be viewed as a dynamical Higgs
mechanism in the adjoint that gives massive off-diagonal gluons and a BRST
quartet of Goldstone bosonsthat decouples from physical observables. The gap
parameter is related to the expectation value of the trace anomaly and the
consistency of this scenario with the Operator Product Expansion is discussed.
