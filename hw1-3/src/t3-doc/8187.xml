<title>
Logarithmic Operators in the Theory of Plateau Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that $SL(2;C)/SU(2)$ model which had been recently proposed to
describe the behaviour of the local densities of states at the plateau
transition in Integer Quantum Hall effect, has logarithmic operators. They
unusual properties are studied in this letter.
