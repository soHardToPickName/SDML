<title>
Constrained Dynamics of the Coupled Abelian Two-Form
</title>

<abstract>
  I present the reduction of phase space of the theory of an antisymmetric
tensor potential coupled to an abelian gauge field, using Dirac's procedure.
Duality transformations on the reduced phase space are also discussed.
