Some Issues in Non-commutative Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  Techniques of non-commutative field theories have proven to be useful in
describing D-branes as tachyonic solitons in open string theory. However, this
procedure also leads to unwanted degeneracy of solutions not present in the
spectrum of D-branes in string theories. In this paper we explore the
possibility that this apparent multiplicity of solutions is due to the wrong
choice of variables in describing the solutions, and that with the correct
choice of variables the unwanted degeneracy disappears.
