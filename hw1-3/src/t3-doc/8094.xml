<title>
Area-preserving structure of 2d-gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action for 2d-gravity with manifest area-preserving invariance
is obtained in the flat and in the general gravitational background. The
cocyclic properties of the last action are proved, and generalizations on
higher dimensions are discussed.
