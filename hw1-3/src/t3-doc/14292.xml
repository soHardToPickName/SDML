<title>
Rotated Branes and N=1 Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider configurations of rotated NS-branes leading to a family of
four-dimensional N=1 super-QCD theories, interpolating between four-dimensional
analogues of the Hanany-Witten vacua, and the Elitzur-Giveon-Kutasov
configuration for N=1 duality. The rotation angle is the N=2 breaking
parameter, the mass of the adjoint scalar in the N=2 vector multiplet. We add
some comments on the relevance of these configurations as possible stringy
proofs of N=1 duality.
