<title>
Massless Higher Spin Fields in the AdS Background and BRST Constructions
  for Nonlinear Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The detailed description of the method of the construction of the nilpotent
BRST charges for nonlinear algebras of constraints appearing in the description
of the massless higher spin fields on the $AdS_D$ background is presented. It
is shown that the corresponding BRST charge is not uniquely defined, but this
ambiguity has no impact on the physical content of the theory.
