<title>
A Non-Technical Introduction to Confinement and N=2 Globally
  Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of this talk is to give a brief introduction to the problem of
confinement in QCD and to N=2 globally supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories
(SYM). While avoiding technicalities as much as possible I will try to
emphasize the physical ideas which lie behind the picture of confinement as a
consequence of the vacua of QCD to be a dual superconductor. Finally I review
the implementation of this picture in the framework of N=2 SYM.
