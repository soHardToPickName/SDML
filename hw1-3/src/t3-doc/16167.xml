<title>
The d=6, N=1 heterotic string does not "live" in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss why the N_6=1 heterotic string has to be viewed as something
similar to a ``non-compact orbifold''. Only the perturbative spectrum is forced
to satisfy the constraints imposed by the vanishing of six-dimensional
anomalies. These do not apply to the states of the non-perturbative spectrum,
such as those appearing when small instantons shrink to zero size.
