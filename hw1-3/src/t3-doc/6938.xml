<title>
D-particle bound states and the D-instanton measure
</title>

<abstract>
  A connection is made between the Witten index of relevance to threshold bound
states of D-particles in the type IIA superstring theory and the measure that
enters D-instanton sums for processes dominated by single multiply-charged
D-instantons in the type IIB theory.
