<title>
Abelian and Non-Abelian Dualities in String Bacgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief discussion of recent work on duality symmetries in
non-trivial string backgrounds. Duality is obtained from a gauged non-linear
sigma-model with vanishing gauge field strength. Standard results are
reproduced for abelian gauge groups, whereas a new type of duality is
identified for non--abelian gauge groups. Examples of duals of WZW models and
4-d black holes are given. (Presented at `From Superstrings to Supergravity',
