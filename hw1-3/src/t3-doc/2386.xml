On the Equivalence of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons Theory and a Self-Dual
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the connection between the Green functions of the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and a self-dual model by starting from the
phase-space path integral representation of the Deser-Jackiw master Lagrangian.
Their equivalence is established modulo time-ordering ambiguities.
