Chiral Supergravitons Interacting with a 0-Brane N-Extended NSR
  Super-Virasoro Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue the development of the actions, S_{AFF}, by examining the cases
where there are N fermionic degrees of freedom associated with a 0-brane. These
actions correspond to the interaction of the N-extended super Virasoro algebra
with the supergraviton and the associated SO(N) gauge field that accompanies
the supermultiplet. The superfield formalism is used throughout so that
supersymmetry is explicit.
