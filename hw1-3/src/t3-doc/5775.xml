<title>
The Confining String from the Soft Dilaton Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  A candidate for the confining string of gauge theories is constructed via a
representation of the ultraviolet divergences of quantum field theory by a
closed string dilaton insertion, computed through the soft dilaton theorem. The
resulting (critical) confining string is conformally invariant, singles out
naturally $d=4$ dimensions, and can not be used to represent theories with
Landau poles.
