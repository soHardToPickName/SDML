Evaluation of Observables in the Gaussian $N=\infty$ Kazakov-Migdal
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the properties of observables in the Kazakov-Migdal model. We
present explicit formulae for the leading asymptotics of adjoint Wilson loops
as well as some other observables for the model with a Gaussian potential. We
discuss the phase transiton in the large $N$ limit of the $d=1$ model. One of
appendices is devoted to discussion of the $N =\infty$ Itzykson-Zuber integrals
for arbitrary eigenvalue densities.
