<title>
What is Special K\"ahler Geometry ?
</title>

<abstract>
  The scalars in vector multiplets of N=2 supersymmetric theories in 4
dimensions exhibit `special Kaehler geometry', related to duality symmetries,
due to their coupling to the vectors. In the literature there is some confusion
on the definition of special geometry. We show equivalences of some definitions
and give examples which show that earlier definitions are not equivalent, and
are not sufficient to restrict the Kaehler metric to one that occurs in N=2
supersymmetry. We treat the rigid as well as the local supersymmetry case. The
connection is made to moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces and Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
The conditions for the existence of a prepotential translate to a condition on
the choice of canonical basis of cycles.
