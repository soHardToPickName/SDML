Monte Carlo Studies of the Dimensionally Reduced 4d SU(N) Super
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We simulate a supersymmetric matrix model obtained from dimensional reduction
of 4d SU(N) super Yang-Mills theory. The model is well defined for finite N and
it is found that the large N limit obtained by keeping g^2 N fixed gives rise
to well defined operators which represent string amplitudes. The space-time
structure which arises dynamically from the eigenvalues of the bosonic matrices
is discussed, as well as the effect of supersymmetry on the dynamical
properties of the model. Eguchi-Kawai equivalence of this model to ordinary
gauge theory does hold within a finite range of scale. We report on new
simulations of the bosonic model for N up to 768 that confirm this property,
which comes as a surprise since no quenching or twist is introduced.
