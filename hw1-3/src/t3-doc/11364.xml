<title>
Quantum $\kappa$-Poincare in Any Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The $\kappa$-deformation of the D-dimensional Poincar\'e algebra $(D\geq 2)$
with any signature is given. Further the quadratic Poisson brackets, determined
by the classical $r$-matrix are calculated, and the quantum Poincar\'e group
"with noncommuting parameters" is obtained.
