Quantum Dynamics from Classical Dissipative Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the quantized non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained as the
infrared limit of the corresponding classical gauge theory in a higher
dimension. We show how the transformation from classical to quantum dynamics
emerges and calculate Planck's constant from quantities defined in the
underlying classical field theory.
