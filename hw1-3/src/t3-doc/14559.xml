<title>
Anti-de Sitter gravity associated with the supergroup $SU(1,1|2)\times
  SU(1,1|2)$
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the anti-de Sitter supergravity in three dimensions associated
with the supergroup $SU(1,1|2)\times SU(1,1|2)$. The field content and the
action are inferred using the fact that $AdS$ supergravity theories in three
dimensions are Chern-Simons theories.
