<title>
Vector Multiplets and the Phases of N = 2 Theories in 2D Through the
  Looking Glass
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend Witten's discussion of actions related to the Landau-Ginzburg
description of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces to cover
the mirror class of models that include twisted chiral matter multiplets and a
newly discovered 2D, N = 2 twisted vector multiplet. Certain integrability
obstructions are observed that constrain the most general constructions
containing both matter and twisted matter simultaneously. It is conjectured
that knot invariants will ultimately play a role in describing the most general
such model.
