<title>
New N=2 Superconformal Field Theories in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  New examples of N=2 supersymmetric conformal field theories are found as
fixed points of SU(2) N=2 supersymmetric QCD. Relations among the scaling
dimensions of their relevant chiral operators, global symmetries, and Higgs
branches are understood in terms of the general structure of relevant
deformations of non-trivial N=2 conformal field theories. The spectrum of
scaling dimensions found are all those compatible with relevant deformations of
a y^2 = x^3 singular curve.
