<title>
Exact solution of double-delta function Bose gas through interacting
  anyon gas
</title>

<abstract>
  1d Bose gas interacting through delta, delta' and double-delta function
potentials is shown to be equivalent to a delta anyon gas allowing exact Bethe
ansatz solution. In the noninteracting limit it describes an ideal gas with
generalized exclusion statistics and solves some recent controversies.
