<title>
The polarization of M5 branes and little string theories with reduced
  supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an M-theory dual of a 6 dimensional little string theory with
reduced supersymmetry, along the lines of Polchinski and Strassler. We find
that upon perturbing the (2,0) theory with an R-current, the M5 branes polarize
into a wrapped Kaluza Klein monopole, whose isometry direction is along the R
current. We investigate the properties of this theory.
