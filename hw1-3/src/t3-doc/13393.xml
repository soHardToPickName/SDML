<title>
A Note on Non-Locality and Ostrogradski's Construction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Hamiltonian treatment of non-local theories and
Ostrogradski's formalism. This has recently also been discussed by Woodard
(hep-th/0006207) and by Gomis, Kamimura and Llosa (hep-th/0006235). In our
approach we recast the second class constraints into first class constraints
and invoke the boundary Poisson bracket.
