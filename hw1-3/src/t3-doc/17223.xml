<title>
Symmetry Breaking of Gauge Theories via Internal Space Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, I explain how gauge symmetry can be broken in a geometric way,
\`{a} la Kaluza-Klein. In higher dimensional gravitational theories, one
usually considers the extra dimensions to be ``frozen'' in time. However, the
internal manifold is actually a dynamic entity. For example, its metric can
change even if one expects its topological properties to be invariant. It is
conceivable then, that at an earlier epoch the internal manifold made a
geometric transition from say a maximally symmetric metric space to a less
symmetric one. We know in a Kaluza-Klein reduction scheme, the massless gauge
bosons are associated with the Killing vectors of the internal manifold. After
the transition of the internal manifold, the gauge bosons associated with the
broken Killing isometries will pick up a mass thereby breaking the gauge
invariance partially. In this paper, I explore this idea, work out the mass of
broken gauge bosons for some simple examples, and also point out how a
mechanism similar to that of Higgs may be at work.
