<title>
The singleton action action from the supermembrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the free Osp(8|4) singleton action by sending the M2brane to the
Minkowski boundary of an AdS_4x{\cal M}_7 background. We do this by means of
the solvable Lie algebra parametrization of the coset space. We also give some
comments on singleton actions from membranes on AdS_4xG/H backgrounds.
