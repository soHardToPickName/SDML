<title>
Further solutions of critical ABF RSOS models
</title>

<abstract>
  The restricted SOS model of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester has been studied.
The finite size corrections to the eigenvalue spectra of the transfer matrix of
the model with a more general crossing parameter have been calculated.
Therefore the conformal weights and the central charges of the non-unitary or
unitary minimal conformal field have been extracted from the finite size
corrections.
