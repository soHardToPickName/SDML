Bogomol'nyi Bounds and Killing Spinors in d=3 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the connection between the construction of Bogomol'nyi bounds and
equations in three dimensional gravitational theories and the existence of an
underlying $N=2$ local supersymmetric structure. We show that, appart from
matter self duality equations, a first order equation for the gravitational
field (whose consistency condition gives the Einstein equation) can be written
as a consequence of the local supersymmetry. Its solvability makes possible the
evasion of the no-go scenario for the construction of Killing spinors in
asymptotically conical spacetimes. In particular we show that the existence of
non-trivial supercovariantly constant spinors is guaranteed whenever field
configurations saturate the topological bound.
