On the Duality between the Heterotic String and F-Theory in 8 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we compare the moduli spaces of the heterotic string
compactified on a two-torus and F-Theory compactified on an elliptic K3 surface
for the case of an unbroken E8 x E8 gauge group. The explicit map relating the
deformation parameters alpha and beta of the F-Theory K3 surface to the moduli
T and U of the heterotic torus is found using the close relationship between
the K3 discriminant and the discriminant of the Calabi-Yau-threefold
X(1,1,2,8,12)[24] in the limit of a large base P1.
