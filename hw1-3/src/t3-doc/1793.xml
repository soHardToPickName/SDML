<title>
On amplitudes in self-dual sector of Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Self-dual perturbiner in the Yang-Mills theory is constructed by the twistor
methods both in topologically trivial and topologically nontrivial cases.
Maximally helicity violating amplitudes and their instanton induced analogies
are briefly discussed.
