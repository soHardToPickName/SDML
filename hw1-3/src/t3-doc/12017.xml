<title>
Physical States in Topological Phase of N=2 Supersymmetric WZNW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  N=2 supersymmetric WZNW models associated with finite-dimensional Manin
triples is considered. Physical states in topological phase of these models are
computed and them N=2 WZNW representatives are constracted. Ring structure of
the physical states is computed.
