<title>
Simple Evaluation of the Chiral Jacobian with the Overlap Dirac Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  The chiral Jacobian, which is defined with Neuberger's overlap Dirac operator
of the lattice fermion, is explicitly evaluated in the continuum limit without
expanding it in the gauge coupling constant. Our calculational scheme is simple
and straightforward. We determine a coefficient of the chiral anomaly for
general values of the mass parameter and the Wilson parameter of the overlap
Dirac operator.
