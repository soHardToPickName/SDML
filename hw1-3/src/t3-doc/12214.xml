<title>
Cosmological constant in broken maximal sugras
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the form of the cosmological constant in the loop expansion of
broken maximally supersymmetric supergravity theories, and after embedding,
within superstring and M-theory. Supersymmetry breaking at the TeV scale
generates values of the cosmological constant that are in agreement with
current astrophysical data. The form of perturbative quantum effects in the
loop expansion is consistent with this parameter regime.
