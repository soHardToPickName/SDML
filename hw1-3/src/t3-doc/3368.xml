<title>
Four-dimensional gravity on a thick domain wall
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an especially simple version of a thick domain wall in $AdS$
space and investigate how four-dimensional gravity arises in this context. The
model we consider has the advantage, that the equivalent quantum mechanics
problem can be stated in closed form. The potential in this Schr\"odinger
equation suggests that there could be resonances in the spectrum of the
continuum modes. We demonstrate that there are no such resonances in the model
we consider.
