<title>
The phase diagram for the $(\lambda \phi ^{4}+\sigma \phi ^{2})_{2}$
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  The two parameter model is reduced to a one parameter model by using simple
transformations. Because the separation between different phase regions for a
one parameter model is just a point, the equivalence between the two models
leads to the exact equation of the line that separates the broken and un-broken
phases in the $(\lambda ,\sigma)$ plane. Also, we obtain nontrivial estimates
on the stability region for this model.
