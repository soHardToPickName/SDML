The Critical Exponents Of The Matrix Valued Gross-Neveu Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the large N limit of the MATRIX valued Gross-Neveu model in 2<d<4
dimensions. The method employed is a combination of the approximate recursion
formula of Polyakov and Wilson with the solution to the zero dimensional large
N counting problem of Makeenko and Zarembo. The model is found to have a phase
transition at a finite value for the critical temperature and the critical
exponents are approximated by nu = 1/(2(d-2)) and eta=d-2. We test the validity
of the approximation by applying it to the usual vector models where it is
found to yield exact results to leading order in 1/N.
