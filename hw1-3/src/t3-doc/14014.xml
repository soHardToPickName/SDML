<title>
A Geometric Algorithm to construct new solitons in the O(3) Nonlinear
  Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The O(3) nonlinear sigma model with boundary, in dimension two, is
considered. An algorithm to determine all its soliton solutions that preserve a
rotational symmetry in the boundary is exhibited. This nonlinear problem is
reduced to that of clamped elastica in a hyperbolic plane. These solutions
carry topological charges that can be holographically determined from the
boundary conditions. As a limiting case, we give a wide family of new soliton
solutions in the free O(3) nonlinear sigma model.
