DBI Action from Closed Strings and D-brane second Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Brane-like vertex operators play an important role in a worldsheet
formulation of D-branes and M-theory. In this paper we derive the DBI D-brane
action from NSR closed string sigma-model with brane-like states. We also show
that these operators carry RR charges and define D-brane wavefunctions in a
second quantized formalism.
