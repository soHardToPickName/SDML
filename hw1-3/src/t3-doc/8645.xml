<title>
The Weingarten Model a la Polyakov
</title>

<abstract>
  The Weingarten lattice gauge model of Nambu-Goto strings is generalised to
allow for fluctuations of an intrinsic worldsheet metric through a dynamical
quadrilation. The continuum limit is taken for $c\leq1$ matter, reproducing the
results of hermitian matrix models to all orders in the genus expansion. For
the compact $c=1$ case the vortices are Wilson lines, whose exclusion leads to
the theory of non-interacting fermions. As a by-product of the analysis one
finds the critical behaviour of SOS and vertex models coupled to 2D quantum
gravity.
