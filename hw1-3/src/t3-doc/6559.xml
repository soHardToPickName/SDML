<title>
Algebraic and geometric aspects of generalized quantum dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  \noindent We briefly discuss some algebraic and geometric aspects of the
generalized Poisson bracket and non--commutative phase space for generalized
quantum dynamics, which are analogous to properties of the classical Poisson
bracket and ordinary symplectic structure.
