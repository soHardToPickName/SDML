su(3)k fusion coefficients
</title>

<abstract>
  A closed and explicit formula for all $\su{(3)}_k$ fusion coefficients is
presented which, in the limit $k \rightarrow \infty$, turns into a simple and
compact expression for the $su(3)$ tensor product coefficients. The derivation
is based on a new diagrammatic method which gives directly both tensor product
and fusion coefficients.
