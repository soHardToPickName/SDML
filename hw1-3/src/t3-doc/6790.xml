Exotic tensor gauge theory and duality
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauge fields in exotic representations of the Lorentz group in D dimensions -
i.e. ones which are tensors of mixed symmetry corresponding to Young tableaux
with arbitrary numbers of rows and columns - naturally arise through massive
string modes and in dualising gravity and other theories in higher dimensions.
We generalise the formalism of differential forms to allow the discussion of
arbitrary gauge fields. We present the gauge symmetries, field strengths, field
equations and actions for the free theory, and construct the various dual
theories. In particular, we discuss linearised gravity in arbitrary dimensions,
and its two dual forms.
