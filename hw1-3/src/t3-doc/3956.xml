<title>
Energy-momentum Tensors in Matrix Theory and in Noncommutative Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The energy-momentum tensor of Matrix Theory is derived by computing disk
amplitudes with one closed string and an arbitrary number of open strings and
by taking the DKPS limit. We clarify its relation to the energy-momentum tensor
of the noncommutative gauge theory derived in our previous paper.
