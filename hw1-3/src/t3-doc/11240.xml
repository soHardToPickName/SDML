Algebraic-geometrical n-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems and
  solutions to the associativity equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Algebraic-geometrical n-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems in a flat
space are constructed. They are expressed in terms of the Riemann theta
function of auxiliary algebraic curves. The exact formulae for the potentials
of algebraic geometrical Egoroff metrics and the partition functions of the
corresponding topological field theories are obtained.
