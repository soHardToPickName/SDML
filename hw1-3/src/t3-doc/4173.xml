<title>
Supersymmetric black hole solutions with $R^2$-interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of static supersymmetric multi-center black hole solutions
arising in four-dimensional N=2 supergravity theories with terms quadratic in
the Weyl tensor. We also comment on possible corrections to the metric on the
moduli space of these black holes solutions.
