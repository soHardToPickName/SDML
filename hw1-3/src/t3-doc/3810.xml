<title>
Radiative Corrections in Nonrelativistic Chern-Simons Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the one-loop scalar field effective potential for the $N=2$
supersymmetric nonrelativistic self-interacting matter fields coupled to an
Abelian Chern-Simons gauge field and for its generalization when bosonic matter
fields are coupled to non-Abelian Chern-Simons field. In both models, Gauss's
law linearly relates the magnetic field to the matter field densities; hence,
we also include radiative effects from the background gauge field. We compute
the scalar field effective potentials in two gauge families, a gauge
reminiscent of the $R_\xi$-gauge in the limit $\xi\rightarrow 0$ and in the
Coulomb family gauges. We regularize the theory with operator regularization
and a cutoff to demonstrate that the results are independent of the
regularization scheme.
