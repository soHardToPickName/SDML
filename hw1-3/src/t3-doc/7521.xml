<title>
A Manifestly Gauge-Invariant Approach to Quantum Theories of Gauge
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  In gauge theories, physical histories are represented by space-time
connections modulo gauge transformations. The space of histories is thus
intrinsically non-linear. The standard framework of constructive quantum field
theory has to be extended to face these {\it kinematical} non-linearities
squarely. We first present a pedagogical account of this problem and then
suggest an avenue for its resolution.
