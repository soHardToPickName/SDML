<title>
Tunneling between fermionic vacua and the overlap formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  The probability amplitude for tunneling between the Dirac vacua corresponding
to different signs of a parity breaking fermionic mass $M$ in $2+1$ dimensions
is studied, making contact with the continuum overlap formulation for chiral
determinants. It is shown that the transition probability in the limit when $M
\to \infty$ corresponds, via the overlap formalism, to the squared modulus of a
chiral determinant in two Euclidean dimensions. The transition probabilities
corresponding to two particular examples: fermions on a torus with twisted
boundary conditions, and fermions on a disk in the presence of an external
constant magnetic field are evaluated.
