Monopoles in Quantum Corrected N=2 Super Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of N=2 super Yang-Mills
theories. We find that the BPS equations are unchanged outside a quantum core
where higher dimension contributions are expected to be important. We find two
quantum generalizations of the BPS soliton. The leading higher-derivative
correction to the effective action is shown not to contribute to the BPS mass
formula.
