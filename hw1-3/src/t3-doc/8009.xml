New Standard Model Vacua from Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new D6-brane model vacua (non-supersymmetric) that have at low
energy exactly the standard model spectrum (with right handed neutrinos). The
minimal version of these models requires five stacks of branes. and the
construction is based on D6-branes intersecting at angles in $D = 4$ type
toroidal orientifolds of type I strings. Three U(1)'s become massive through
their couplings to RR couplings and from the two surviving anomaly free U(1)'s,
one is the standard model hypercharge generator while the extra anomaly free
U(1) could be broken from its non-zero couplings to RR fields and also by
triggering a vev to previously massive particles. We suggest that extra
massless U(1)'s should be broken by requiring some intersection to respect N=1
supersymmetry thus supporting the appearance of massless charged singlets at
the supersymmetric intersection. Proton is stable as baryon number is gauged
and its anomalies are cancelled through a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism.
Neutrinos are of Dirac type with small masses, as in the four stack standard
models of hep-th/0105155, as a result of the existence of a similar PQ
like-symmetry. The models are unique in the sense that they predict the
existence of only one supersymmetric particle, the superpartner of $\nu_R$.
