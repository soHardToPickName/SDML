Environmentally Friendly Renormalization Group and Phase Transitions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss an environmentally friendly renormalization group approach to
analyze phase transitions. We intend to apply this method to the Electroweak
Phase Transition. This work is in progress. We present some previously obtained
results concerning a scalar theory, where the main features of this algorithm
are introduced.
