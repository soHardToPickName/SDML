Chaos-Order Transition in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical dynamics in SU(2) Matrix theory is investigated. A classical
chaos-order transition is found. For the angular momentum small enough (even
for small coupling constant) the system exhibits a chaotic behavior, for
angular momentum large enough the system is regular.
