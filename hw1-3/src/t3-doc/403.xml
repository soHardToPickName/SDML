Lienard-Wiechert Potentials in Even Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The motion of point charged particles is considered in an even dimensional
Minkowski space-time. The potential functions corresponding to the massless
scalar and the Maxwell fields are derived algorithmically. It is shown that in
all even dimensions particles lose energy due to acceleration.
