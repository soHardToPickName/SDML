The UV and IR Origin of Nonabelian Chiral Gauge Anomalies on
  Noncommutative Minkowski Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss both the UV and IR origin of the one-loop triangle gauge anomalies
for noncommutative nonabelian chiral gauge theories with fundamental, adjoint
and bi-fundamental fermions for U(N) groups. We find that gauge anomalies only
come from planar triangle diagrams, the non-planar triangle contributions
giving rise to no breaking of the Ward identies. Generally speaking, theories
with fundamental and bi-fundamental chiral matter are anomalous. Theories with
only adjoint chiral fermions are anomaly free.
