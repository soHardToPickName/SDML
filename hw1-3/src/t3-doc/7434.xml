<title>
Symplectic structure of the moduli space of flat connections on a
  Riemann surface
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider canonical symplectic structure on the moduli space of flat
${\g}$-connections on a Riemann surface of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points.
For ${\g}$ being a semisimple Lie algebra we obtain an explicit efficient
formula for this symplectic form and prove that it may be represented as a sum
of $n$ copies of Kirillov symplectic form on the orbit of dressing
transformations in the Poisson-Lie group $G^{*}$ and $g$ copies of the
symplectic structure on the Heisenberg double of the Poisson-Lie group $G$ (the
pair ($G,G^{*}$) corresponds to the Lie algebra ${\g}$).
