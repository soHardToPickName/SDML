Bogomol'nyi Bounds and the Supersymmetric Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study N=2 supersymmetric Born-Infeld-Higgs theory in 3 dimensions and
derive Bogomol'nyi relations in its bosonic sector. A peculiar coupling between
the Higgs and the gauge field (with dynamics determined by the Born-Infeld
action) is forced by supersymmetry. The resulting equations coincide with those
arising in the Maxwell-Higgs model. Concerning Bogomol'nyi bounds for the
vortex energy, they are derived from the N=2 supersymmetry algebra.
