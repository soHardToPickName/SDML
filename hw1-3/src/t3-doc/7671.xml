ONE-LOOP QUANTUM CORRECTIONS TO THE ENTROPY FOR A 4-DIMENSIONAL ETERNAL
  BLACK HOLE,
</title>

<abstract>
ABSTRACT: The first quantum corrections to the free energy for an eternal
4-dimensional black hole is investigated at one-loop level, in the large mass
limit of the black hole, making use of the conformal techniques related to the
optical metric. The quadratic and logarithmic divergences as well as a finite
part associated with the first quantum correction to the entropy are obtained
at a generic temperature. It is argued that, at the Hawking temperature, the
horizon divergences of the internal energy should cancel. Some comments on the
divergences of the entropy are also presented.
