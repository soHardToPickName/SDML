<title>
Two-loop Yang-Mills theory in the world-line formalism and an
  Euler-Heisenberg type action
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of the world-line formalism we write down in detail a
two-loop Euler-Heisenberg type action for gluon loops in Yang-Mills theory and
discuss its divergence structure. We exactly perform all the world-line moduli
integrals at two loops by inserting a mass parameter, and then extract
divergent coefficients to be renormalized.
