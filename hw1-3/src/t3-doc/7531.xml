<title>
A D2-brane realization of Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that N=2 supersymmetric Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs systems in three
dimension can be realized as gauge theories on a D2-brane in D8-branes
background with a non-zero B-field. We reproduce a potential of Coulomb branch
of the Chern-Simons theory as a potential of a D2-brane in a classical D8-brane
solution and show that each Coulomb vacuum is realized by a D2-brane stabilized
in the bulk at a certain distance from D8-branes.
