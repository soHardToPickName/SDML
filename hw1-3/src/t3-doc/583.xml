Confinement in three dimensional magnetic monopole--dipole gas
</title>

<abstract>
  Confinement of electrically charged test particles in the dilute plasma of
monopoles and pointlike magnetic dipoles is studied. We calculate the tension
of the string emerging between the infinitely separated test particles. The
string tension is an increasing function of the dipole density provided other
parameters of the plasma are fixed. The relevance of our results to confining
gauge theories is discussed.
