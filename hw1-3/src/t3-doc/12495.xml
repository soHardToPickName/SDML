Finite Temperature Correlation Functions in Integrable QFT
</title>

<abstract>
  Finite temperature correlation functions in integrable quantum field theories
are formulated only in terms of the usual, temperature-independent form
factors, and certain thermodynamic filling fractions which are determined from
the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Explicit expressions are given for the one and
two-point functions.
