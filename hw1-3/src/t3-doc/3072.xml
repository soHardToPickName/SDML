<title>
Vacuum polarization and the geometric phase: Gauge invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonperturbative approach to the vacuum polarization for quantized fermions
in external vector potentials is discussed. It is shown that by a suitable
choice of counterterms the vacuum polarization phase is both gauge and
renormalization independent, within a large class of nonperturbative
renormalizations.
