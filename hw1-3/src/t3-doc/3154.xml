Charges in Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we investigate charged particles in gauge theories. After
reviewing the physical and theoretical problems, a method to construct charged
particles is presented. Explicit solutions are found in the Abelian theory and
a physical interpretation is given. These solutions and our interpretation of
these variables as the true degrees of freedom for charged particles, are then
tested in the perturbative domain and are demonstrated to yield infra-red
finite, on-shell Green's functions at all orders of perturbation theory. The
extension to collinear divergences is studied and it is shown that this method
applies to the case of massless charged particles. The application of these
constructions to the charged sectors of the standard model is reviewed and we
conclude with a discussion of the successes achieved so far in this programme
and a list of open questions.
