A Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson Realizations for the Lie Superalgebra
  gl(m/n+1)
</title>

<abstract>
  The known Holstein-Primakoff and Dyson realizations for the Lie algebras
$gl(n+1),\;n=1,2,\ldots$ in terms of Bose operators are generalized to the
class of the Lie superalgebras $gl(m/n+1)$ for any $n$ and $m$. Formally the
expressions are the same as for $gl(m+n+1)$, however both Bose and Fermi
operators are involved.
