<title>
Multidimensional Calogero systems from matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a particular many-matrix model gives rise, upon hamiltonian
reduction, to a multidimensional version of the Calogero-Sutherland model and
its spin generalizations. Some simple solutions of these models are
demonstrated by solving the corresponding matrix equations. A connection of
this model to the dimensional reduction of Yang-Mills theories to
(0+1)-dimensions is pointed out. In particular, it is shown that the low-energy
dynamics of D0-branes in sectors with nontrivial fermion content is that of
spin-Calogero particles.
