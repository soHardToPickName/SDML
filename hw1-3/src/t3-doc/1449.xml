Branes and Toric Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that toric geometry can be used rather effectively to translate a
brane configuration to geometry. Roughly speaking the skeletons of toric space
are identified with the brane configurations. The cases where the local
geometry involves hypersurfaces in toric varieties (such as P^2 blown up at
more than 3 points) presents a challenge for the brane picture. We also find a
simple physical explanation of Batyrev's construction of mirror pairs of
Calabi-Yau manifolds using T-duality.
