Anatomy of One-Loop Effective Action in Noncommutative Scalar Field
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  One-loop effective action of noncommutative scalar field theory with cubic
self-interaction is studied. Utilizing worldline formulation, both planar and
nonplanar part of the effective action are computed explicitly. We find
complete agreement of the result with Seiberg-Witten limit of string worldsheet
computation and standard Feynman diagrammatics. We prove that, at low-energy
and large noncommutativity limit, nonplanar part of the effective action is
simplified enormously and is resummable into a quadratic action of scalar open
Wilson line operators.
