<title>
A spinor-like representation of the contact superconformal algebra K'(4)
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we construct an embedding of a nontrivial central extension of
the contact superconformal algebra K'(4) into the Lie superalgebra of
pseudodifferential symbols on the supercircle S^{1|2}. Associated with this
embedding is a one-parameter family of spinor-like tiny irreducible
representations of K'(4) realized just on 4 fields instead of the usual 16.
