On Deriving Space-Time From Quantum Observables and States
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that, under suitable assumptions, operationally motivated data
completely determine a space-time in which the quantum systems can be
interpreted as evolving. At the same time, the dynamics of the quantum system
is also determined. To minimize technical complications, this is done in the
example of three-dimensional Minkowski space.
