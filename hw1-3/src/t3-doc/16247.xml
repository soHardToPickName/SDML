String Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief review of recent advances in string cosmology. Starting
with the Dilaton-Moduli Cosmology (known also as the Pre Big Bang), we go on to
include the effects of axion fields and address the thorny issue of the
Graceful Exit in String Cosmology. This is followed by a review of density
perturbations arising in string cosmology and we finish with a brief
introduction to the impact moving five branes can have on the Dilaton-Moduli
cosmological solutions.
