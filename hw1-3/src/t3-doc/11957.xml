R-matrices of U_qOSP(1,2) for highest weight representations of
  U_qOSP(1,2) for general q and q is an odd root of unity
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the formula for intertwining operator(R-matrix) of quantum
universal enveloping superalgebra U_qOSP(1,2) for U_qOSP(1,2)-Verma modules. By
its restriction we obtain the R-matrix for two semiperiodic(semicyclic), two
spin-j and spin-j and semiperiodic representations
