Hot Little String Correlators: A View From Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the propagation of a massless minimally coupled scalar in the near
horizon geometry of non-extremal NS5-branes. Using the holographic principle
for dilatonic backgrounds we compute the two-point function of an operator in
Little String Theory at the Hagedorn temperature. We then comment on relations
with correlation functions in two dimensional string theory.
