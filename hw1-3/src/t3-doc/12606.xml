<title>
General bound-state structure of the massive Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the Euclidean path integral and mass perturbation theory we derive,
from the Dyson-Schwinger equations of the massive Schwinger model, a general
formula that incorporates, for sufficiently small fermion mass, all the
bound-state mass poles of the massive Schwinger model. As an illustration we
perturbatively compute the masses of the three lowest bound states.
