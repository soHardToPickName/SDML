<title>
Virtual D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a formalism developed to include collective coordinates, we calculate
the contributions to S-matrix elements due to off-shell D-branes in a string
coupling expansion. The formalism is further used to establish a
two-dimensional computation of higher order corrections to the D-brane tension,
both for the bosonic and the supersymmetric cases.
