<title>
The WZ Term of the Spinning String and its On-shell Structure
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wess-Zumino term of the spinning string is constructed in terms of their
anomalies using an extended field-antifield formalism. A new feature appears
from a fact that the non-anomalous transformations do not form a sub-group. The
algebra of the extended variables closes only using the equations of motion
derived from the WZ term.
