<title>
Symplectic reduction of p-form electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a simple method to reduce a general p-form electrodynamics with
respect to the standard Gauss constraints. The canonical structure of the
reduced theory displays a p-dependent sign which makes the essential difference
between theories with different parities of p. This feature was observed
recently in the corresponding quantization condition for p-brane dyons. It
suggests that these two structures are closely related.
