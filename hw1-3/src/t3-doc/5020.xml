Finite Energy Electroweak Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We present finite energy analytic monopole and dyon solutions whose size is
fixed by the electroweak scale. The new solutions are obtained by regularizing
the recent Cho-Maison solutions of the Weinberg-Salam model. Our result shows
that genuine electroweak monopole and dyon could exist whose mass scale is much
smaller than the grand unification scale.
