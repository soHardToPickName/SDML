Interaction Energies of Generalised Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  Generalisations of the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole which can exhibit repulsion
only, attraction only, and both attraction and repulsion, between like
monopoles, are studied numerically. The models supporting these solitons are
SO(3) gauged Higgs models featuring Skyrme-like terms.
