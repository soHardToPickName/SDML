Torsionless T-selfdual Affine NA Toda Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A general construction of affine Non Abelian Toda models in terms of gauged
two loop WZNW model is discussed. In particular we find the
 Lie algebraic condition defining a subclass of {\it T-selfdual torsionless NA
Toda models} and their zero curvature representation.
