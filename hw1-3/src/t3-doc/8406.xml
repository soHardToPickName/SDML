Quantum Determinism for Free Vector Bosons in 3 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply 't Hooft's deterministic quantum mechanics approach to free vector
bosons in three dimensions and check Lorentz invariance. This approach does not
work for the conformal group, for free bosons in two dimensions. This presents
a technical difficulty for constructing a ``deterministic string theory''.
