<title>
Hidden geometrical structures in integrable models
</title>

<abstract>
  The bootstrap equations for the ADE series of purely elastic scattering
theories have turned out to be intimately connected with the geometry of root
systems and the Coxeter element. An informal review of some of this material is
given, mentioning also a couple of other contexts -- the Pasquier models, and
the simply-laced affine Toda field theories -- where similar structures are
encountered. The relevance of twisted Coxeter elements is indicated, and a
construction of these elements inspired by the twisted foldings of the affine
Toda models is described.
