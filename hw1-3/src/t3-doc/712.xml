Bulk Couplings to Noncommutative Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a way to identify the gauge invariant operator in noncommutative
gauge theory on a D-brane with nonzero B field which couples to a specific
supergravity mode in the bulk. This uses the description of noncommutative
gauge theories in terms of ordinary $U(\infty)$ gauge theories in lower
dimensions. The proposal is verified in the DBI approximation. Other authors
have shown that the proposal is also consistent with explicit string worldsheet
calculations. We comment on implications to holography.
