<title>
High energy QCD scattering, the shape of gravity on an IR brane, and the
  Froissart bound
</title>

<abstract>
  High-energy scattering in non-conformal gauge theories is investigated using
the AdS/CFT dual string/gravity theory. It is argued that strong-gravity
processes, such as black hole formation, play an important role in the dual
dynamics. Further information about this dynamics is found by performing a
linearized analysis of gravity for a mass near an infrared brane; this gives
the far field approximation to black hole or other strong-gravity effects, and
in particular allows us to estimate their shape. From this shape, one can infer
a total scattering cross-section that grows with center of mass energy as ln^2
E, saturating the Froissart bound.
