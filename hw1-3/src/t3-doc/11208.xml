On a core instability of 't Hooft Polyakov monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a core instability of 't Hooft Polyakov monopoles in Alice
electrodynamics type of models in which charge conjugation symmetry is gauged.
The monopole may deform into a toroidal defect which carries an Alice flux and
a (non-localizable) magnetic Cheshire charge.
