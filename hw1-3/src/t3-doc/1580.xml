Parametric holomorphy? Triviality versus Duality in Sinh-Gordon
</title>

<abstract>
  Suppose a regularised functional integral depends holomorphically on a
parameter that receives only a finite renormalization. Can one expect the
correlation functions to retain the analyticity in the parameter after removal
of the cutoff(s)? We examine the issue in the Sinh-Gordon theory by computing
the intrinsic 4-point coupling as a function of the Lagrangian coupling \beta.
Drawing on the conjectured triviality of the model in its functional integral
formulation for \beta^2 > 8\pi, and the weak-strong coupling duality in the
bootstrap formulation on the other hand, we conclude that the operations:
``Removal of the cutoff(s)'' and ``analytic continuation in \beta'' do not
commute.
