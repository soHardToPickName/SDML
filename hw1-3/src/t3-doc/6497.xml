<title>
Non-commutative Branes from M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The analysis of the worldvolume effective actions of the M-theory
Kaluza-Klein monopole and 9-brane suggests that it should be possible to
describe non-abelian configurations of M2-branes or M5-branes if the M2-branes
are transverse to the eleventh direction and the M5-branes are wrapped on it.
This is determined by the fact that the Kaluza-Klein monopole and the M9-brane
are constrained to move in particular isometric spacetimes. We show that the
same kind of situation is implied by the analysis of the brane descent
relations in M-theory. We compute some of the non-commutative couplings of the
worldvolume effective actions of these non-abelian systems of M2 and M5 branes
and show that they indicate the existence of configurations corresponding to N
branes expanding into a higher dimensional M-brane. The reduction to Type II
brings up new descriptions of coincident D-branes at strong coupling. We show
that these systems have the right non-commutative charges to describe certain
expanded configurations playing a role in the framework of the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Finally, we discuss the realization of non-commutative brane
configurations as topological solitons in non-abelian brane-antibrane systems.
