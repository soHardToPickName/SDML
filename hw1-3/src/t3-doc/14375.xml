Finite volume partition functions and Itzykson-Zuber integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the finite volume QCD partition function for arbitrary quark masses.
This is a generalization of a result obtained by Leutwyler and Smilga for equal
quark masses. Our result is derived in the sector of zero topological charge
using a generalization of the Itzykson-Zuber integral appropriate for arbitrary
complex matrices. We present a conjecture regarding the result for arbitrary
topological charge which reproduces the Leutwyler-Smilga result in the limit of
equal quark masses. We derive a formula of the Itzykson-Zuber type for
arbitrary {\em rectangular\/} complex matrices, extending the result of Guhr
and Wettig obtained for {\em square\/} matrices.
