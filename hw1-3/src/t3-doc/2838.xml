<title>
Superstrings from theories with N>1 world-sheet supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  String theories with (N,N') local world-sheet supersymmetries are related
to each other by marginal deformations. This connects N=1 and N=0 theories
in which the target-spaces are interpreted as space-times, N=2 theories in
which the target spaces can be interpreted as world-volumes, and theories with
$N\ge 3$, in which the central charge vanishes -- theories with zero
target-space dimensions.
