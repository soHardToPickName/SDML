<title>
A Dynamical Approach to Gauge Fixing
</title>

<abstract>
  We study gauge fixing in the generalized Gupta-Bleuler quantization. In this
method physical states are defined to be simultaneous null eigenstates of a set
of quantum invariants. We apply the method to a solvable model proposed by
Friedberg, Lee, Pang and Ren and show that no Gribov-type copies appears by
construction.
