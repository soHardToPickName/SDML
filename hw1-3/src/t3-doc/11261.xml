<title>
Chiral Decomposition For Non-Abelian Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the non-abelian extension for the splitting of a scalar field into
chiral components. Using this procedure we find a non ambiguous way of coupling
a non abelian chiral scalar field to gravity. We start with a (non-chiral) WZW
model covariantly coupled to a background metric and, after the splitting,
arrive at two chiral Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models coupled to gravity.
