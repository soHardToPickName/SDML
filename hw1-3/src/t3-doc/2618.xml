Factorization in processes of graviton scattering off electron for Z and
  W productions
</title>

<abstract>
  The study of factorization in linearized gravity is extended to the graviton
scattering processes with an electron for the massive vector boson productions
such as $g e \rightarrow Z e$ and $g e \rightarrow W \nu_e$. It is shown that
every transition amplitude is completely factorized due to gravitational gauge
invariance and Lorentz invariance. Also the explicit values of vector boson
polarizations are obtained.
