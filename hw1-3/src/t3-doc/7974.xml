Born-Infeld strings between D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the solutions of world-volume action for a D3-brane being put near
other D3-brane which is replaced by the background configuration of bulk space.
It is shown that the BPS solutions are not affected by the D3-brane background,
and they are interpreted as dyonic strings connecting two branes. On the
contrary, the non-BPS configurations are largely influenced by the background
D-brane, and we find that the solutions with pure electric charge cannot
connect two branes. These solutions are corresponding to the bound state of
brane and anti-brane which has been found by Callan and Maldacena
