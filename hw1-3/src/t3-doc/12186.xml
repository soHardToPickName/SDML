Multivariable Invariants of Colored Links Generalizing the Alexander
  Polynomial
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss multivariable invariants of colored links associated with the
$N$-dimensional root of unity representation of the quantum group. The
invariants for $N>2$ are generalizations of the multi-variable Alexander
polynomial. The invariants vanish for disconnected links. We review the
definition of the invariants through (1,1)-tangles. When $(N,3)=1$ and $N$ is
odd, the invariant does not vanish for the parallel link (cable) of the knot
$3_1$, while the Alexander polynomial vanishes for the cable link.
