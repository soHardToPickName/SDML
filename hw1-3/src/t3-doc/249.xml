BRST Quantization of the Proca Model based on the BFT and the BFV
  Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST quantization of the Abelian Proca model is performed using the
Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin and the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism. First, the
BFT Hamiltonian method is applied in order to systematically convert a second
class constraint system of the model into an effectively first class one by
introducing new fields. In finding the involutive Hamiltonian we adopt a new
approach which is more simpler than the usual one. We also show that in our
model the Dirac brackets of the phase space variables in the original second
class constraint system are exactly the same as the Poisson brackets of the
corresponding modified fields in the extended phase space due to the linear
character of the constraints comparing the Dirac or Faddeev-Jackiw formalisms.
Then, according to the BFV formalism we obtain that the desired resulting
Lagrangian preserving BRST symmetry in the standard local gauge fixing
procedure naturally includes the St\"uckelberg scalar related to the explicit
gauge symmetry breaking effect due to the presence of the mass term. We also
analyze the nonstandard nonlocal gauge fixing procedure.
