<title>
A Hierarchy of Super $w$\ Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the N-extended super $w_n$\ string can be obtained as a
special class of vacua of both the N-extended super $w_{n+1}$\ string and the
(N+1)-extended super $w_n$\ string. This hierarchy of super $w$\ string
theories includes as subhierarchies both the superstring hierarchy given by
Bastianelli, Ohta and Petersen and the $w$\ string hierarchy given by the
authors.
