<title>
Towards Covariant Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review an approach towards a covariant formulation of Matrix theory based
on a discretization of the 11d membrane. Higher dimensional algebraic
structures, such as the quantum triple Nambu bracket, naturally appear in this
approach. We also discuss a novel geometric understanding of the space-time
uncertainty relation which points towards a more geometric formulation of
Matrix theory.
