<title>
On Asymptotic Freedom and Confinement from Type-IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new type-IIB supergravity vacuum that describes the strong
coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has a running
coupling such that the theory becomes asymptotically free in the ultraviolet.
It also has a running theta angle due to a non-vanishing axion field in the
supergravity solution. We also present a worm-hole solution, which has finite
action per unit four-dimensional volume and two asymptotic regions, a flat
space and an AdS^5\times S^5. The corresponding N=2 gauge theory, instead of
being finite, has a running coupling. We compute the quark-antiquark potential
in this case and find that it exhibits, under certain assumptions, an area-law
behaviour for large separations.
