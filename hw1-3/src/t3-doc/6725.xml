<title>
The quantum Poincare group from quantum group contraction
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a contraction of the de Sitter quantum group leading to the
quantum Poincare group in any dimensions. The method relies on the coaction of
the de Sitter quantum group on a non--commutative space, and the deformation
parameter $q$ is sent to one. The bicrossproduct structure of the quantum
Poincar\'e group is exhibited and shown to be dual to the one of the
$\kappa$--Poincar\'e Hopf algebra, at least in two dimensions.
