Matrix description of D-branes on 3-spheres
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a matrix model for D0-branes on S^3 \times M^7 based on quantum
group symmetries. For finite radius of S^3 (i.e. for finite k), it gives
results beyond the reach of the ordinary matrix model. For large k all known
static properties of branes on S^3 are reproduced.
