<title>
A simple mechanical analog of the field theory of tachyon matter
</title>

<abstract>
  In this brief note we show that the zero dimensional version of the field
theory of tachyon matter proposed by Sen, provides an action integral
formulation for the motion of a particle in the presence of Newtonian gravity
and nonlinear damping (quadratic in velocity).
