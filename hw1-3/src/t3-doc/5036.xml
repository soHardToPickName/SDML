The zeros of the QCD partition function
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish a relationship between the zeros of the partition function in
the complex mass plane and the spectral properties of the Dirac operator in
QCD. This relation is derived within the context of chiral Random Matrix Theory
and applies to QCD when chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken. Further, we
introduce and examine the concept of normal modes in chiral spectra. Using this
formalism we study the consequences of a finite Thouless energy for the zeros
of the partition function. This leads to the demonstration that certain
features of the QCD partition function are universal.
