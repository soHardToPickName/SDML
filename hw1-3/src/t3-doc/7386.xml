<title>
Self-tuning solutions of the cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  I briefly review the cosmological constant problem and attempts toward its
solution, and present the first nontrivial example for the self-tuning
mechanism with a $1/H^2$ term with the antisymmetric field strength $H_{MNPQ}$
in a 5D RS-II setup.
