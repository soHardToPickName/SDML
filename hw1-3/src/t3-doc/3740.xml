Cosmological perturbation spectra from SL(4,R)-invariant effective
  actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate four-dimensional cosmological vacuum solutions derived from an
effective action invariant under global SL(n,R) transformations. We find the
general solutions for linear axion field perturbations about homogeneous
dilaton-moduli-vacuum solutions for an SL(4,R)-invariant action and find the
spectrum of super-horizon perturbations resulting from vacuum fluctuations in a
pre big bang scenario. We show that for SL(n,R)-invariant actions with n>3
there exists a regime of parameter space of non-zero measure where all the
axion field spectra have positive spectral tilt, as required if light axion
fields are to provide a seed for anisotropies in the microwave background and
large-scale structure in the universe.
