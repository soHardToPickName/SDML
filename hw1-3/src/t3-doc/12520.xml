<title>
Effect of Self-Interaction on Charged Black Hole Radiance
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend our previous analysis of the modification of the spectrum of black
hole radiance due to the simplest and probably most quantitatively important
back-reaction effect, that is self-gravitational interaction, to the case of
charged holes. As anticipated, the corrections are small for low-energy
radiation when the hole is well away from extremality, butbecome qualitatively
important near extremality. A notable result is that radiation which could
leave the hole with mass and charge characteristic of a naked singularity,
predicted in the usual approximation of fixed space-time geometry, is here
suppressed. We discuss the nature of our approximations, and show how they work
in a simpler electromagnetic analogue problem.
