Global Structure of Deffayet (Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati) Cosmologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We detail the global structure of the five-dimensional bulk for the
cosmological evolution of Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati braneworlds. The picture
articulated here provides a framework and intuition for understanding how
metric perturbations leave (and possibly reenter) the brane universe. A bulk
observer sees the braneworld as a relativistically expanding bubble, viewed
either from the interior (in the case of the
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker phase) or the exterior (the
self-accelerating phase). Shortcuts through the bulk in the first phase can
lead to an apparent brane causality violation and provide an opportunity for
the evasion of the horizon problem found in conventional four-dimensional
cosmologies. Features of the global geometry in the latter phase anticipate a
depletion of power for linear metric perturbations on large scales.
