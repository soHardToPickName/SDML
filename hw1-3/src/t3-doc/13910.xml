Brane Potentials and Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the supergravity moduli spaces of D1-D5 and D2-D6 brane
systems coincide with those of the Coulomb branches of the associated
non-abelian gauge theories. We further discuss situations in which worldvolume
brane actions include a potential term generated by probing certain
supergravity backgrounds. We find that in many cases, the appearance of the
potential is due to the application of the Scherk-Schwarz mechanism. We give
some examples and discuss the existence of novel supersymmetric brane
configurations.
