The Higgs Mechanism in Non-commutative Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper investigates the non-commutative version of the Abelian Higgs
model at the one loop level. We find that the BRST invariance of the theory is
maintained at this order in perturbation theory, rendering the theory one-loop
renormalizable. Upon removing the gauge field from the theory we also obtain a
consistent continuum renormalization of the broken O(2) linear sigma model,
contradicting results found in the literature. The beta functions for the
various couplings of the gauged U(1) theory are presented, as are the divergent
contributions to every one particle irreducible (1PI) function. We find that
all physical couplings and masses are gauge independent. A brief discussion
concerning the symmetries $P$, $C$, and $T$ in this theory is also given.
