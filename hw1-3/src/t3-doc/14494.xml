Partition Function on Not-flat Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a partition function on the not-flat D1-brane can be written in
the same form as that on the flat one in $\alpha^\prime$-order. In this case
the information of the curvature of the brane configuration is included in
tachyon beta function.
