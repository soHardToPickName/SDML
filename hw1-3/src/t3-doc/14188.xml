Quantum Spacetimes in the Year 1
</title>

<abstract>
  We review certain emergent notions on the nature of spacetime from
noncommutative geometry and their radical implications. These ideas of
spacetime are suggested from developments in fuzzy physics, string theory, and
deformation quantisation. The review focuses on the ideas coming from fuzzy
physics. We find models of quantum spacetime like fuzzy $S^4$ on which states
cannot be localised, but which fluctuate into other manifolds like $ CP^3$ .
New uncertainty principles concerning such lack of localisability on quantum
spacetimes are formulated.Such investigations show the possibility of
formulating and answering questions like the probabilty of finding a point of a
quantum manifold in a state localised on another one. Additional striking
possibilities indicated by these developments is the (generic) failure of $CPT$
theorem and the conventional spin-statistics connection. They even suggest that
Planck's `` constant '' may not be a constant, but an operator which does not
commute with all observables. All these novel possibilities arise within the
rules of conventional quantum physics,and with no serious input from gravity
physics.
