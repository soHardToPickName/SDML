Supergravity Supertubes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the supergravity solution sourced by a supertube: a
(1/4)-supersymmetric D0-charged IIA superstring that has been blown up to a
cylindrical D2-brane by angular momentum. The supergravity solution captures
all essential features of the supertube, including the D2-dipole moment and an
upper bound on the angular momentum: violation of this bound implies the
existence of closed timelike curves, with a consequent ghost-induced
instability of supertube probes.
