Protected Multiplets of M-Theory on a Plane Wave
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the symmetry algebra governing the interacting part of the
matrix model for M-theory on the maximally supersymmetric pp-wave is the basic
classical Lie superalgebra SU(4|2). We determine the SU(4|2) multiplets present
in the exact spectrum in the limit where \mu (the mass parameter) becomes
infinite, and find that these include infinitely many BPS multiplets. Using the
representation theory of SU(4|2), we demonstrate that some of these BPS
multiplets, including all of the vacuum states of the matrix model plus certain
infinite towers of excited states, have energies which are exactly protected
non-perturbatively for any value of \mu > 0. In the large N limit, these lead
to exact quantum states of M-theory on the pp-wave. We also show explicitly
that there are certain BPS multiplets which do receive energy corrections by
combining with other BPS multiplets to form ordinary multiplets.
