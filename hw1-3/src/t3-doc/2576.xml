Dirac Spectrum in Adjoint QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture we discuss some exact results for the low-lying spectrum of
the Dirac operator in adjoint QCD. In particular, we find an analytical
expression for the slope of the average spectral density. These results are
obtained by means of a generating function which is an extension of the QCD
partition function with fermionic and bosonic ghost quarks. The low-energy
limit of this generating function is completely determined by chiral
(super-)symmetries. Our results for the slope of the average spectral density
are consistent with the results for the scalar susceptibility which can be
obtained from the usual chiral Lagrangian.
