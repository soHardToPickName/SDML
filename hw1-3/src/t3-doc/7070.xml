Color Confinement in Perturbation Theory from a Topological Model,
</title>

<abstract>
Color confinement by the mechanism of Kugo and Ojima can treat confinement of
any quantized color carrying fields including dynamical quarks. However, the
non-perturbative condition for this confinement has been known to be satisfied
only in the pure-gauge model (PGM), which is a topological model without
physical degrees of freedom. Here we analyze the Yang-Mills theory by adding
physical degrees of freedom as perturbation to PGM. We find that quarks and
gluons are indeed confined in this perturbation theory.
