Braneworld physics from the analog-gravity perspective
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Randall-Sundrum brane models from the viewpoint of condensed
matter/quantum optics. Following the idea of analog gravity we obtain effective
metrics in fluid and Bose-Einstein-condensate systems mimicking those in the
brane framework. We see that the effect of warp factors in the bulk geometry
translates into finite-size of the analog systems. We stress that many open
questions in braneworld physics can benefit from the understanding of critical
phenomena of surfaces in finite analog systems.
