B\"acklund transformations for nonlinear evolution equations: Hilbert
  space approach
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method of determining B\"acklund transformations for nonlinear partial
differential equations of the evolution type is introduced. Using the Hilbert
space approach the problem of finding B\"acklund transformations is brought
down to the solution of an abstract equation in Hilbert space.
