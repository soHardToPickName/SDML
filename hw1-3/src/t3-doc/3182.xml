Effective QCD Partition Function in Sectors with Non-Zero Topological
  Charge and Itzykson-Zuber Type Integral
</title>

<abstract>
  It was conjectured by Jackson et.al. that the finite volume effective
partition function of QCD with the topological charge $M-N$ coincides with the
Itzyskon-Zuber type integral for $M\times N$ rectangular matrices. In the
present article we give a proof of this conjecture, in which the original
Itzykson-Zuber integral is utilized.
