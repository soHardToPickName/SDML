<title>
Oscillating Inflation with a non-minimally coupled scalar field
</title>

<abstract>
  The oscillating inflation model recently proposed by Damour and Mukhanov is
investigated with a non-minimal coupling. Numerical study confirms an
inflationary behavior and the density perturbation is obtained. A successful
inflation requires the gravity-dilaton coupling to be small.
