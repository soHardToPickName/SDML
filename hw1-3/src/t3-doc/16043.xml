Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and Gravitational Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  Various string theory realizations of three-dimensional gauge theories relate
them to gravitational instantons, Nahm equations and monopoles. We use this
correspondence to model self-dual gravitational instantons of $D_k$-type as
moduli spaces of singular monopoles, find their twistor spaces and metrics.
