The spectrum of multi-flavor QCD_2 and the non-Abelian Schwinger
  equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Massless $QCD_2$ is dominated by classical configurations in the large $N_f$
limit. We use this observation to study the theory by finding solutions to
equations of motion, which are the non-Abelian generalization of the Schwinger
equation. We find that the spectrum consists of massive mesons with $M^2={e^2
N_f\over 2\pi}$ which correspond to Abelian solutions. We generalize previously
discovered non-Abelian solutions and discuss their interpretation. We prove a
no-go theorem ruling out the existence of soliton solutions. Thus the
semi-classical approximation shows no baryons in the case of massless quarks, a
result derived before in the strong-coupling limit only.
