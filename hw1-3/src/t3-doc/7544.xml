Surprises with angular momentum
</title>

<abstract>
  The physics of angular momentum in even space dimensions can be surprisingly
counter-intuitive. Three such suprises, all associated with the properties of
supersymmetric rotating objects, are examined: (i) 5D black holes, (ii) Dyonic
instantons and (iii) Supertubes.
