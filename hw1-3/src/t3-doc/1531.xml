Spin-Statistics and CPT for solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  The statistics of soliton sectors of massive 2D field theories is analysed.
In the soliton field algebra, the non-local commutation relations are
determined and Weak Locality, Spin-Statistics and CPT theorems are proven.
These theorems depart from their usual appearance due to the broken symmetry
connecting the inequivalent vacua. An interpretation in terms of modular theory
is given. For the neutral subalgebra, the theorems hold in the familiar form,
and Twisted Locality is derived.
