<title>
Gravity localization with a domain wall junction in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study gravity localization in the context of a six-dimensional gravity
model coupled with complex scalar fields. With a supergravity-motivated scalar
potential, we show that the domain wall junction solutions localize a
four-dimensional massless graviton under an assumption on the wall profile. We
find that unlike the global supersymmetric model, contributions to the junction
tension cancel locally with gravitational contributions. The wall tension
vanishes due to the metric suppression.
