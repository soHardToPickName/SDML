Non-BPS Branes of Supersymmetric Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider five-dimensional brane worlds with N=2 gauged supergravity in the
bulk coupled supersymmetrically to two boundary branes at the fixed points of a
Z_2 symmetry. We analyse two mechanisms that break supersymmetry either by
choosing flipped fermionic boundary conditions on the boundary branes or by
modifying the gravitino variation to include both Z_2-odd and Z_2-even
operators. In all cases we find the corresponding background. Including an even
part in the gravitino variation leads to tilted branes. Choosing the flipped
boundary conditions leads to AdS_4 branes and stabilized radion in the detuned
case, when the expectation value of the even variation is nonzero. Another
solution has the interpretation of moving AdS_4 branes separated by a horizon.
The solution with moving branes separated by a horizon can be extended to the
tuned case. In the presence of a horizon, temperature mediation communicates
supersymmetry breakdown to the branes.
