<title>
Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of a weakly-interacting
  photon gas in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity
</title>

<abstract>
  A field theoretical framework for the recently proposed photon condensation
effect in a nonlinear Fabry-Perot cavity is discussed. The dynamics of the
photon gas turns out to be described by an effective 2D Hamiltonian of a
complex massive scalar field. Finite size effects are shown to be relevant for
the existence of the photon condensate.
