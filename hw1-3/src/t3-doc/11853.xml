<title>
An Introduction to Non-perturbative String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this review I discuss some basic aspects of non-perturbative string
theory. The topics include test of duality symmetries based on the analysis of
the low energy effective action and the spectrum of BPS states, relationship
between different duality symmetries, an introduction to M- and F-theories,
black hole entropy in string theory, and Matrix theory.
