<title>
Modification of black-hole entropy by strings
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalized action for strings which is a sum of the Nambu-Goto and the
extrinsic curvature (the energy integral of the surface) terms, is used to
couple strings to gravity. It is shown that the conical singularity has deficit
angle that has contributions from both the above terms. It is found that the
effect of extrinsic curvature is to oppose that of the N-G action for the
temperature of the black-hole and to modify the entropy-area relation.
