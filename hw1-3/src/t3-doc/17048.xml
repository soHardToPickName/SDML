Spectrum of Type IIB Supergravity on AdS_5 x T^{11}: Predictions on N =
  1 SCFT's
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the full Kaluza-Klein spectrum of type IIB supergravity
compactified on AdS_5 x T^{11} with T^{11} = (SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). From the
knowledge of the spectrum and general multiplet shortening conditions, we make
a refined test of the AdS/CFT correspondence, by comparison between various
shortenings of SU(2,2|1) supermultiplets on AdS_5 and different families of
boundary operators with protected dimensions. Additional towers of long
multiplets with rational dimensions, that are not protected by supersymmetry,
are also predicted from the supergravity analysis.
