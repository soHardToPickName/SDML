<title>
Nonlinear vector susy for the three-dimensional topological massive
  Yang-Mills theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A nonlinear vector supersymmetry for three-dimensional topological massive
Yang-Mills is obtained by making use of a nonlinear but local and covariant
redefinition of the gauge field.
