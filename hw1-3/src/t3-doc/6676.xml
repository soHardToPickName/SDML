<title>
BRST ANALYSIS OF GAUGE THEORIES BASED ON NONLINEAR ALGEBRAS IN $2d$
</title>

<abstract>
  Covariant quantization of theories based on nonlinear extensions of Lie
algebras in $2d$ is studied by using a generalized Lagrangian BRST formalism.
The quantum action is constructed to be invariant under the off--shell
nilpotent BRST transformations by using a set of independent antifields as
auxiliary, nonpropagating variables in the quantum theory. The general results
are applied to the quantization of nonlinear gauge theory based on quadratic
Poincar\'e algebra, which is closely related to $2d$ gravity with dynamical
torsion.
