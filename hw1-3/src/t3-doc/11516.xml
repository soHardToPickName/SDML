<title>
Separation of variables for the quantum relativistic Toda lattices
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quantum analogs of the relativistic Toda lattices and give new
$2\times 2$ $L$-operators for these models. Making use of the variable
separation the spectral problem for the quantum integrals of motion is reduced
to solving one-dimensional separation equations.
