<title>
Classical description of spinning degrees of freedom of relativistic
  particles by means of commuting spinors
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a possibility to describe spin one-half and higher spins of
massive relativistic particles by means of commuting spinors. We present two
classical gauge models with the variables $x^\mu,\xi_\alpha,\chi_\alpha$, where
$\xi,\chi$ are commuting Majorana spinors. In course of quantization both
models reproduce Dirac equation. We analyze the possibility to introduce an
interaction with an external electromagnetic background into the models and to
generalize them to higher spin description. The first model admits a minimal
interaction with the external electromagnetic field, but leads to reducible
representations of the Poincare group being generalized for higher spins. The
second model turns out to be appropriate for description of the massive higher
spins. However, it seams to be difficult to introduce a minimal interaction
with an external electromagnetic field into this model. We compare our approach
with one, which uses Grassman variables, and establish a relation between them.
