<title>
Free Field Representation of $osp(2|1)$ and $U_q(osp(2|1))$ and N=1
  (q-)Superstring Correlation Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  The free field realization of irreducible representations of $\os$ is
constructed, by a unified and systematic scheme. The $q$-analog of this unified
scheme is used to construct $q$-free field realization of irreducible
representations of $\uos$. By using these realization, the two point function
of $N=1$ superconformal (q-superconformal) model based on $\os$ ($\uos$)
symmetry have been calculated.
