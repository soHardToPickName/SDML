Relations between correlators in gauge field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact relations between gauge-invariant vacuum correlators in QCD are
derived. Derivatives of the correlators are expressed in terms of higher orders
correlators. The behaviour of the correlators at large and small distances due
to these relations is discussed.
