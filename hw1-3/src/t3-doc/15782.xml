Is N=4 Yang-Mills Theory Soluble?
</title>

<abstract>
  The superconformal properties of N=4 Yang-Mills theory are most naturally
studied using the formalism of harmonic superspace. Superconformal invariance
is shown to imply that the Green's functions of analytic operators are
invariant holomorphic sections of a line bundle on a product of certain
harmonic superspaces and it is argued that the theory is soluble for a class of
such operators.
