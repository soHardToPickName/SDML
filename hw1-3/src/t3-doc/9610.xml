<title>
Construction of exactly solvable quantum models of Calogero and
  Sutherland type with translation invariant four-particle interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct exactly solvable models for four particles moving on a real line
or on a circle with translation invariant two- and four-particle interactions.
