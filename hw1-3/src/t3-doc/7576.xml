Branes and BPS Configurations of Non-Commutative/Commutative Gauge
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS Dirac monopole in U(1) gauge theory on non-commutative
spacetime. The corresponding brane configuration is obtained in the equivalent
ordinary gauge theory through the map proposed by Seiberg and Witten. This
configuration coincides exactly with a tilted D-string as predicted. This study
provides an interesting check of the equivalence of the non-commutative and
ordinary gauge theories.
