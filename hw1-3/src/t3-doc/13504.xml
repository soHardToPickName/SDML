<title>
Anomalies and Deconfinement
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss how instanton effects can be wiped-out due to the existence of
anomalies. I first consider Compact Quantum Electrodynamics in 3 dimensions
where confinement of electric charge is destroyed when fermions are added so
that a Chern-Simons term is generated as a one-loop effect. I also show that a
similar phenomenon occurs in the two-dimensional abelian chiral Higgs model. In
both cases anomalies (parity anomaly, gauge anomaly) are responsible of the
deconfinement mechanism.
