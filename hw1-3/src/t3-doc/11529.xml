Generalization of a result of Matsuo and Cherednik to the
  Calogero-Sutherland- Moser integrable models with exchange terms
</title>

<abstract>
  A few years ago, Matsuo and Cherednik proved that from some solutions of the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations, which first appeared in conformal field
theory, one can obtain wave functions for the Calogero integrable system. In
the present communication, it is shown that from some solutions of generalized
KZ equations, one can construct wave functions, characterized by any given
permutational symmetry, for some Calogero-Sutherland-Moser integrable models
with exchange terms. Such models include the spin generalizations of the
original Calogero and Sutherland ones, as well as that with $\delta$-function
interaction.
