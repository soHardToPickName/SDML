<title>
A note on heterotic/type I' duality and D0 brane quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note a simple calculation of one loop threshold corrections for the
SO(32) heterotic string is performed. In particular the compactification on T^2
with a Wilson line breaking the gauge group to SO(16) x SO(16) is considered.
Using heterotic type I duality, these corrections can be related to quantities
appearing in the quantum mechanics of type I' D0 particles.
