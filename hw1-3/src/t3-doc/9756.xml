<title>
Exponential behavior of a quantum system in a macroscopic medium
</title>

<abstract>
  An exponential behavior at all times is derived for a solvable dynamical
model in the weak-coupling, macroscopic limit. Some implications for the
quantum measurement problem are discussed, in particular in connection with
dissipation.
