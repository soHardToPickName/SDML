Comments on D-branes in flux backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct supergravity solutions for D-branes in nontrivial flux
backgrounds. We revisit the issue of charge quantization in this framework, and
show that in these backgrounds, charge need not be quantized. We also show in a
particular example that the semiclassical description of branes produces
integral charges.
