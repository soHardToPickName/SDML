<title>
Conformal Foliations and Constraint Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Classical Constraint Algebra of a Parametrized Relativistic
Gauge System induces a natural structure of Conformal Foliation on a
Transversal Gauge. Using the theory of Conformal Foliations, we provide a
natural Factor Ordering for the Quantum Operators associated to the Canonical
Quantization of such Gauge System.
