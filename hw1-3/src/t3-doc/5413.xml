Two-dimensional Conformal Field Theories on AdS_{2d+1} Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  Various exact two-dimensional conformal field theories with AdS_{2d+1} target
space are constructed. These models can be solved using bosonization
techniques. Some examples are presented that can be used in building
perturbative superstring theories with AdS backgrounds, including AdS_5.
