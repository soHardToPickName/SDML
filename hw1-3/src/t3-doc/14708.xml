Asymptotic level density in heterotic string theory and rotating black
  holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the density of states with given mass and spin in string theory
and obtain asymptotic formulas. We also compute the tree-level gyromagnetic
couplings for arbitrary physical states in the heterotic string theory. These
results are then applied to study whether fundamental strings can consistently
describe the microphysics of the black hole horizon in the case of a general
classical solution characterized by mass, charge and angular momentum.
