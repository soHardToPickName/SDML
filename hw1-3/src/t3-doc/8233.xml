Aspects of Six Dimensional Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this contribution some aspects of supergravity and super Yang-Mills
systems in D=6 are briefly reviewed and, in some cases, are contrasted with the
analogous features in D=4. Particular emphasis is laid on the stringy solutions
of the D=6 super Yang-Mills systems.
