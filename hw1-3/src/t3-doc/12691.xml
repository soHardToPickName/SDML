Distances on a one-dimensional lattice from noncommutative geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In the following paper we continue the work of Bimonte-Lizzi-Sparano on
distances on a one dimensional lattice. We succeed in proving analytically the
exact formulae for such distances. We find that the distance to an even point
on the lattice is the geometrical average of the ``predecessor'' and
``successor'' distances to the neighbouring odd points.
