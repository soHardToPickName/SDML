The Multisite Antiferromagnetic Ising Spin Model and Universality of
  Feigenbaum Constants
</title>

<abstract>
  The Feigenbaum constants $\alpha$ and $\delta$ for the three-site
antiferromagnetic Ising spin model on Husimi tree are calculated. It is shown
that the numerical values of these constants for this real physical system
coincide with the famous universal Feigenbaum constants with high accuracy. The
quantitative description from ordering to chaos is also obtained.
