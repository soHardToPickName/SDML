A Finite-Temperature Periodic Structure in (SUPER)STRING Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a Laurent series representation for the (super)string one-loop free
energy, an explicit form for the analytic continuation of the Laurent series
beyond the critical (Hagedorn) temperature is obtained. As an additional
result, a periodic structure is found in (super)string thermodynamics. A brief
physical discussion about the origin and meaning of such structure is carried
out.
