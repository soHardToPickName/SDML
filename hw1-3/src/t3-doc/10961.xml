<title>
Non-orientable Boundary Superstring Field theory with Tachyon field
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the BSFT method to study the unoriented open string field theory (type
I). The partition function on the Mobius strip is calculated. We find that, at
the one-loop level, the divergence coming from planar graph and unoriented
graph cancel each other as expected.
