Type IIB instanton as a wave in twelve dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  0-brane of type IIA string theory can be interpreted as a dimensional
reduction of a gravitational wave in 11 dimensions. We observe that a similar
interpretation applies also to the D-instanton background of type IIB theory:
it can be viewed as a reduction (along one spatial and one time-like direction)
of a wave in a 12-dimensional theory. The instanton charge is thus related to a
linear momentum in 12 dimensions. This suggests that the instanton should play
as important role in type IIB theory as the 0-brane is supposed to play in type
IIA theory.
