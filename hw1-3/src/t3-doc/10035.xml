Reply to comment by Zaslavskii on extremal black hole action
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that Zaslavskii's misunderstanding of our published proof of the
irrelevance of all extremal black hole configurations (whether with equal
charge and mass or not) rests on his refusal to see the essential difference
between the correct inequality governing extremal and non-extremal actions and
his incorrect version.
