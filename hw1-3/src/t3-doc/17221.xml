<title>
AdS/CFT correspondence, conformal anomaly and quantum corrected entropy
  bounds
</title>

<abstract>
  The role of conformal anomaly in AdS/CFT and related issues is clarified. The
comparison of holographic and QFT conformal anomalies (with account of brane
quantum gravity contribution) indicates on the possibility for brane quantum
gravity to occur within AdS/CFT set-up. 3d quantum induced inflationary (or
hyperbolic) brane-world is shown to be realized in frames of AdS3/CFT2
correspondence where the role of 2d brane cosmological constant is played by
effective tension due to two-dimensional conformal anomaly. The dynamical
equations to describe 4d FRW-Universe with account of quantum effects produced
by conformal anomaly are obtained. The quantum corrected energy, pressure and
entropy are found. Dynamical evolution of entropy bounds in inflationary
Universe is estimated and its comparison with quantum corrected entropy is
done. It is demonstrated that entropy bounds for quantum corrected entropy are
getting the approximate ones and occur for some limited periods of evolution of
inflationary Universe.
