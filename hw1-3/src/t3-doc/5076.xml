Static Colored SU(2) Sources in (1+1)-Dimensions - An Analytic Solution
  in the Electric Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the Schroedinger Electric Representation we analytically calculate the
complete wave functional obeying Gauss' law with static SU(2) sources in
(1+1)-dimensions. The effective potential is found to be linear in the distance
between the sources as expected.
