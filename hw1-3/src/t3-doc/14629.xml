Born-Infeld electrodynamics: Clifford number and spinor representations
</title>

<abstract>
  Clifford number formalism for Maxwell equations is considered. The Clifford
imaginary unit for space-time is introduced as coordinate independent form of
fully antisymmetric fourth-rank tensor. The representation of Maxwell equations
in massless Dirac equation form is considered; we also consider two approaches
to the invariance of Dirac equation in respect of the Lorentz transformations.
According to the first approach, the unknown column is invariant and according
to the second approach it has the transformation properties known as spinorial
ones. Clifford number representation for nonlinear electrodynamics equations is
obtained. From this representation, we obtain the nonlinear like Dirac equation
which is the form of nonlinear electrodynamics equations. As a special case we
have the appropriate representations for
 Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics.
