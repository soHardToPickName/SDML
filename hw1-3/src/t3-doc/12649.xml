<title>
No generalized statistics from dynamics in curved spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider quon statistics in a dynamically evolving curved spacetime in
which prior to some initial time and subsequent to some later time is flat. By
considering the Bogoliubov transformations associated with gravitationally
induced particle creation, we find that the consistent evolution of the
generalized commutation relations from the first flat region to the second flat
region can only occur if $q = \pm 1$.
