<title>
Connes' interpretation of the Standard Model and massive neutrinos
</title>

<abstract>
  Massive neutrinos can be accommodated into the noncommutative geometry
reinterpretation of the Standard Model. The constrained Standard Model
Lagrangian is computed anew under the assumption of nonzero neutrino masses.
This gives the ``prediction" of a mass for the Higgs particle somewhat higher
than in the vanishing neutrino mass case.
