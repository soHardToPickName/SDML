Dynamical $r$-matrices for the Elliptic Calogero-Moser Model
</title>

<abstract>
  For the integrable $N$-particle Calogero-Moser system with elliptic potential
it is shown that the Lax operator found by Krichever possesses a classical
$r$-matrix structure. The $r$-matrix is a natural generalisation of the matrix
found recently by Avan and Talon (hep-th/9210128) for the trigonometric
potential. The $r$-matrix depends on the spectral parameter and only half of
the dynamical variables (particles' coordinates). It satisfies a generalized
Yang-Baxter equation involving another dynamical matrix.
