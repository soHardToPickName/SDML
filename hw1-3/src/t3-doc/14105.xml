<title>
Absence of Radiation Reaction for an Extended Particle in Classical
  Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  There are known problems with the standard Lorentz-Dirac description of
radiation reaction in classical electrodynamics. The model of extended in one
dimension particle is proposed and is shown that for this model there is no
total change in particle momentum due to radiation reaction
