<title>
The Action Principle in Epstein Glaser Renormalization and
  Renormalization of the S-Matrix in $\phi^4$-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A formula describing finite renormalizations is derived in the Epstein-Glaser
formalism and an explicit calculation of finite counterterms in $\Phi
^4$-theory is performed. The Zimmermann identities and the action principle for
changes of parameters in the interaction are presented independent of the
adiabatic limit.
