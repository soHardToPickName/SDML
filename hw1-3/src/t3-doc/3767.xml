<title>
The Crumpling Transition of Dynamically Triangulated Random Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the crumpling transition in three-dimensional Euclidian space of
dynamically triangulated random surfaces with edge extrinsic curvature and
fixed topology of a sphere as well as simulations of a dynamically triangulated
torus. We used longer runs than previous simulations and give new and more
accurate estimates of critical exponents. Our data indicate a cusp singularity
in the specific heat. The transition temperature, as well as the exponents are
topology dependent.
