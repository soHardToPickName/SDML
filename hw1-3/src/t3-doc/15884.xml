<title>
Topological Massive Gauge Theories in Three Dimensions Based on the
  Faddeev-Jackiw Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the (2+1)-dimensional self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons theories
by using the Faddeev-Jackiw formulation and compare the results with those of
the Dirac formalism.
