<title>
A model for time-dependent cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a model for a spacetime dependent cosmological {\it constant}. We
make a realization of this model based on a possible quantum aspects of the
initial stage of the universe and relate the cosmological constant with the
chiral anomaly.
