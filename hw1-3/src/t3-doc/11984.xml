Some uses of $\zeta-$regularization in quantum gravity and cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short guide to some uses of the zeta-function regularization
procedure as a a basic mathematical tool for quantum field theory in curved
space-time (as is the case of Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models), in quantum gravity
models (in different dimensions), and also in cosmology, where it appears e.g.
in the calculation of possible `contributions' to the cosmological constant
coming through manifestations of the vacuum energy density. Part of this
research was carried out in fruitful and enjoyable collaboration with people
from Tomsk State Pedagogical University.
