The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Asymptotically Flat Charged Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the modified Cardy-Verlinde formula without the Casimir effect
term is satisfied by asymptotically flat charged black holes in arbitrary
dimensions. Thermodynamic quantities of the charged black holes are shown to
satisfy the energy-temperature relation of a two-dimensional CFT, which
supports the claim in our previous work (Phys. Rev. D61, 044013,
hep-th/9910244) that thermodynamics of charged black holes in higher dimensions
can be effectively described by two-dimensional theories. We also check the
Cardy formula for the two-dimensional black hole compactified from a dilatonic
charged black hole in higher dimensions.
