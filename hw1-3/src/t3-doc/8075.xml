Regular solutions in Abelian gauge model
</title>

<abstract>
  The regular solutions for the Ginzburg-Landau (-Nielsen-Olesen) Abelian gauge
model are studied numerically. We consider the static isolated cylindrically
symmetric configurations. The well known (Abrikosov) vortices, which present a
particular example of such solutions, play an important role in the theory of
type II superconductors and in the models of structure formation in the early
universe. We find new regular static isolated cylindrically symmetric solutions
which we call the type B and the flux tube solutions. In contrast to the pure
vortex configurations which have finite energy, the new regular solutions
possess a finite Gibbs free energy. The flux tubes appear to be energetically
the most preferable configurations in the interval of external magnetic fields
between the thermodynamic critical value $H_{c}$ and the upper critical field
$H_{c_2}$, while the pure vortex dominate only between the lower critical field
$H_{c_1}$ and $H_{c}$. Our conclusion is thus that type B and flux tube
solutions are important new elements necessary for the correct understanding of
a transition from the vortex state to the completely normal state.
