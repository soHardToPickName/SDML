Notes on Supersymmetric Gauge Theories in Five and Six Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate consistency conditions for supersymmetric gauge theories in
higher dimensions. First, we give a survey of Seiberg's necessary conditions
for the existence of such theories with simple groups in five and six
dimensions. We then make some comments on how theories in different dimensions
are related. In particular, we discuss how the Landau pole can be avoided in
theories that are not asymptotically free in four dimensions, and the mixing of
tensor and vector multiplets in dimensional reduction from six dimensions.
