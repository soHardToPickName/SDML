Can gravity make the Higgs particle light?
</title>

<abstract>
  The spontaneous symmetry breaking theory of gravity is examined, assuming
that the vacuum expectation value of the standard model Higgs is also
responsible for the generation of the Planck mass. In this model the physical
Higgs couples only with gravitational strength to matter. At presently
accessible energies the theory is indistinguishable from the standard model
without Higgs boson and is in agreement with all existing data.At energies
above the Fermi scale new dynamics should occur.
