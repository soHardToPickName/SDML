<title>
Knots and Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a matrix model with d matrices NxN and show that in the limit of
large N and d=0 the model describes the knot diagrams. The same limit in matrix
string theory is also discussed. We speculate that a prototypical M(atrix)
without matrix theory exists in void.
