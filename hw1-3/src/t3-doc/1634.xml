Open strings, 2D gravity and AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a detailed discussion of the duality between dilaton gravity on
AdS_2 and open strings. The correspondence between the two theories is
established using their symmetries and field theoretical, thermodynamic, and
statistical arguments. We use the dual conformal field theory to describe
two-dimensional black holes. In particular, all the semiclassical features of
the black holes, including the entropy, have a natural interpretation in terms
of the dual microscopic conformal dynamics. The previous results are discussed
in the general framework of the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory
dualities.
