Aspects of (2+1) dimensional gravity: AdS3 asymptotic dynamics in the
  framework of Fefferman-Graham-Lee theorems
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Chern-Simon formulation of (2+1) gravity, we derive, for the
general asymptotic metrics given by the Fefferman-Graham-Lee theorems, the
emergence of the Liouville mode associated to the boundary degrees of freedom
of (2+1) dimensional anti de Sitter geometries.
