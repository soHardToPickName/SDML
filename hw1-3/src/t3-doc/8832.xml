<title>
Discontinuities on strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Instead of the infinitesimal extrinsic and intrinsic perturbations on
strings, considered so far, we discuss the evolution and propagation of
finite-amplitude perturbations. Those intrinsic perturbations may result in
appearance of stable discontinuities similar to the shock waves.
