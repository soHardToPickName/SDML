<title>
Finiteness of PST self-dual models
</title>

<abstract>
  The Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin model for describing chiral forms is considered at
the quantum level. We study the ultraviolet and infrared behaviour of the model
in two, four and six dimensions in the framework of algebraic renormalization.
The absence of anomalies, as well as the finiteness, up to non-physical
renormalizations, are shown in all dimensions analyzed.
