Photon Splitting in a Very Strong Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  Photon splitting in a very strong magnetic field is analyzed for energy
$\omega < 2m$. The amplitude obtained on the base of operator-diagram technique
is used. It is shown that in a magnetic field much higher than critical one the
splitting amplitude is independent on the field. Our calculation is in a good
agreement with previous results of Adler and in a strong contradiction with
recent paper of Mentzel et al.
