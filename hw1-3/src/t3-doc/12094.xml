Non-Trivial Ultraviolet Fixed Point in Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-trivial ultraviolet fixed point in quantum gravity is calculated by
means of the exact renormalization group equation in d-dimensions $(2\simeq
d\leq4)$. It is shown that the ultraviolet non-Gaussian fixed point which is
expected from the perturbatively $\epsilon$-expanded calculations in
$2+\epsilon$ gravity theory remains in d=4. Hence it is possible that quantum
gravity is an asymptotically safe theory and renormalizable in 2<d.
