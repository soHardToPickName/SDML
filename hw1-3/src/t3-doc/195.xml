$B \wedge F$ Term by Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in a generalized
  Abelian Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the topological $B \wedge F$ term in $3+1$ dimensions can be
generated via spontaneous symmetry breaking in a generalized Abelian Higgs
model. Further, we also show that even in $D$ dimensions $ ( D \geq 3 ) $, a $B
\wedge F$ term gives rise to the topological massive excitations of the Abelian
gauge field and that such a $B \wedge F$ term can also be generated via Higgs
mechanism.
