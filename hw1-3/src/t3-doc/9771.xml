<title>
A Perturbative Approach to the Chiral Potts Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The massive high-temperature phase of the chiral Potts quantum chain is
studied using perturbative methods. For the Z_3-chain we present
high-temperature expansions for the groundstate energy and the dispersion
relations of the two single-particle states as well as two-particle states at
general values of the parameters. We also present a perturbative argument
showing that a large class of massive Z_n-spin quantum chains have
quasiparticle spectra with n-1 fundamental particles. It is known from earlier
investigations that -at special values of the parameters- some of the
fundamental particles exist only for limited ranges of the momentum. In these
regimes our argument is not rigorous as one can conclude from a discussion of
the radius of convergence of the perturbation series. We also derive
correlation functions from a perturbative evaluation of the groundstate for the
Z_3-chain. In addition to an exponential decay we observe an oscillating
contribution. The oscillation length seems to be related to the asymmetry of
the dispersion relations. We show that this relation is exact at special values
of the parameters for general Z_n using a form factor expansion.
