<title>
Quantum Gravity and Equivariant Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  A procedure for obtaining correlation function densities and wavefunctionals
for quantum gravity from the Donaldson polynomial invariants of topological
quantum field theories, is given. We illustrate how our procedure may be
applied to three and four dimensional quantum gravity. Detailed expressions,
derived from \sbft{}, are given in the three dimensional case. A procedure for
normalizing these wavefunctionals is proposed.
