<title>
Behavior of logarithmic branch cuts in the self-energy of gluons at
  finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a simple argument for the cancellation of the log(-k^2) terms (k is
the gluon momentum) between the zero-temperature and the temperature-dependent
parts of the thermal self-energy.
