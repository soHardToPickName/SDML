<title>
An action of N=8 self-dual supergravity in ultra-hyperbolic harmonic
  superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The N-extended self-dual supergravity in the ultra-hyperbolic
four-dimensional spacetime of kleinian signature (2+2) is given in the
N-extended harmonic superspace. We reformulate the on-shell N-extended
self-dual supergravity constraints of Siegel to a `zero-curvature'
representation, and solve all of them but one in terms of a single superfield
prepotential, by using a covariant Frobenius gauge in the Devchand-Ogievetsky
approach. An off-shell superspace action, whose equation of motion yields the
remaining constraint, is found. Our manifestly Lorentz-covariant action in
harmonic superspace is very similar to the non-covariant Chern-Simons-type
action, which was proposed earlier by Siegel in the light-cone N=8 superspace.
Our action is also invariant under the residual superdiffeomorphisms and the
residual local OSp(8|2) super-Lorentz rotations, which are left after imposing
the Frobenius gauge. The infinitesimal superfield parameters of the residual
symmetries are expressed in terms of independent analytic superfields.
