Vacuum Polarization Effects from Fermion Zero-Point Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  The influence of an external electromagnetic field on the vacuum structure of
a quantized Dirac field is investigated by considering the quantum corrections
to classical Maxwell's lagrangian density induced by fluctuations of the
non-perturbative vacuum. Effective Lagrangian densities for Maxwell's theory in
(3+1) and (2+1) dimensions are derived from the vacuum zero-point energy of the
fermion field in the context of a consistent Pauli-Villars-Rayski subtraction
scheme, recovering Euler-Kockel-Heisenberg and Maxwell-Chern-Simons effective
theories. Effective scalar quantum electrodymanics is also discussed.
