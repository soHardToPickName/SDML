<title>
The CNM-Hypermultiplet Nexus
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider additional properties of CNM (chiral-nonminimal) models. We show
how 4D, N = 2 nonlinear sigma-models can be described solely in terms of N = 1
superfield CNM doublets. These actions are described by a Kahler potential
together with an infinite number (in the general case) of terms involving its
successively higher derivatives. We briefly discuss how N = 2 supersymmetric
extension of the previously proposed N = 1 CNM low-energy QCD effective action
can be achieved
