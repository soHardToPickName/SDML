Conformal dynamics of quantum gravity with torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  The trace anomaly induced dynamics of the conformal factor is investigated in
four-dimensional quantum gravity with torsion. The constraints for the coupling
constants of torsion matter interaction are obtained in the infrared stable
fixed point of the effective scalar theory.
