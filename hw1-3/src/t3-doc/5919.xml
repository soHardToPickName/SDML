A Direct Method for Obtaining the Differential Conservation Laws
</title>

<abstract>
  A direct method for obtaining the differential conservation laws in the field
theory from the principle of stationary action is proposed. The method is based
on a variation of field functions through small local transformation of a
special kind. The action of general theory of relativity are considered.
