<title>
Holography and T-duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the AdS/SYM correspondence to study the relevant effects of
compactified dimensions on the D-brane dynamics. We present a detailed picture
of the T-duality transition between branes in type IIA and type IIB
supergravity. An analysis of the renormalization scheme coming from the
expectation values of background fields and the role of Wilson lines in it is
given. We finally explore finite size effects and T-duality maps on the
description of Wilson loops by supergravity.
