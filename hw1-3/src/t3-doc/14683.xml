Lectures On Black Hole Evaporation and Information Loss
</title>

<abstract>
  Trieste Spring School Lectures describing the author's opinions about black
hole evaporation and information loss. The remnant, or cornucopion scenario for
the endpoint of Hawking evaporation is described in detail. In this picture
information can be lost to the original asymptotic observer without violating
the rules of quantum mechanics, because a black hole remnant is viewed as a
large space connected onto our own by an almost pointlike opening. It does not
behave like an elementary particle. Objections to remnants are refuted and the
(remote) possibility of testing this scenario experimentally is discussed. Also
included is a brief description of Susskind's picture of the stringy origin of
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. An attempt is made to argue that the cornucopion
picture and Susskind's model of the states responsible for black hole entropy
are compatible with each other. Information is lost to the asymptotic observer
in Hawking evaporation, but the information encoded in the BH entropy remains
in causal contact with him and is re-emitted with the Hawking radiation.
