Geometric construction of new Yang-Mills instantons over Taub-NUT space
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we exhibit a one-parameter family of new Taub-NUT instantons
parameterized by a half-line. The endpoint of the half-line will be the
reducible Yang-Mills instanton corresponding to the Eguchi-Hanson-Gibbons L^2
harmonic 2-form, while at an inner point we recover the Pope-Yuille instanton
constructed as a projection of the Levi-Civita connection onto the positive
su(2) subalgebra of the Lie algebra so(4).
  Our method imitates the Jackiw-Nohl-Rebbi construction originally designed
for flat R^4. That is we find a one-parameter family of harmonic functions on
the Taub-NUT space with a point singularity, rescale the metric and project the
obtained Levi-Civita connection onto the other negative su(2) subalgebra of
so(4). Our solutions will possess the full U(2) symmetry, and thus provide more
solutions to the recently proposed U(2) symmetric ansatz of Kim and Yoon.
