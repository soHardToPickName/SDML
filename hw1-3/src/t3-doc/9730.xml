<title>
Discrete scalar fields and general relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  The physical meaning, the properties and the consequences of a discrete
scalar field are discussed; limits for a continuous mathematical description of
fundamental physics is a natural outcome of discrete fields with discrete
interactions. The discrete scalar field is ultimately the gravitational field
of general relativity, necessarily, and there is no place for any other
fundamental scalar field, in this context.
