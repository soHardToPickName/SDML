Wilson loops in large N field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a method to calculate the expectation values of an operator
similar to the Wilson loop in the large N limit of field theories. We consider
N=4 3+1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills. The prescription involves calculating the
area of a fundamental string worldsheet in certain supergravity backgrounds. We
also consider the case of coincident M-theory fivebranes where one is lead to
calculating the area of M-theory two-branes. We briefly discuss the computation
for 2+1 dimensional super-Yang-Mills with sixteen supercharges which is
non-conformal. In all these cases we calculate the energy of quark-antiquark
pair.
