Closed String Tachyons, Non-Supersymmetric Orbifolds and Generalised
  McKay Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We study closed string tachyon condensation on general non-supersymmetric
orbifolds of C^2. Extending previous analyses on Abelian cases, we present the
classification of quotients by discrete finite subgroups of GL(2; C) as well as
the generalised Hirzebruch-Jung continued fractions associated with the
resolution data. Furthermore, we discuss the intimate connexions with certain
generalised versions of the McKay Correspondence.
