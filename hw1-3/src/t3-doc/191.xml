Measuring the $W$-hair of String Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We have argued previously that the infinitely many gauge symmetries of string
theory provide an infinite set of conserved (gauge) quantum numbers ($W$-hair)
which characterise black hole states and maintain quantum coherence. Here we
study ways of measuring the $W$-hair of spherically-symmetric four-dimensional
objects with event horizons, treated as effectively two-dimensional string
black holes. Measurements can be done either through the s-wave scattering of
light particles off the string black-hole background, or through interference
experiments of Aharonov-Bohm type. In the first type of measurement, selection
