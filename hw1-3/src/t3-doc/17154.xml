<title>
Once again on the equivalence theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the proof of the equivalence theorem in quantum field theory which
is based on a formulation of this problem in the field-antifield formalism. As
an example, we consider a model in which a different choices of natural finite
counterterms is possible, leading to physically non-equivalent quantum theories
while the equivalent theorem remains valid.
