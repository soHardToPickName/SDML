Temperature Correlations of Quantum Spins
</title>

<abstract>
  Isotropic XY is considered. It describes interaction of quantum spins on
1-dimesional lattice. Alternatevly one can call the model XXO Hiesenberg
antiferromagnet. We solved long standing problem of evaluation of temperature
corelations. We proved that correlation function of the model is $\tau $
function of Ablowitz-Ladik PDE. We explicitly evaluated asymptotics.
