<title>
Conformal Anomaly and Large Scale Gravitational Coupling
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a model in which the breackdown of conformal symmetry of a quantum
stress-tensor due to the trace anomaly is related to a cosmological effect in a
gravitational model. This is done by characterizing the traceless part of the
quantum stress-tensor in terms of the stress-tensor of a conformal invariant
classical scalar field. We introduce a conformal frame in which the anomalous
trace is identified with a cosmological constant. In this conformal frame we
establish the Einstein field equations by connecting the quantum stress-tensor
with the large scale distribution of matter in the universe.
