Aspects of Tachyonic Inflation with Exponential Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider issues related to tachyonic inflation with exponential potential.
We find exact solution of evolution equations in the slow roll limit in FRW
cosmology. We also carry out similar analysis in case of Brane assisted
tachyonic inflation. We investigate the phase space behavior of the system and
show that the dust like solution is a late time attractor. The difficulties
associated with reheating in the tachyonic model are also indicated.
