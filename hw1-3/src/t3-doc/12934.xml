Current Algebra in the Path Integral framework
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we describe an approach to the current algebra based in the
Path Integral formalism. We use this method for abelian and non-abelian quantum
field theories in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions and the correct expressions are
obtained. Our results show the independence of the regularization of the
current algebras.
