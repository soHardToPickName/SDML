Non-Abelian Thermal Large Gauge Transformations in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss several different constructions of non-Abelian large gauge
transformations at finite temperature. Pisarski's ansatz with even winding
number is related to Hopf mappings, and we present a simple new ansatz that has
any integer winding number at finite temperature.
