Holomorphic Tachyons and Fractional D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study tachyon condensation on brane-antibrane systems in orbifold theories
from the viewpoint of boundary string field theory. We show that the
condensation of holomorphic tachyon fields generates various fractional
D-branes. The boundary N=2 supersymmetry in the world-sheet theory ensures this
result exactly. Furthermore, our results are consistent with the twisted
RR-charges from detailed calculations of boundary states. We also discuss the
generation of RR-charges due to holomorphic tachyon fields on multiple
brane-antibrane pairs in flat space.
