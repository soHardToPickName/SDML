<title>
The Effective K\"ahler Potential And Extra Space-Time Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The effects of extra space-time dimensions on the Wilsonian effective
K\"ahler potential and the perturbative one loop effective K\"ahler potential
are determined within the framework of an Abelian gauge theory with N=2
supersymmetric field content. The relation between the K\"ahler metric and the
effective gauge couplings which leads to the absence of radiative corrections
to the K\"ahler potential is expressed as a function of the radius of
compactification of a fifth dimension. In general, the quantum corrections to
the low energy K\"ahler potential are shown to grow with this radius reflecting
the underlying higher dimensional nature of the theory.
