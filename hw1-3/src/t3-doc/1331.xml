Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Thermodynamics of Black Holes in de Sitter
  Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We continue the study of thermodynamics of black holes in de Sitter spaces.
In a previous paper (hep-th/0111093), we have shown that the entropy of
cosmological horizon in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution and topological de
Sitter solution can be expressed in a form of the Cardy-Verlinde formula, if
one adopts the prescription to compute the gravitational mass from data at
early or late time infinity of de Sitter space. However, this definition of
gravitational mass cannot give a similar expression like the Cardy-Verlinde
formula for the entropy associated with the horizon of black holes in de Sitter
spaces. In this paper, we first generalize the previous discussion to the case
of Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter solutions. Furthermore, we
find that the entropy of black hole horizon can also be rewritten in terms of
the Cardy-Verlinde formula for these black holes in de Sitter spaces, if we use
the definition due to Abbott and Deser for conserved charges in asymptotically
de Sitter spaces. We discuss the implication of our result. In addition, we
give the first law of de Sitter black hole mechanics.
