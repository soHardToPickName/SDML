<title>
Finite Tensor Deformations of Supergravity Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider brane solutions where the tensor degrees of freedom are excited.
Explicit solutions to the full non-linear supergravity equations of motion are
given for the M5 and D3 branes, corresponding to finite selfdual tensor or
Born-Infeld field strengths. The solutions are BPS-saturated and
half-supersymmetric. The resulting metric space-times are analysed.
