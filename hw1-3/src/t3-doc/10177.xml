<title>
Background-metric Independent Formulation of 4D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the background-metric independence for the traceless mode as well as
the conformal mode, 4D quantum gravity is described as a quantum field theory
defined on a non-dynamical background-metric. The measure then induces an
action with 4 derivatives. So we think that 4-th order gravity is essential and
the Einstein-Hilbert term should be treated like a mass term. We introduce the
dimensionless self-coupling constant t for the traceless mode. In this paper we
study a model where the measure can be evaluated in the limit $t \to 0$
exactly, using the background-metric independence for the conformal mode. The
t-dependence of the measure is determined perturbatively using the
background-metric independence for the traceless mode.
