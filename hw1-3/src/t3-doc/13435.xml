Loop Equations for the d-dimensional One-Hermitian Matrix model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the loop equations for the one Hermitian matrix model in any
dimension. These are a consequence of the Schwinger-Dyson equations of the
model. Moreover we show that in leading order of large $N$ the loop equations
form a closed set.
