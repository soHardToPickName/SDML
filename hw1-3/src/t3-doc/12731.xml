Magnetic backgrounds and tachyonic instabilities in closed string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some aspects of closed superstrings in Melvin-type magnetic
backgrounds. A 2-parameter family of such NS-NS backgrounds are exactly
solvable as weakly coupled string models with the spectrum containing tachyonic
modes. Magnetic field allows one to interpolate between free superstring
theories with periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions for the space-time
fermions around some compact direction, and, in particular, between type 0 and
type II string theories. Using ``9-11'' flip, this interpolation can be
extended to M-theory and may be used to study the issue of tachyon in type 0
string theory. We review, following hep-th/0104238, related duality proposals,
and, in particular, consider a description of type 0 theory in terms of
M-theory in a curved magnetic flux background in which the type 0 tachyon
appears to correspond to a state in $d=11$ supergravity fluctuation spectrum.
