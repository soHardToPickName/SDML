<title>
The Alf'ven Effect and Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Noting that two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics can be modeled by conformal
field theory, we argue that when the Alf'ven effect is also taken into account
one is naturally lead to consider conformal field theories, which have
logarithmic terms in their correlation functions. We discuss the implications
of such logarithmic terms in the context of magnetohydrodynamics, and derive a
relationship between conformal dimensions of the velocity stream function, the
magnetic flux function and the Reynolds number.
