Rogers dilogarithm in integrable systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We dicuss some curious aspects of the Rogers dilogarithm and the functional
relations in integrable systems in two dimensions. This is for the proceedings
of the XX1 Differential Geometry Methods in Theoretical Physics, Tianjin,
China, 5-9 June 1992.
