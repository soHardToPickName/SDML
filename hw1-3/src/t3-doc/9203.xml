<title>
Neutron Acceleration in Uniform Electromagnetic Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The question as to whether neutron acceleration can occur in uniform
electromagnetic fields is examined. Although such an effect has been predicted
using the canonical equations of motion some doubt has been raised recently as
to whether it is in principle observable for a spin 1/2 particle. To resolve
this issue a gedanken experiment is proposed and analyzed using a wave packet
construction for the neutron beam. By allowing arbitrary orientation for the
neutron spin as well as for the electric and magnetic fields a non vanishing
acceleration of the center of the neutron wave packet is found which confirms
the predictions of the canonical formalism.
