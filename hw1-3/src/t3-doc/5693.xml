<title>
On knots in subdivergent diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate Feynman diagrams which are calculable in terms of generalized
one-loop functions, and explore how the presence or absence of transcendentals
in their counterterms reflects the entanglement of link diagram constructed
from them and explains unexpected relations between them.
