Exact absorption probabilities for the D3-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a minimal scalar in the presence of a three-brane in ten
dimensions. The linearized equation of motion, which is just the wave equation
in the three-brane metric, can be solved in terms of associated Mathieu
functions. An exact expression for the reflection and absorption probabilities
can be obtained in terms of the characteristic exponent of Mathieu's equation.
We describe an algorithm for obtaining the low-energy behavior as a series
expansion, and discuss the implications for the world-volume theory of
D3-branes.
