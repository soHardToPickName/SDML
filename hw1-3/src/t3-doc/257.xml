The String Light Cone in the pp-wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter, we determine the particle and the string light cone in the
pp-wave background. The result is a deformed version of the flat one. We point
out the light cone exhibits an intriguing periodicity in the light cone time
direction x^+ with a period \sim 1/ \mu. Our results also suggest that a
quantum theory in the pp-wave background can be formulated consistently only if
the background is periodic in the light cone time x^+.
