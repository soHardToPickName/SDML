Ward Identities for N=2 Rigid and Local Supersymmetry in Euclidean Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct and check by explicit Feynman diagram calculations the BRST Ward
identities for N=2 rigid super Yang-Mills theory and N=2 extended supergravity
in four-dimensional Euclidean space without auxiliary fields. We use the
Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. In the supergravity case we need one new
contractible pair of complex spinor fields to obtain the usual gauge-fixing
term and corresponding Nielsen-Kallosh ghosts.
