Supersymmetry without Grassmann Variables
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetry transformations may be represented by unitary operators in a
formulation of supersymmetry without numbers that anti-commute. The physical
relevance of this formulation hinges on whether or not one may add states of
even and odd fermion number, a question which soon may be settled by
experiment.
