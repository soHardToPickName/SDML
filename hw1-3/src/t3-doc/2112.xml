<title>
Dual versions of N=2 supergravity and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, using a model of N=2 supergravity - vector multiplets
interaction with the scalar field geometry $SU(1,m)/SU(m)\otimes U(1)$ as an
example, we show that even when the geometry is fixed one can have a whole
family of the Lagrangians that differ by the vector field duality
transformations. As a byproduct, for this geometry we have constructed a model
of (m-1) vector multiplets interacting with the hidden sector admitting
spontaneous supersymmetry breaking with two arbitrary scales and without a
cosmological term.
