<title>
Tachyon Condensates and Anisotropic Universe
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the cosmological solutions in closed bosonic string theory in
the presence of non zero tachyon condensate. We specifically obtain time
dependent solutions which describe an anisotropic universe. We also discuss the
nature of such time dependent solutions when small tachyon fluctuations around
the condensate are taken into account.
