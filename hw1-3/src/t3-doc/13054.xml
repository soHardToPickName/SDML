<title>
Mechanics as Geometry?
</title>

<abstract>
  Talk given at the Workshop on "Constraint Theory and Quantization Methods";
Montepulciano, Italy, June 1993 --- Instead of attempting to give a summary or
to identify highlights of the workshop, the history of the development of
analytical mechanics is outlined, with an emphasis on the themes of \lq natural
motion' and the variational principle.
