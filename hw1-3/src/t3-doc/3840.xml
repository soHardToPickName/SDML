On supersymmetric $Dp - \bar D p$ brane solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze in the spirit of hep-th/0110039 the possible existence of
supersymmetric $D p - \bar D p$ brane systems in flat ten dimensional Minkowski
space. For $p=3,4$ we show that besides the solutions related by T-duality to
the $D2 - \bar D 2$ systems found by Bak and Karch there exist other ansatz
whose compatibility is shown from general arguments and that preserve also
eight supercharges, in particular a $D4 - \bar D4$ system with D2-branes
dissolved on it and Taub-NUT charge. We carry out the explicit construction in
Weyl basis of the corresponding Killing spinors and conjecture the existence of
new solutions for higher dimensional branes with some compact directions
analogous to the supertube recently found.
