<title>
Effective Lagrangian for self-interacting scalar field theories in
  curved spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a self-interacting scalar field theory in a slowly varying
gravitational background field. Using zeta-function regularization and
heat-kernel techniques, we derive the one-loop effective Lagrangian up to
second order in the variation of the background field and up to quadratic terms
in the curvature tensors. Specializing to different spacetimes of physical
interest, the influence of the curvature on the phase transition is considered.
