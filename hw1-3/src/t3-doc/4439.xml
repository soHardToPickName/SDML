Collective Dynamics of Solitons and Inequivalent Quantizations
</title>

<abstract>
  The collective dynamics of solitons with a coset space G/H as moduli space is
studied. It is shown that the collective band for a vibrational state is given
by the inequivalent coset space quantization corresponding to the
representation of H carried by the vibration.
