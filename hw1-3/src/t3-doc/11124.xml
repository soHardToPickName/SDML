Reflection K-Matrices of the 19-Vertex Model and XXZ Spin-1 Chain with
  General Boundary Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive and classify all solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation (or
the reflection equation) for the 19-vertex model associated with
$U_q(\widehat{sl_2})$. Integrable $XXZ$ spin-1 chain hamiltonian with general
boundary interactions is also obtained.
