Topological Phases of the Heterotic String
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the phase structure of topological Calabi--Yau manifolds defined
on the moduli space of instantons. We show in this framework that topological
vacua describe new phases of the Heterotic String theory in which the flat
directions corresponding to complex deformations are lifted. We also briefly
discuss the phase structure of non--K\"ahler manifolds.
