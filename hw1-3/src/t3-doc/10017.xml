Renormalisation in Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a recently proposed quantum action depending on temperature. We
construct a renormalisation group equation describing the flow of action
parameters with temperature. At zero temperature the quantum action is obtained
analytically and is found free of higher time derivatives. It makes the quantum
action an ideal tool to investigate quantum chaos and quantum instantons.
