Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for N = 1 Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a series of $N\!=\!1$ supersymmetric integrable particle theories in
$d=1+1$ dimensions. These theories are represented as integrable perturbations
of specific $N\!=\!1$ superconformal field theories. Starting from the
conjectured $S$-matrices for these theories, we develop the Thermodynamic Bethe
Ansatz (TBA), where we use that the 2-particle $S$-matrices satisfy a free
fermion condition. Our analysis proves a conjecture by E.~Melzer, who proposed
that these $N\!=\!1$ supersymmetric TBA systems are ``folded'' versions of
$N\!=\!2$ supersymmetric TBA systems that were first studied by P.~Fendley and
K.~Intriligator.
