<title>
Generation of multipole moments by external field in Born-Infeld
  non-linear electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The mechanism for the generation of multipole moments due to an external
field is presented for the Born-Infeld charged particle. The 'polarizability
coefficient' for arbitrary l-pole moment is calculated. The l-th coefficient is
proportional to the (2l+1)-th power of the characteristic length in the
Born-Infeld theory. Physical implications are discussed.
