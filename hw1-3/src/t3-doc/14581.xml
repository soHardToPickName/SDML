Towards Quantum Cosmology without Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigate the vanishing of cosmological singularities by
quantization. Starting from a 5d Kaluza--Klein approach we quantize, as a first
step, the non--spherical metric part and the dilaton field. These fields which
are classically singular become smooth after quantization. In addition, we
argue that the incorporation of non perturbative quantum corrections form a
dilaton potential. Technically, the procedure corresponds to the quantization
of 2d dilaton gravity and we discuss several models. From the 4d point of view
this procedure is a semiclassical approach where only the dilaton and moduli
matter fields are quantized.
