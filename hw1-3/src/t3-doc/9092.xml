Perturbative gauge invariance: electroweak theory II
</title>

<abstract>
  A recent construction of the electroweak theory, based on perturbative
quantum gauge invariance alone, is extended to the case of more generations of
fermions with arbitrary mixing. The conditions implied by second order gauge
invariance lead to an isolated solution for the fermionic couplings in
agreement with the standard model. Third order gauge invariance determines the
Higgs potential. The resulting massive gauge theory is manifestly gauge
invariant, after construction.
