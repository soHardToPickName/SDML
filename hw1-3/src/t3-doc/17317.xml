<title>
An Algorithm for the Microscopic Evaluation of the Coefficients of the
  Seiberg-Witten Prepotential
</title>

<abstract>
  A procedure, allowing to calculate the coefficients of the SW prepotential in
the framework of the instanton calculus is presented. As a demonstration
explicit calculations for 2, 3 and 4- instanton contributions are carried out.
