Noncommutative N=2 Supersymmetric Theories in Harmonic Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a formulation of harmonic superspace approach for noncommuative
N=2 supersymmetric field theories paying main attention on new features arising
because of noncommutativity. We begin with the known notions of the harmonic
superfield models and results obtained and consider how these notions and
results are modified in the noncommutative case. The actions of basic N=2
models, like hypermultiplet and N=2 vector multiplet, are given in terms of
unconstrained off-shell superfields on noncommutative harmonic superspace. We
calculate the low-energy contributions to the effective actions of these
models. The background field method in noncommutative harmonic superspace is
developed and it is applied to study the 1-loop effective action in general
noncommutative N=2 model and N=4 SYM theory.
