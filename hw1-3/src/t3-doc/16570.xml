<title>
4-dimensional dilaton black holes with cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  Static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with non-zero
cosmological constant are investigated. A formal power series solution is
found. It is proved that the number of regular horizons is less than or equal
to 2 for positive cosmological constant and is less than or equal to 1 for
negative cosmological constant. This shows a striking contrast to the fact that
the Reissner-Nordstr{\o}m-de Sitter black hole with positive cosmological
horizon has 3 regular horizons.
