Bosonic Casimir effect in external magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the influence of an external magnetic field on the Casimir energy
of a massive charged scalar field confined between two parallel infinite
plates. For this case the obtained result shows that the magnetic field
inhibits the Casimir effect.
