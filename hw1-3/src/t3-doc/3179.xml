Dyons with axial symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct axially symmetric dyons in SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs theory. In the
Prasad-Sommerfield limit, they are obtained via scaling relations from axially
symmetric multimonopole solutions. For finite Higgs self-coupling they are
constructed numerically.
