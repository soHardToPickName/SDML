Self-dual vortex-like configurations in SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there are solutions of the SU(2) Yang-Mills classical equations
of motion in R^4, which are self-dual and vortex-like(fluxons). The action
density is concentrated along a thick two-dimensional wall (the world sheet of
a straight infinite vortex line). The configurations are constructed from
self-dual R^2 x T^2 configurations.
