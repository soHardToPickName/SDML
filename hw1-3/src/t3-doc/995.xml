On the Electromagnetic Interactions of Anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the appropriate representation of the Poincare group and a definition
of minimal coupling, we discuss some aspects of the electromagnetic
interactions of charged anyons. In a nonrelativistic expansion, we derive a
Schrodinger-type equation for the anyon wave function which includes
spin-magnetic field and spin-orbit couplings. In particular, the gyromagnetic
ratio for charged anyons is shown to be 2; this last result is essentially a
reflection of the fact that the spin is parallel to the momentum in (2+1)
dimensions.
