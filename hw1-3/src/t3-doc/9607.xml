<title>
Large N 2D Yang-Mills Theory and Topological String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a topological string theory which reproduces many aspects of the
1/N expansion of SU(N) Yang-Mills theory in two spacetime dimensions in the
zero coupling (A=0) limit. The string theory is a modified version of
topological gravity coupled to a topological sigma model with spacetime as
target. The derivation of the string theory relies on a new interpretation of
Gross and Taylor's ``\Omega^{-1} points.'' We describe how inclusion of the
area, coupling of chiral sectors, and Wilson loop expectation values can be
incorporated in the topological string approach.
