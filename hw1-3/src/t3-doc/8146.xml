<title>
Constrained Analysis of Topologically Massive Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We quantize the Einstein gravity in the formalism of weak gravitational
fields by using the constrained Hamiltonian method. Special emphasis is given
to the 2+1 spacetime dimensional case where a (topological) Chern-Simons term
is added to the Lagrangian.
