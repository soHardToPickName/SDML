Evaporation of Schwarzschild Black Hole in the Large N Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  By using the D0-brane cluster picture, we consider the Hawking radiation of
Schwarszchild black hole (SBH) in large N Matrix model. We get the correct
formula for the the Hawing evaporation rate. Our results give some evidence on
the Lorentz invariance of the physics of Matrix model.
