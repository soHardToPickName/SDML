<title>
Towards a Strong Coupling Liouville Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A possibility of strong coupling quantum Liouville gravity is investigated
via infinite dimensional representations of $\qslc$ with $q$ at a root of
unity. It is explicitly shown that vertex operator in this model can be written
by a tensor product of a vertex operator of the classical Liouville theory and
that of weak coupling quantum Liouville theory. Some discussions about the
strong coupling Liouville gravity within this formulation are given.
