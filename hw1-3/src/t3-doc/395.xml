<title>
Quantum fluctuations of the Chern-Simons theory and dynamical
  dimensional reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a large-N Chern-Simons theory for the attractive bosonic matter
(Jackiw-Pi model) in the Hamiltonian collective-field approach based on the 1/N
expansion. We show that the dynamics of low-lying density excitations around
the ground-state vortex configuration is equivalent to that of the Sutherland
model. The relationship between the Chern-Simons coupling constant lambda and
the Calogero-Sutherland statistical parameter lambda_s signalizes some sort of
statistical transmutation accompanying the dimensional reduction of the initial
problem.
