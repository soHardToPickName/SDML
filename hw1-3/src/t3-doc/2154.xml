Pseudoscalar and vector correlations in instanton vacuum model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, that the correct account of quark interaction generated by
instanton medium gives the possibility of description on the same ground of
both pseudoscalar channel and low lying bound states in the vector channel. It
must be noted, that all calculations are made in the approximation, taking into
account only zero modes.
