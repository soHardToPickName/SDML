N=2 Supersymmetric Gauged O(3) Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the N=2 supersymmetric extension of the gauged O(3) sigma model in
(2+1) dimensions with an abelian Chern-Simons term. It is shown that the
self-dual potential and the Bogomolny relations naturally appear as
consequences of extended supersymmetry.
