Four-dimensional High-Branes as Intersecting D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a class of extremal four-dimensional supersymmetric
``high-branes'', i.e. string and domain wall solutions, can be interpreted as
intersections of four ten-dimensional Dirichlet branes. These $d=4$ solutions
are related, via $T$-duality in ten dimensions, to the four-dimensional
extremal Maxwell/scalar black holes that are characterized by a scalar
coupling parameter $a$ with $a=0,1/\sqrt{3}, 1, \sqrt{3}$.
