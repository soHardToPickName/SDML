Domain wall junctions in a generalized Wess-Zumino model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate domain wall junctions in a generalized Wess-Zumino model with
a Z(N) symmetry. We present a method to identify the junctions which are
potentially BPS saturated. We then use a numerical simulation to show that
those junctions indeed saturate the BPS bound for N=4. In addition, we study
the decay of unstable non-BPS junctions.
