<title>
The Meson Model on the Basis of the String Solution of the Heisenberg
  Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The axially symmetric non-local solution in the Heisenberg equation is found.
It is regular in the whole space and has the finite energy on the unit of
length according to this we may consider the solution as a string. Taking the
non-local spherically symmetric solution, which was found by Finkelstein et.
al., and our solution in account we suggest to consider the Heisenberg equation
as a quantum equation for non-local objects (strings, flux tubes, membranes and
so on). The received solution is used for the obtaining the meson model as a
rotating string with the quark on its ends.
