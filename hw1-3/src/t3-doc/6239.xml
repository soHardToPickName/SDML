Exact S-matrices for d_{n+1}^{(2)} affine Toda solitons and their bound
  states
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture an exact S-matrix for the scattering of solitons in
$d_{n+1}^{(2)}$ affine Toda field theory in terms of the R-matrix of the
quantum group $U_q(c_n^{(1)})$. From this we construct the scattering
amplitudes for all scalar bound states (breathers) of the theory. This S-matrix
conjecture is justified by detailed examination of its pole structure. We show
that a breather-particle identification holds by comparing the S-matrix
elements for the lowest breathers with the S-matrix for the quantum particles
in real affine Toda field theory, and discuss the implications for various
forms of duality.
