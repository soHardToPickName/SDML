<title>
Finite size corrections in two dimensional gauge theories and a
  quantitative chiral test of the overlap
</title>

<abstract>
  An argument is presented for a certain universality of finite size
corrections in two dimensional gauge theories. In the abelian case a direct
calculation is carried out for a particular chiral model. The analytical result
confirms the above universality and that the 't Hooft vertex previously
measured using the overlap smoothly approaches the correct continuum limit
within statistical errors.
