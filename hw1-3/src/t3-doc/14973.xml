Logarithmic Operators and Dynamical Extention of The Symmetry Group in
  the Bosonic SU(2)_0 and SUSY SU(2)_2 WZNW Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the operator product expansion in the bosonic $SU(2)_0$ and SUSY
$SU(2)_2$ WZNW models. We find that these OPEs contain both logarithmic
operators and new conserved currents, leading to an extension of the symmetry
group.
