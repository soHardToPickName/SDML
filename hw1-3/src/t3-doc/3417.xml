<title>
Determinant Line Bundles and Topological Invariants of Hyperbolic
  Geometry - Expository Remarks
</title>

<abstract>
  We give some remarks on twisted determinant line bundles and Chern-Simons
topological invariants associated with real hyperbolic manifolds. Index of a
twisted Dirac operator is derived. We discuss briefly application of obtained
results in topological quantum field theory.
