<title>
Superconducting Knot Solitons in Weinberg-Salam Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the existence of stable knot solitons in the standard
electroweak theory whose topological quantum number $\pi_3(S^3)$ is fixed by
the Higgs doublet. The electroweak knots are made of the helical hypermagnetic
flux tube which has a non-trivial dressing of the Higgs field, and carry a net
supercurrent made of W-boson. We estimate the mass of the lightest knot to be
around 15 TeV, and propose that the knots could be an ideal candidate of
superconducting cosmic string.
