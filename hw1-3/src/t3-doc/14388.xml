Chern-Simons terms and the Three Notions of Charge
</title>

<abstract>
  In theories with Chern-Simons terms or modified Bianchi identities, it is
useful to define three notions of either electric or magnetic charge associated
with a given gauge field. A language for discussing these charges is introduced
and the properties of each charge are described. `Brane source charge' is gauge
invariant and localized but not conserved or quantized, `Maxwell charge' is
gauge invariant and conserved but not localized or quantized, while `Page
charge' conserved, localized, and quantized but not gauge invariant. This
provides a further perspective on the issue of charge quantization recently
raised by Bachas, Douglas, and Schweigert.
