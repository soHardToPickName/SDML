The Cardy-Verlinde Formula and Topological AdS-Schwarzschild Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the brane universe in the background of the topological
AdS-Schwarzschild black holes. The induced geometry of the brane is that of a
flat or an open radiation dominated FRW-universe. Just like the case of a
closed radiation dominated FRW-universe, the temperature and entropy are simply
expressed in terms of the Hubble parameter and its time derivative when the
brane crosses the black hole horizon. We propose the modified Cardy-Verlinde
formula which is valid for any values of the curvature parameter k in the
Friedmann equations.
