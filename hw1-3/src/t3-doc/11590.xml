<title>
The uses of Connes and Kreimer's algebraic formulation of
  renormalization theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how, modulo the distinction between the antipode and the "twisted" or
"renormalized" antipode, Connes and Kreimer's algebraic paradigm trivializes
the proofs of equivalence of the (corrected) Dyson-Salam,
Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp and Zimmermann procedures for renormalizing Feynman
amplitudes. We discuss the outlook for a parallel simplification of
computations in quantum field theory, stemming from the same algebraic
approach.
