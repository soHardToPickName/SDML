Bound States of the Hydrogen Atom in the Presence of a Magnetic Monopole
  Field and an Aharonov-Bohm Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present article we analyze the bound states of an electron in a
Coulomb field when an Aharonov-Bohm field as well as a magnetic Dirac monopole
are present. We solve, via separation of variables, the Schr\"odinger equation
in spherical coordinates and we show how the Hydrogen energy spectrum depends
on the Aharonov-Bohm and the magnetic monopole strengths. In passing, the
Klein-Gordon equation is solved.
