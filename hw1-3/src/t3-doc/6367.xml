<title>
SO(N) invariant Wess-Zumino action and its quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  A consistent quantization procedure of anomalous chiral models is discussed.
It is based on the modification of the classical action by adding Wess-Zumino
terms. The $SO(3)$ invariant WZ action for the $SO(3)$ model is constructed.
Quantization of the corresponding modified theory is considered in details.
