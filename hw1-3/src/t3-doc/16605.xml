<title>
Non-perturbative summation over 3D discrete topologies
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a group field theory which realizes the sum of gravity
amplitudes over all three dimensional topologies trough a perturbative
expansion. We prove this theory to be uniquely Borel summable. This shows how
to define a non-perturbative summation over triangulations including all
topologies in the context of three dimensional discrete gravity.
