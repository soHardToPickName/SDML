Physical states in $N = 1$ supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  By solving the supersymmetry constraints for physical wave-functions, it is
shown that the only two allowed bosonic states in $ N = 1 $ supergravity are of
the form const.~exp~$(\pm I / \hbar) $, where $ I $ is an action functional of
the three-metric. States containing a finite number of fermions are forbidden.
In the case that the spatial topology is $ S^3 $, the state const.~exp~$(- I /
\hbar)$ is the wormhole ground state, and the state const.~exp~$(I / \hbar)$ is
the Hartle--Hawking state. $ N = 1 $ supergravity has no quantum ultraviolet
divergences, and no quantum corrections.
