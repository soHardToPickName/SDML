<title>
Exact expectation values of local fields in quantum sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an explicit expression for vacuum expectation values of the
exponential fields in the sine-Gordon model. Our expression agrees both with
semi-classical results in the sine-Gordon theory and with perturbative
calculations in the Massive Thirring model. We use this expression to make new
predictions about the large-distance asymptotic form of the two-point
correlation function in the XXZ spin chain.
