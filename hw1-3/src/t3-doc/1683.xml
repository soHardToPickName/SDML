<title>
Quasi-Exactly Solvable Models with Spin-Orbital Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  First examples of quasi-exactly solvable models describing spin-orbital
interaction are constructed. In contrast with other examples of matrix
quasi-exactly solvable models discussed in the literature up to now, our models
admit (but still incomplete) sets of exact (algebraic) solutions.
