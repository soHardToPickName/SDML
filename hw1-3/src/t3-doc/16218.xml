<title>
Non-perturbative Solutions to N=2 Supersymmetric Yang-Mills Theories
  -Progress and Perspective-
</title>

<abstract>
  This note reviews the progress on the low energy dynamics of N=2
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories after the works of Seiberg and Witten.
Specifically, the theory of prepotential for non-specialists is reviewed.
