Noncommutative Einstein-AdS Gravity in three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a Lorentzian version of three-dimensional noncommutative
Einstein-AdS gravity by making use of the Chern-Simons formulation of pure
gravity in 2+1 dimensions. The deformed action contains a real, symmetric
metric and a real, antisymmetric tensor that vanishes in the commutative limit.
These fields are coupled to two abelian gauge fields. We find that this theory
of gravity is invariant under a class of transformations that reduce to
standard diffeomorphisms once the noncommutativity parameter is set to zero.
