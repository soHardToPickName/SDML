Bound states in bottomless potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider classical and quantum dynamics on potentials that are
asymptotically unbounded from below. By explicit construction we find that
quantum bound states can exist in certain bottomless potentials. The classical
dynamics in these potentials is novel. Only a set of zero measure of classical
trajectories can escape to infinity. All other trajectories get trapped as they
get further out into the asymptotic region.
