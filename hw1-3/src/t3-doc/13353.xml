<title>
Study of $N=2$ Superconformal Field Theories in $4$ Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Making use of the exact solutions of the $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories
we construct new classes of superconformal field theories (SCFTs) by
fine-tuning the moduli parameters and bringing the theories to critical points.
SCFTs we have constructed represent universality classes of the 4-dimensional
$N=2$ SCFTs.
