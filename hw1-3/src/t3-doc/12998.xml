Kaluza-Klein Vortices
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static vortex type solutions of pure gravity for $D \geq 4+1 $.
Non-singular vortex solutions can be obtained by considering periodic
Kaluza-Klein monopoles. We also show that away from the center of the vortices
the space is described by the gravitational instantons derived from minimal
surfaces.
