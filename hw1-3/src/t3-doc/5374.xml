Supersymmetry Transformation of Quantum Fields II: Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the transformation law of quantum fields in super Yang-Mills theory
quantized in the Wess-Zumino gauge. It can be derived from a local version of
generalized Slavnov-Taylor identities for general Green functions. Under
suitable normalization conditions the transformations are local. Within the
vector multiplet anomalous dimensions become equal. The breaking of susy shows
up in Fock but not in Hilbert space and is not reflected in the transformation
law for the fields.
