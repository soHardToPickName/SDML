Generalized Stochastic Gauge Fixing
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a generalization of the stochastic gauge fixing procedure for the
stochastic quantization of gauge theories where not only the drift term of the
stochastic process is changed but also the Wiener process itself. All gauge
invariant expectation values remain unchanged. As an explicit example we study
the case of an abelian gauge field coupled with three bosonic matter fields in
0+1 dimensions. We nonperturbatively prove quivalence with the path integral
formalism.
