Schwinger-Dyson and Large $N_{c}$ Loop Equation for Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive an infinite sequence of Schwinger-Dyson equations for $N=1$
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The fundamental and the only variable
employed is the Wilson-loop geometrically represented in $N=1$ superspace: it
organizes an infinite number of supersymmetrizing insertions into the ordinary
Wilson-loop as a single entity. In the large $N_{c}$ limit, our equation
becomes a closed loop equation for the one-point function of the Wilson-loop
average.
