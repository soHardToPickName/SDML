Physical Meaning of Quantum Space-Time Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  A definition is given and the physical meaning of quantum transformations of
a non-commutative configuration space (quantum group coactions) is discussed.
It is shown that non-commutative coordinates which are transformed by quantum
groups are the natural generalization of the notion of a tensor operator for
usual groups and that the quantum group coactions induce semigroups of
transformations of states of a system. Two examples of non-commutative
transformations and the corresponding semigroups are considered.
