Non-Abelian BFFT embedding, Schr\"odinger quantization and the anomaly
  of the O(N) nonlinear sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  We embed the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in a non-Abelian gauge theory. As a
first class system, it is quantized using two different approaches: the
functional Schr\"odinger method and the non-local field-antifield procedure.
Firstly, the quantization is performed with the functional Schr\"{o}dinger
method, for N=2, obtaining the wave functionals for the ground and excited
states. In the second place, using the BV formalism we compute the one-loop
anomaly. This important result shows that the classical gauge symmetries,
appearing due to the conversion via BFFT method, are broken at the quantum
level.
