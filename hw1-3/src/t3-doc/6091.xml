<title>
Elliptic Singularities, \theta-Puzzle and Domain Walls
</title>

<abstract>
  We study N=1 four dimensional gluodynamics in the context of M-theory
compactifications on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau fourfolds. Gaugino
condensates, \theta-dependence, Witten index and domain walls are considered
for singularities of type $\hat{A}_{n-1}$ and $\hat{D}_{n+4}$. It is shown how
the topology of intersections among the irreducible components defining the
singular elliptic fiber, determine the entanglement of vacua and the appareance
of domain walls.
