Gravitational Duality, Branes and Charges
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that D=10 type II strings and M-theory in D=11 have D-5 branes
and 9-branes that are not standard p-branes coupled to anti-symmetric tensors.
The global charges in a D-dimensional theory of gravity consist of a momentum
$P_M$ and a dual D-5 form charge $K_{M_1...M_{D-5}}$, which is related to the
NUT charge. On dimensional reduction, P gives the electric charge and K the
magnetic charge of the graviphoton. The charge K is constructed and shown to
occur in the superalgebra and BPS bounds in $D\ge 5$, and leads to a NUT-charge
modification of the BPS bound in D=4. $K$ is carried by Kaluza-Klein monopoles,
which can be regarded as D-5 branes. Supersymmetry and U-duality imply that the
type IIB theory has (p,q) 9-branes. Orientifolding with 32 (0,1) 9-branes gives
the type I string, while modding out by a related discrete symmetry with 32
(1,0) 9-branes gives the SO(32) heterotic string. Symmetry enhancement, the
effective world-volume theories and the possibility of a twelve dimensional
origin are discussed.
