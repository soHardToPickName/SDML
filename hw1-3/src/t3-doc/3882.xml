Beyond CFT : Deformed Virasoro and Elliptic Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture we discuss `beyond CFT' from symmetry point of view. After
reviewing the Virasoro algebra, we introduce deformed Virasoro algebras and
elliptic algebras. These algebras appear in solvable lattice models and we
study them by free field approach.
