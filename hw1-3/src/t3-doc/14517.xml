<title>
Quantum Dynamical Model for Wave Function Reduction in Classical and
  Macroscopic Limits
</title>

<abstract>
  In this papper, a quantum dynamical model describing the quantum measurement
process is presented as an extensive generalization of the Coleman-Hepp model.
In both the classical limit with very large quantum number and macroscopic
limit with very large particle number in measuring instrument, this model
generally realizes the wave packet collapse in quantum measurement as a
consequence of the Schrodinger time evolution in either the exactly-solvable
case or the non-(exactly-)solvable case.
  For the latter, its quasi-adiabatic case is explicitly analysed by making use
of the high-order adiabatic approximation method and then manifests the wave
packet collapse as well as the exactly-solvable case. By highlighting these
analysis, it is finally found that an essence of the dynamical model of wave
packet collapse is the factorization of the Schrodinger evolution other than
the exact solvability. So many dynamical models including the well-known ones
before, which are exactly-solvable or not, can be shown only to be the concrete
realizations of this factorizability
