On a_2^(1) Reflection Matrices and Affine Toda Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new non-diagonal solutions to the boundary Yang-Baxter-Equation
corresponding to a two-dimensional field theory with U_q(a_2^(1)) quantum
affine symmetry on a half-line. The requirements of boundary unitarity and
boundary crossing symmetry are then used to find overall scalar factors which
lead to consistent reflection matrices. Using the boundary bootstrap equations
we also compute the reflection factors for scalar bound states (breathers).
These breathers are expected to be identified with the fundamental quantum
particles in a_2^(1) affine Toda field theory and we therefore obtain a
conjecture for the affine Toda reflection factors. We compare these factors
with known classical results and discuss their duality properties and their
connections with particular boundary conditions.
