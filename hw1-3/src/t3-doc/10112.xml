<title>
Quantum Particle on a Quantum Circle
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a $q$-deformed dynamical system corresponding to the quantum free
particle moving along the circle. The algebra of observables is constructed and
discussed. We construct and classify irreducible representations of the system.
