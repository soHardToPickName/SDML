<title>
The boundary S-matrix and the AdS to CFT dictionary
</title>

<abstract>
  An S-matrix analog is defined for anti-de Sitter space by constructing ``in''
and ``out'' states that asymptote to the timelike boundary. A derivation
parallel to that of the LSZ formula shows that this ``boundary S-matrix'' is
given directly by correlation functions in the boundary conformal theory. This
provides a key entry in the AdS to CFT dictionary.
