<title>
The Principle of Equivalence as a Guide towards Matrix Theory
  Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  The principle of equivalence is translated into the language of the
world-volume field theories that define matrix and string theories. This idea
leads to explore possible matrix descriptions of M-theory compactifications. An
interesting case is the relationship between D=6 N=1 U(M) SYM and Matrix Theory
on K3.
