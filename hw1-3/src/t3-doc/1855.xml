Monopole Solutions in AdS Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We find monopole solutions for a spontaneously broken SU(2)-Higgs system
coupled to gravity in asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We present new
analytic and numerical results discussing,in particular, how the gravitational
instability of self-gravitating monopoles depends on the value of the
cosmological constant.
