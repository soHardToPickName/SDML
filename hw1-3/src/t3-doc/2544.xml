General Geometry and Geometry of Electromagnetism
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that Electromagnetism creates geometry different from Riemannian
one. General geometry containing Riemannian and geometry underlying
Electromagnetism as special cases is constructed. Action for electromagnetic
field and Maxwell equations are derived from curvature function of Geometry of
Electromagnetism.
