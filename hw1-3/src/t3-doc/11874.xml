<title>
Black Hole Graybody Factor and Black Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We have proposed the entropy formula of the black hole which is constructed
by the intersecting D1-brane and D5-brane with no momentum, whose
compactification radii are constrained by the surface gravities in
ten-dimensions. We interpret the entropy of the black hole as the statistical
entropy of the effective string living on the D5-brane. We further study the
behavior of the absorption cross-section of the black hole using our entropy
formula.
