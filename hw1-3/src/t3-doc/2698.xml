Correlation functions of the spin-1 analog of the XXZ model
</title>

<abstract>
  Exact integral representations of spin one-point functions (ground state
expectation values) are reported for the spin-1 analog of the XXZ model in the
region $-1<q<0$. The method enables one to calculate arbitrary $n$-point
functions in principle. We also report a construction of level 2 irreducible
highest weight representations of $U_q(\hat{sl}_2)$ in terms of boson and
fermion operators, and explicit forms of related vertex operators.
