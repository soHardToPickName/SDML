On Graceful Exit in String Cosmology with Pre-Big Bang Phase
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the problem of graceful exit from superinflationary pre-big bang
phase of string cosmology within the context of lowest-order string effective
action. The previous no go theorems are generalized for the case when higher
genus terms of general form and additional matter fields are included. It is
shown that the choice of the E-frame essentially simplifies the consideration.
For the example of pure gravi-dilaton case the comparison of E-frame and string
frame approaches, based on phase space analysis, is carried out.
