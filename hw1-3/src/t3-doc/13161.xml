On the dual-vector field condensation in the dual Monopole
  Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings
</title>

<abstract>
  The condensation of a dual-vector field is investigated in the dual Monopole
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with dual Dirac strings. The condensate of a
dual-vector field is calculated as a functional of a shape of a dual Dirac
string. The obtained result is compared with the gluon condensate calculated in
a QCD sum rules approach and on lattice.
