<title>
Microscopic entropy of the most general four-dimensional BPS black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent paper we have given the macroscopic and microscopic description
of the generating solution of toroidally compactified string theory BPS black
holes. In this note we compute its corresponding microscopic entropy. Since by
definition the generating solution is the most general solution modulo
U-duality transformations, this result allows for a description of the
fundamental degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of any regular BPS
black holes of toroidally compactified string (or M) theory.
