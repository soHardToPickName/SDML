Extended BRST quantization in general coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an extended BRST invariant Lagrangian quantization scheme of
general gauge theories based on explicit realization of "modified triplectic
algebra" in general coordinates. All the known Lagrangian quantization schemes
based on the extended BRST symmetry are obtained by specifying the (free)
parameters of that method.
