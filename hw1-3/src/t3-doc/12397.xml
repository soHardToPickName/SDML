Composite Skyrme Model with Vector Mesons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the composite Skyrme model, proposed by Cheung and G\"{u}rsey,
introducing vector mesons in a chiral Lagrangian. We calculate the static
properties of baryons and compare with results obtained from models without
vector mesons.
