Modifying N=2 Supersymmetry via Partial Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We study realization of N=2 SUSY in N=2 abelian gauge theory with electric
and magnetic $FI$ terms within a manifestly supersymmetric formulation. We find
that after dualization of even one $FI$ term N=2 SUSY is realized in a partial
breaking mode off shell. In the case of two $FI$ terms, this regime is
preserved on shell. The N=2 SUSY algebra is shown to be modified on
gauge-variant objects.
