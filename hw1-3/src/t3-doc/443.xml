<title>
Comment on the ``$\theta$-term renormalization in the (2+1)-dimensional
  $CP^{N-1}$ model with $\theta$ term''
</title>

<abstract>
  It is found that the recently published first coefficient of nonzero
$\beta$-function for the Chern-Simons term in the $1/N$ expansion of the
$CP^{N-1}$ model is untrue numerically. The correct result is given. The main
conclusions of Park's paper are not changed.
