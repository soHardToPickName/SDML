<title>
Integrals of motion, supersymmetric quantum mechanics and dynamical
  supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The class of relativistic spin particle models reveals the `quantization' of
parameters already at the classical level. The special parameter values emerge
if one requires the maximality of classical global continuous symmetries. The
same requirement applied to a non-relativistic particle with odd degrees of
freedom gives rise to supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Coupling classical
non-relativistic superparticle to a `U(1) gauge field', one can arrive at the
quantum dynamical supersymmetry. This consists in supersymmetry appearing at
special values of the coupling constant characterizing interaction of a system
of boson and fermion but disappearing in a free case. Possible relevance of
this phenomenon to high-temperature superconductivity is speculated.
