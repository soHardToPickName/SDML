<title>
String Representation of Wilson Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the consequences of imposing Polyakov's zig/zag-invariance in the
search for a confining string. We first find that the requirement of
zig/zag-invariance seems to be incompatible with spacetime supersymmetry. We
then try to find zig/zag-invariant string backgrounds on which to implement the
minimal-area prescription for the calculation of Wilson loops considering
different possibilities.
