Boundary States for AdS_2 Branes in AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct boundary states for the AdS_2 D-branes in AdS_3. We show that,
in the semi-classical limit, the boundary states correctly reproduce geometric
configurations of these branes. We use the boundary states to compute the one
loop free energy of open string stretched between the branes. The result agrees
precisely with the open string computation in hep-th/0106129.
