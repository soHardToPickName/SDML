Anomaly cancellation in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the complete cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies in the
M-theory of Horava and Witten using their boundary contribution, and a term
coming from the existence of two and five-branes. A factor of three discrepancy
noted in an earlier work is resolved. We end with a comment on flux
quantization.
