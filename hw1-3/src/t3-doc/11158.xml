<title>
On the physical interpretation of effective actions using Schwinger's
  formula
</title>

<abstract>
  We show explicitly that Schwinger's formula for one-loop effective actions
corresponds to the summation of energies associated with the zero-point
oscillations of the fields. We begin with a formal proof, and after that we
confirm it using a regularization prescription.
