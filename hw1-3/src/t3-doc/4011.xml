Massless Limits of Massive Tensor Fields II --- Infrared regularization
  of Fierz-Pauli model ---
</title>

<abstract>
  Izawa's gauge-fixing procedure based on BRS symmetry is applied twice to the
massive tensor field theory of Fierz-Pauli type. It is shown the second
application can remove massless singularities which remain after the first
application. Massless limit of the theory is discussed.
