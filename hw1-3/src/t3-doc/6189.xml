<title>
Testing M(atrix)-Theory at Two Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  I discuss the relation between M-theory and M(atrix)-theory in flat space by
considering the effective potential for the scattering of two groups of
D0-branes in both theories. An explicit calculation of this potential up to two
loop order in M(atrix)-theory reveals a fascinating agreement. Lecture given at
Strings '97; June 17, 1997.
