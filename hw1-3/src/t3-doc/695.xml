Coordinate and K\"{a}hler $\sigma$-Model Anomalies and Their
  Cancellation in String Effective Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the complete set of one-loop triangle graphs involving the
Yang-Mills gauge connection, the \Kahler\ connection and the $\sigma$-model
coordinate connection in the effective field theory of $(2,2)$ symmetric $Z_N$
orbifolds. That is, we discuss pure gauge, pure \Kahler\ and pure
$\sigma$-model coordinate anomalies as well as the mixed anomalies, such as
\Kahler-gauge, some of which have been discussed elsewhere. We propose a
mechanism for restoring both \Kahler\ and $\sigma$-model coordinate symmetry
based upon the introduction of two types of counterterms. Finally, we enlarge
the $\sigma$-model generalization of the Green-Schwarz mechanism to allow the
removal of the universal parts of a wider class of anomalies than those
previously discussed.
