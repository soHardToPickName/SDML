Can the $2(2j+1)$ component Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equations describe
  the electromagnetic field?
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the massless $j=1$ Weinberg-Tucker-Hammer equations reduce
to the Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic field under the definite choice
of field functions and initial and boundary conditions. Thus, the former appear
to be of use in a description of some physical processes for which that could
be necessitated or be convenient. The possible consequences are discussed.
