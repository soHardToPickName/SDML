T-Duality and Non-Local Realizations of Supersymmetry in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study non-local realizations of extended worldsheet supersymmetries and
the associated space-time supersymmetries which arise under a T-duality
transformation. These non-local effects appear when the supersymmetries do not
commute with the isometry with respect to which T-duality is performed.
