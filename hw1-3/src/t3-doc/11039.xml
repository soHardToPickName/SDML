<title>
Anyons and Chiral Solitons on a Line
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that excitations in a recently proposed gauge theory for anyons on a
line in fact do not obey anomalous statistics. On the other hand, the theory
supports novel chiral solitons. Also we construct a field-theoretic description
of lineal anyons, but gauge fields play no role.
