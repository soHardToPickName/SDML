Monopoles and Solitons in Fuzzy Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Monopoles and solitons have important topological aspects like quantized
fluxes, winding numbers and curved target spaces. Naive discretizations which
substitute a lattice of points for the underlying manifolds are incapable of
retaining these features in a precise way. We study these problems of discrete
physics and matrix models and discuss mathematically coherent discretizations
of monopoles and solitons using fuzzy physics and noncommutative geometry. A
fuzzy sigma-model action for the two-sphere fulfilling a fuzzy Belavin-Polyakov
bound is also put forth.
