A New Mechanism for Trapping of Photon
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new mechanism for trapping bulk gauge field, giving rise to a
massless photon on a flat Minkowski 3-brane in the Randall-Sundrum model in
five space-time dimensions. The mechanism we propose employs the topological
Higgs mechansim where a topological term and a 3-form gauge potential play an
important role. This new mechanism might be considered as a gauge field's
analog of the localization of bulk fermions with the mass term of a 'kink'
profile.
