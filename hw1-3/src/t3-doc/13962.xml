<title>
Non-Abelian Kubo Formula and the Multiple Time-Scale Method
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-Abelian Kubo formula is derived from the kinetic theory. That
expression is compared with the one obtained using the eikonal for a
Chern-Simons theory. The multiple time-scale method is used to solve the
non-Abelian Kubo formula, and the damping rate for longitudinal color waves is
computed.
