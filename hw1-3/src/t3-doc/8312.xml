<title>
Exotic Non-Supersymmetric Gauge Dynamics from Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend Seiberg's qualitative picture of the behavior of supersymmetric QCD
to nonsupersymmetric models by adding soft supersymmetry breaking terms. In
this way, we recover the standard vacuum of QCD with $N_f$ flavors and $N_c$
colors when $N_f < N_c$. However, for $N_f \geq N_c$, we find new exotic
states---new vacua with spontaneously broken baryon number for $N_f = N_c$, and
a vacuum state with unbroken chiral symmetry for $N_f > N_c$. These exotic
vacua contain massless composite fermions and, in some cases, dynamically
generated gauge bosons. In particular Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality seems
to persist also in the presence of (small) soft supersymmetry breaking. We
argue that certain, specially tailored, lattice simulations may be able to
detect the novel phenomena. Most of the exotic behavior does not survive the
decoupling limit of large SUSY breaking parameters.
