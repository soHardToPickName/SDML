<title>
Feynman Graphs from D-Particle Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that quantum propagation of D-particles in the limit \alpha'-> 0
can represent the "joining-splitting" processes of Feynman graphs of a certain
field theory in the light-cone frame. So basically it provides the possibility
to define a field theory by its Feynman graphs. The application of this
observation to define M-theory by an energetic expansion approach is discussed.
