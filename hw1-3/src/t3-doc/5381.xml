Quark-Antiquark Potential for Siegel Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the quark-antiquark potential employing the continuum action for
QCD-like random lattice strings proposed by Siegel. The model leads to a
potential similar to those obtained from Nambu-Goto string theory but has some
modifications which we interpret as velocity dependent contributions. We also
propose to add extra terms in the action which lead to physically interesting
propagators for partons for the infrared region.
