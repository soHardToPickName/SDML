Spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in N = 4 supergravity with matter.
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider the problem of spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking in $N=4$ supergravity interacting with vector multiplets. We
start with the ordinary version of such model with the scalar field
geometry $SU(1,1)/U(1)\otimes SO(6,m)/SO(6)\otimes SO(m)$. Then we
construct a dual version of this theory with the same scalar field
geometry, which corresponds to the interaction of arbitrary number of
vector multiplets with the hidden sector, admitting spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking without a cosmological term. We show that
supersymmetry breaking is still possible in the presence of matter
fields.
