<title>
Deformed Hyperk\"{a}hler Structure for K3 Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the method of algebraic deformation to N-tuple of algebraic K3
surfaces. When N=3, we show that the deformed triplet of algebraic K3 surfaces
exhibits a deformed hyperk\"{a}hler structure. The deformation moduli space of
this family of noncommutatively deformed K3 surfaces turns out to be of
dimension 57, which is three times of that of complex deformations of algebraic
K3 surfaces.
