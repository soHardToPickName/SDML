Lagrangean Approach to Hamiltonian Gauge Symmetries and the Dirac
  Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  Using well known Lagrangean techniques for uncovering the gauge symmetries of
a Lagrangean, we derive the transformation laws for the phase space variables
corresponding to local symmetries of the Hamilton equations of motion. These
transformation laws are shown to coincide with those derived by Hamiltonian
methods based on the Dirac conjecture. The connection between the Lagrangean
and Hamiltonian approach is illustrated for first class systems involving one
primary constraint.
