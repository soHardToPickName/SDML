<title>
Duality in the BTZ Black Hole and the Statistical Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  In Strominger's proposal for the computation of the statistical entropy of
black holes based on the asymptotic symmetry analysis of Brown and Henneaux a
fundamental role is played by the asymptotic conditions that the considered
metric must satisfy at infinity. Here it is shown that $T$-duality does not
preserve such conditions. This observation is used to discuss a possible
reformulation of the proposal.
