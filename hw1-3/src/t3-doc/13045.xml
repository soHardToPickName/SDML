The Standard Model and its Generalizations in Epstein-Glaser Approach to
  Renormalization Theory II: the Fermion Sector and the Axial Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We complete our study of non-Abelian gauge theories in the framework of
Epstein-Glaser approach to renormalization theory including in the model an
arbitrary number of Dirac Fermions. We consider the consistency of the model up
to the third order of the perturbation theory. In the second order we obtain
pure group theoretical relations expressing a representation property of the
numerical coefficients appearing in the left and right handed components of the
interaction Lagrangian. In the third order of the perturbation theory we obtain
the the condition of cancellation of the axial anomaly.
