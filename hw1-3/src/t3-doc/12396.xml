<title>
Classification of Conformality Models Based on Nonabelian Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  A systematic analysis is presented of compactifications of the IIB
superstring on $AdS_5 \times S^5/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a non-abelian
discrete group. Every possible $\Gamma$ with order $g \leq 31$ is considered.
There exist 45 such groups but a majority cannot yield chiral fermions due to a
certain theorem that is proved. The lowest order to embrace the nonSUSY
standard $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ model with three chiral families is
$\Gamma = D_4 \times Z_3$, with $g=24$; this is the only successful model found
in the search. The consequent uniqueness of the successful model arises
primarily from the scalar sector, prescribed by the construction, being
sufficient to allow the correct symmetry breakdown.
