Boundary States and Symplectic Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the set of boundary states in the symplectic fermion
description of the logarithmic conformal field theory with central charge c=-2.
We show that the thus constructed states correspond exactly to those derived
under the restrictions of the maximal chiral symmetry algebra for this model,
W(2,3,3,3). This connects our previous work to the coherent state approach of
Kawai and Wheater.
