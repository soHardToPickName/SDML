<title>
Soliton Solutions in Noncritical String Field Theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  We look for soliton solutions in $c=0$ noncritical string field theory
constructed by the authors and collaborators. It is shown that the string field
action itself is very complicated in our formalism but it satisfies a very
simple equation. We derive an equation which a solution to the equation of
motion should satisfy. Using this equation, we conjecture the form of a soliton
solution which is responsible for the nonperturbative effects of order
$e^{-A/\kappa}$. (Talk given by N.I. at ``Inauguration Conference of APCTP'',
