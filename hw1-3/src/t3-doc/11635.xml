<title>
Lagrangian approach to a symplectic formalism for singular systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a Lagrangian approach for constructing a symplectic structure for
singular systems. It gives a simple and unified framework for understanding the
origin of the pathologies that appear in the Dirac-Bergmann formalism, and
offers a more general approach for a symplectic formalism, even when there is
no Hamiltonian in a canonical sense. We can thus overcome the usual limitations
of the canonical quantization, and perform an algebraically consistent
quantization for a more general set of Lagrangian systems.
