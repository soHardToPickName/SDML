Marginal Flows between Mirror Pairs of Landau-Ginzburg String Vacua:
  Thickening Moduli Space via c=0 Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A recently introduced method for constructing marginal singular flows between
distinct Landau--Ginzburg theories at fixed central charge is reviewed. The
flows are constructed in an enlarged moduli space obtained by adding theories
with zero central charge. This mechanism is used to construct flows between
mirror pairs of string vacua described by N$=$2 superconformal Landau--Ginzburg
fixed points. In contrast to previous methods this new construction of mirror
theories does not depend on particular symmetries of the original theory.
