Introduction to D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  D-branes are string theory solitons defined by boundary conditions on open
strings that end on them. They play an important role in the non-perturbative
dynamics of string theory and have found a wide range of applications. These
lectures give a basic introduction to D-branes and their dynamics.
