O(d,d,Z) Transformations as Automorphisms of the Operator Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We implement the O(d,d,Z) transformations of T-duality as automorphisms
of the operator algebras of Conformal Field Theories. This extends these
transformations to arbitrary field configurations in the deformation class.
