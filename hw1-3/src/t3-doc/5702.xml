Algebras with Operator and Campbell--Hausdorff Formula
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce some new classes of algebras and estabilish in these algebras
Campbell--Hausdorff like formula. We describe the application of these
constructions to the problem of the connectivity of the Feynman graphs
corresponding to the Green functions in Quantum Fields Theory.
