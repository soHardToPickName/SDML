<title>
The Algebra of Differential Operators on the Circle and $\Wkpq$
</title>

<abstract>
  Radul has recently introduced a map from the Lie algebra of differential
operators on the circle to $\W_n$. In this note we extend this map to $\Wkpq$,
a recently introduced one-parameter deformation of $\Wkp$---the second
hamiltonian structure of the KP hierarchy. We use this to give a short proof
that $\W_\infty$ is the symmetry algebra of additional symmetries of the KP
equation. (The replaced version clears up some minor points and corrects some
notational glitches. Get this one!)
