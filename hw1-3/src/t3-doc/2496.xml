<title>
The $\sigma$-Model and Non-commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In terms of non-commutative geometry, we show that the $\sigma$--model can be
built up by the gauge theory on discrete group $Z_2$. We introduce a constraint
in the gauge theory, which lead to the constraint imposed on linear $\sigma$
model to get nonlinear $\sigma$ model .
