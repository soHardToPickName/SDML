<title>
Solution of the quantum inverse problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a formula that expresses the local spin and field operators of
fundamental graded models in terms of the elements of the monodromy matrix.
This formula is a quantum analogue of the classical inverse scattering
transform. It applies to fundamental spin chains, such as the XYZ chain, and to
a number of important exactly solvable models of strongly correlated electrons,
such as the supersymmetric t-J model or the the EKS model.
