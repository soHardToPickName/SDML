<title>
Relaxation of the cosmological constant in a movable brane world
</title>

<abstract>
  We present numerical evidence that a domain wall in a background with varying
vacuum energy density acquires velocity in the direction of decreasing Hubble
parameter. This should lead to at least a partial relaxation of the
cosmological constant on the wall.
