<title>
D0-D4 system and QCD_{3+1}
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a $(3+1)$-dimensional QCD model using a dual supergravity
description with a non-extremal $D0$-$D4$ brane background. We calculate the
spectrum of glueball masses and Wilson loops in the background. The mass
spectrum is shown to coincide with one in non-extremal $D4$-brane systems, and
an area low of spatial Wilson loops is established. We show that there is a
region that Kaluza-Klein modes of the Euclidean time direction are decoupled
without decoupling glueball masses.
