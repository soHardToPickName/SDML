<title>
A dual description of decoherence in de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  Decoherence associated with super-Hubble modes in de Sitter space may have a
dual description, in which it is attributed to interaction of sub-Hubble modes
with an ``environment'' residing just inside the observer's horizon. We present
a version of such description, together with some consistency checks, which it
is shown to pass.
