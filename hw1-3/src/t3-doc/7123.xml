<title>
N=1 Dual String Pairs and their Massless Spectra
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct two chains of fourdimensional F-theory/heterotic dual string
pairs with N=1 supersymmetry. On the F-theory side as well as on the heterotic
side the geometry of the involved manifolds relies on del Pezzo surfaces. We
match the massless spectra by using, for one chain of models, an index formula
to count the heterotic bundle moduli and determine the dual F-theory spectra
from the Hodge numbers of the fourfolds $X^4$ and of the type IIB base spaces.
