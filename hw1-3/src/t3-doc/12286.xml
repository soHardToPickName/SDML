Virial coefficients from 2+1 dimensional QED effective actions at finite
  temperature and density
</title>

<abstract>
  From spinor and scalar 2+1 dimensional QED effective actions at finite
temperature and density in a constant magnetic field background, we calculate
the corresponding virial coefficients for particles in the lowest Landau level.
These coefficients depend on a parameter theta related to the time-component of
the gauge field, which plays an essential role for large gauge invariance. The
variation of the parameter theta might lead to an interpolation between
fermionic and bosonic virial coefficients, although these coefficients are
singular for theta=pi/2.
