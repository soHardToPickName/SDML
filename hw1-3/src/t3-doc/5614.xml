<title>
Magnetic susceptibility of the 2D Ising model on the finite lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  The generalization of the form factor representation of the 2D Ising model
correlation function to the case of the general disposition of correlating
spins on a cylinder is given. The magnetic susceptibility on the lattice where
one of the dimensions $N$ is finite is calculated in both the para- and
ferromagnetic regions of the Ising coupling parameter. The singularity
structure in the complex temperature plane and the thermodynamic limit
$N\to\infty$ are discussed.
