Quantum Groups, Correlation Functions and Infrared Divergences
</title>

<abstract>
  We show in two simple examples that for one-dimensional quantum chains with
quantum group symmetries, the correlation functions of local operators are, in
general, infrared divergent. If one considers, however, correlation functions
invariant under the quantum group, the divergences cancel out.
