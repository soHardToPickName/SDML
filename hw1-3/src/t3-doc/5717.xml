Inflation from D-\bar{D} brane annihilation
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that the initial conditions for inflation are met when D5 and
\bar{D}5 branes annihilate. This scenario uses Sen's conjecture that a
co-dimension two vortex forms on the worldvolume of the annihilated 5-brane
system. Analogous to a "Big Bang", when the five branes annihilate, a vortex
localized on a 3-brane forms and its false vacuum energy generates an
inflationy space-time. We also provide a natural mechanism for ending inflation
via the motion of the vortex in the bulk due to its extrinsic curvature. We
also suggest a consistent way to end inflation and localize matter on our
space-time.
