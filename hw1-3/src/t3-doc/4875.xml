Patterns in Open String Field Theory Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  In open string field theory the kinetic operator mixes matter and ghost
sectors, and thus the ghost structure of classical solutions is not universal.
Nevertheless, we have found from numerical analysis that certain ratios of
expectation values for states involving pure ghost excitations appear to be
universal. We give an analytic expression for these ratios and find good
evidence that they are common to all known solutions of open string field
theory, including the tachyon vacuum solution, lump solutions and string fields
representing marginal deformations. We also draw attention to a close
correspondence between the expectation values for the pure matter components in
the tachyon vacuum solution and those in the solution of a simpler equation for
a ghost number zero string field. Finally we observe that the action of L_0 on
the tachyon condensate gives a state that is approximately factorized into a
matter and a ghost part.
