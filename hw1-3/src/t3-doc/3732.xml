<title>
Dynamics of cosmic strings and springs; a covariant formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  A general family of charge-current carrying cosmic string models is
investigated. In the special case of circular configurations in arbitrary
axially symmetric gravitational and electromagnetic backgrounds the dynamics is
determined by simple point particle Hamiltonians. A certain "duality"
transformation relates our results to previous ones, obtained by Carter et.
al., for an infinitely long open stationary string in an arbitrary stationary
background.
