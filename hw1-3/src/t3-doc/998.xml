<title>
Twisted K-theory and K-theory of bundle gerbes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we introduce the notion of bundle gerbe K-theory and investigate
the relation to twisted K-theory. We provide some examples. Possible
applications of bundle gerbe K-theory to the classification of D-brane charges
in non-trivial backgrounds are discussed.
