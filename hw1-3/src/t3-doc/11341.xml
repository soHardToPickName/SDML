<title>
Hamiltonian structure and gauge symmetries of Poincare gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a review of the constrained dynamical structure of Poincare gauge
theory which concentrates on the basic canonical and gauge properties of the
theory, including the identification of constraints, gauge symmetries and
conservation laws. As an interesting example of the general approach we discuss
the teleparallel formulation of general relativity.
