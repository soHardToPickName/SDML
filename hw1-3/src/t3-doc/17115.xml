Complementarity of the Maldacena and Randall-Sundrum Pictures
</title>

<abstract>
  We revive an old result, that one-loop corrections to the graviton propagator
induce 1/r^3 corrections to the Newtonian gravitational potential, and compute
the coefficient due to closed loops of the U(N) {\cal N}=4 super-Yang-Mills
theory that arises in Maldacena's AdS/CFT correspondence. We find exact
agreement with the coefficient appearing in the Randall-Sundrum brane-world
proposal. This provides more evidence for the complementarity of the two
pictures.
