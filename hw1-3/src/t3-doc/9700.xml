<title>
Holomorphic Bundles and Many-Body Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that spin generalization of elliptic Calogero-Moser system, elliptic
extension of Gaudin model and their cousins can be treated as a degenerations
of Hitchin systems. Applications to the constructions of integrals of motion,
angle-action variables and quantum systems are discussed. Explicit formulas for
the Lax operator on the higher genus surfaces are obtained in the Shottky
parameterization. The constructions are motivated by the Conformal Field
Theory, and their quantum counterpart can be treated as a degeneration of the
critical level Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equations.
