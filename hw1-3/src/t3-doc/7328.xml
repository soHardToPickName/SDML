Translations between Quaternion and Complex Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  While in general there is no one-to-one correspondence between complex and
quaternion quantum mechanics (QQM), there exists at least one version of QQM in
which a {\em partial} set of {\em translations} may be made. We define these
translations and use the rules to obtain rapid quaternion counterparts (some of
which are new) of standard quantum mechanical results.
