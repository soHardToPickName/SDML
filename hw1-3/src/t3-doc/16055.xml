<title>
Tension as a Perturbative Parameter in Non--Linear String Equations in
  Curved Space--Time
</title>

<abstract>
  A perturbation theory with respect to tension parameter
$\gamma/\alpha^\prime$ for the non--linear equations of string, moving in
curved space--time is considered. Obtained are linearized motion equations for
the functions of the $n-$th degree of approximation ($n=0,1,2$)
