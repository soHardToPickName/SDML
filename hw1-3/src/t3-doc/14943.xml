Generalized Eulerian Coordinates for Relativistic Fluids: Hamiltonian
  Rest-Frame Instant Form, Relative Variables, Rotational Kinematics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the rest-frame instant form of a new formulation of relativistic
perfect fluids in terms of new generalized Eulerian configuration coordinates.
After the separation of the relativistic center of mass from the relative
variables on the Wigner hyper-planes, we define orientational and shape
variables for the fluid, viewed as a relativistic extended deformable body, by
introducing dynamical body frames. Finally we define Dixon's multipoles for the
fluid.
