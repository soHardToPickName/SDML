Light-Cone Quantization of Gauge Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Light-cone quantization of gauge field theory is considered. With a careful
treatment of the relevant degrees of freedom and where they must be
initialized, the results obtained in equal-time quantization are recovered, in
particular the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt form of the gauge field propagator. Some
aspects of the ``discretized'' light-cone quantization of gauge fields are
discussed.
