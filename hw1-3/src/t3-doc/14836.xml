<title>
Exact Computations in the Burgers Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We complete the program outlined in the paper of the author with A. Migdal
and sum up exactly all the fluctuations around the instanton solution of the
randomly large scale driven Burgers equation. We choose the force correlation
function $\kappa$ to be exactly quadratic function of the coordinate
difference. The resulting probability distribution satisfy the differential
equation proposed by Polyakov without an anomaly term. The result shows that
unless the anomaly term is indeed absent it must come from other possible
instanton solutions, and not from the fluctuations.
