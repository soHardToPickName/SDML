Component Actions from Curved Superspace: Normal Coordinates and
  Ectoplasm
</title>

<abstract>
  We give efficient superspace methods for deriving component actions for
supergravity coupled to matter. One method uses normal coordinates to
covariantly expand the superfield action, and can be applied straightforwardly
to any superspace. The other interprets the component lagrangian as a
differential form on a bosonic hypersurface in superspace, and gives a simple
derivation for pertinent cases such as chiral superspace.
