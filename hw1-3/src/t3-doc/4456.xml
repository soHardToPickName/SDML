Field-Dependent BRS Tranformations and Correct Prescription for
  1/(n.k)^p-Type Singularities in Axial Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  The axial-gauge boson propagator contains 1/(n.k)^p-type singularities. These
singularities have generally been treated by inventing prescriptions for them.
We propose an alternative procedere for treating these singularities in the
path-integral formalism using the known way of treating the 1/k^{2n}-type
singularities in Lorentz-type gauges. For this purpose we use a finite
field-dependent BRS transformation that inerpolates between the Lorentz and
axial-type gauges. We arrive at the \epsilon-dependent tree propagator in
axial-type gauges.
