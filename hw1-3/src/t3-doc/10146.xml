<title>
Construction of Free Energy of Calabi-Yau manifold embedded in
  $CP^{n-1}$ via Torus Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate correlation functions of topological sigma model (A-model) on
Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in $CP^{N-1}$ using torus action method. We also
obtain path-integral represention of free energy of the theory coupled to
gravity.
