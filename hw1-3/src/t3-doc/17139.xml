<title>
Stability and BPS branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We define the concept of Pi-stability, a generalization of mu-stability of
vector bundles, and argue that it characterizes N=1 supersymmetric brane
configurations and BPS states in very general string theory compactifications
with N=2 supersymmetry in four dimensions.
