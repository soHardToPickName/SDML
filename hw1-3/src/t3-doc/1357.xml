New Insight into the Relation between Torsion and Electromagnetism
</title>

<abstract>
  In several unified field theories the torsion trace is set equal to the
electromagnetic potential. Using fibre bundle techniques we show that this is
no leading principle but a formal consequence of another geometric relation
between space-time and electromagentism.
