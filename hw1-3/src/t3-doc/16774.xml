Vector Deformations of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory, Pinned Branes, and
  Arched Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a deformation of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory by a dimension-5 vector
operator. There is a simple nonlocal "dipole" field-theory that realizes this
deformation. We present evidence that this theory is realized in the setting of
"pinned-branes". The dipoles correspond to open strings that arch out of the
brane. We find the gravitational dual of the theory at large N. We also discuss
the generalization to the (2,0) theory.
