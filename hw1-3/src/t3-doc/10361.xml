<title>
A Multi-Grid Method for the Resolution of Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz
  Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a multi-grid algorithm in order to solve numerically the
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations. We specifically adapt the program to
compute the data of the conformal field theory reached in the ultraviolet
limit. Submitted to Computer Physics Communications
