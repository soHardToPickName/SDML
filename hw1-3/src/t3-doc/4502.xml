<title>
Perturbative and Non-Perturbative Quarks and Gluons
</title>

<abstract>
  BRST invariance supplies a sufficient condition for the observability of
fields. We show that there is a global obstruction to the observability of
quarks and gluons and argue that they will not become observables at finite
temperature. We give expressions for quarks and gluons that are, however, {\it
perturbatively\/} BRST invariant, and hence locally observable, up to
order~$g^2$ and~$g$ respectively.
