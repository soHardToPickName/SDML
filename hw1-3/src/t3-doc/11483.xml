Minimal Models of Integrable Lattice Theory and Truncated Functional
  Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the integrable XXZ model with the special open boundary
conditions. We perform Quantum Group reduction of this model in roots of unity
and use it for the definition Minimal Models of Interable lattice theory. It is
shown that after this Quantum Group reduction Sklyanin's transfer-matrices
satisfy the closed system of the truncated functional relations. We solve these
equations for the simplest case.
