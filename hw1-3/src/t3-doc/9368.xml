Generalized Conformal Quantum Mechanics of D0-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the generalized conformal quantum mechanics of the probe D0-brane in
the near horizon background of the bound state of source D0-branes. We
elaborate on the relationship of such model to the M theory in the light cone
frame.
