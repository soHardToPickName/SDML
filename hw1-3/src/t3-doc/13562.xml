D-branes in the WZW model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is stated in the literature that D-branes in the WZW-model associated with
the gluing condition J = - \bar{J} along the boundary correspond to branes
filling out the whole group volume. We show instead that the end-points of open
strings are rather bound to stay on `integer' conjugacy classes. In the case of
SU(2) level k WZW model we obtain k-1 two dimensional Euclidean D-branes and
two D particles sitting at the points e and -e.
