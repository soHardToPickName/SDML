Notes on AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the conjectured strong-weak coupling worldsheet duality between the
SL(2)/U(1) and Sine-Liouville conformal field theories to study some properties
of degenerate operators and to compute correlation functions in CFT on AdS_3.
The same quantities have been computed in the past by other means. The
agreement between the different approaches provides new evidence for the
duality. We also discuss the supersymmetric analog of this duality, the
correspondence between SCFT on the cigar and N=2 Liouville. We show that in the
spacetime CFT dual to string theory on AdS_3 via the AdS/CFT correspondence,
the central term in the Virasoro algebra takes different values in different
sectors of the theory. In a companion paper we use the results described here
to study D-branes in AdS_3.
