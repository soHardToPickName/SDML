<title>
Monopole Condensates in Seiberg-Witten Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A product of two Riemann surfaces of genuses p_1 and p_2 solves the
Seiberg-Witten monopole equations for a constant Weyl spinor that represents a
monopole condensate. Self-dual electromagnetic fields require p_1=p_2=p and
provide a solution of the euclidean Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac equations with p-1
magnetic vortices in one surface and the same number of electric vortices in
the other. The monopole condensate plays the role of cosmological constant. The
virtual dimension of the moduli space is zero, showing that for given p_1 and
p_2, the solutions are unique.
