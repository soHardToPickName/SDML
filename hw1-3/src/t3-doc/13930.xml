Calabi-Yau Spaces and Five Dimensional Field Theories with Exceptional
  Gauge Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  Five dimensional field theories with exceptional gauge groups are engineered
from degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds. The structure of the Coulomb
branch is analyzed in terms of relative K\"ahler cones. For low number of
flavors, the geometric construction leads to new five dimensional fixed points.
