Renormalizations in softly broken N=1 theories: Slavnov-Taylor
  identities
</title>

<abstract>
  Slavnov-Taylor identities have been applied to perform explicitly the
renormalization procedure for the softly broken N=1 SYM. The result is in
accordance with the previous results obtained at the level of supergraph
technique.
