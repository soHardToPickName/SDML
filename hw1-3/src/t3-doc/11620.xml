<title>
Generalized statistics and the algebra of observables
</title>

<abstract>
  A short review is given of how to apply the algebraic Heisenberg quantization
scheme to a system of identical particles. For two particles in one dimension
the approach leads to a generalization of the Bose and Fermi description which
can be expressed in the form of a 1/x^2 statistics interaction between the
particles. For an N-particle system it is shown how a particular
infinite-dimensional algebra arises as a generalization of the su(1,1) algebra
which is present for the two-particle system.
