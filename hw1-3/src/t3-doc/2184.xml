Why Don't We Have a Covariant Superstring Field Theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  This talk deals with the old problem of formulatingn a covariant quantum
theory of superstrings, ``covariant'' here meaning having manifest Lorentz
symmetry and supersymmetry. The advantages and disadvantages of several
quantization methods are reviewed. Special emphasis is put on the approaches
using twistorial variables, and the algebraic structures of these. Some
unsolved problems are identified.
