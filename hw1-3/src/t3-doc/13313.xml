Quantum Hair, Instantons, and Black Hole Thermodynamics: Some New
  Results
</title>

<abstract>
  We present results obtained by a consideration of the non-classical energy
momentum tensor associated with Euclidean Instantons outside the event horizon
of black holes. We demonstrate here how this allows an analytic estimate to be
made of the effect of discrete quantum hair on the temperature of the black
hole, in which the role of violations of the weak energy condition associated
with instantons is made explicit, and in which the previous results of Coleman,
Preskill, and Wilczek are extended. Last, we demonstrate how the existence of a
non-classical electric field outside the event horizon of black holes,
uncovered by these authors, can be identified with a well-known effect in the
Abelian-Higgs model in two dimensions. In this case, there is a one-to-one
connection between the discrete charge of a black hole and a topological phase
in two dimensions.
