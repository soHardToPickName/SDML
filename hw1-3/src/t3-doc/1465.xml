<title>
Supergravities in diverse dimensions and their central extension
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture moduli dependent charges for p-extended objects are analyzed
for generic N-extended supergravities in dimensions 4 \leq D <10. Differential
relations and sum rules among the charges are derived.
