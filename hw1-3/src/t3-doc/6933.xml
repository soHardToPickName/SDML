Resonance NLS Solitons as Black Holes in Madelung Fluid
</title>

<abstract>
  A new resonance version of NLS equation is found and embedded to the
reaction-diffusion system, equivalent to the anti-de Sitter valued Heisenberg
model, realizing a particular gauge fixing condition of the Jackiw-Teitelboim
gravity. The space-time points where dispersion change the sign correspond to
the event horizon, and the soliton solutions to the AdS black holes. The
soliton with velocity bounded above describes evolution on the hyperboloid with
nontrivial winding number and create under collisions the resonance states with
a specific life time.
