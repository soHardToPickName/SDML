Black holes in the brane world:Time symmetric initial data
</title>

<abstract>
  We numerically construct time-symmetric initial data sets of a black hole in
the Randall-Sundrum brane world model, assuming that the black hole is
spherical on the brane. We find that the apparent horizon is cigar-shaped in
the 5D spacetime.
