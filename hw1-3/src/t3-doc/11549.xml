Hamiltonian Approach to $2D$ Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $2D$ supergravity in a covariant and gauge independent way. The
theory is obtained from $2D$ bosonic gravity following the square root method
and the diffeomorphism superalgebra is explicitly computed. We argue that our
approach could be a procedure for introducing nontrivial physics in quantum
$2D$ (super)gravity.
