<title>
Conformal Field Theory in Conformal Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a new framework for a Lagrangian description of conformal field
theories in various dimensions based on a local version of d+2-dimensional
conformal space. The results include a true gauge theory of conformal gravity
in d=(1,3) and any standard matter coupled to it. An important feature is the
automatic derivation of the conformal gravity constraints, which are necessary
for the analysis of the matter systems.
