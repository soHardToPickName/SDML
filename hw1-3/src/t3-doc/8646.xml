<title>
Chiral symmetry breaking, the superspace gap equation and the
  no-renormalization theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  Solutions of the superspace Schwinger-Dyson equations, describing mass
generation and chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric gauge theory, need
not be constrained to vanish by no-renormalization theorems, nor by special
choices of gauge parameter. Thus symmetry breaking vacuum structures remain
possible (as in non-supersymmetric gauge theory), inviting comparison with
predictions of an alternative approach based on holomorphy and the Wilsonian
effective action.
