Brane collisions and braneworld cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, we proposed a new braneworld model [GIT] in which the collision of
a brane universe and a vacuum bubble coming from the extra-dimension is
utilized as a trigger of brane big-bang. In this article, mainly reviewing this
model, we briefly summarize cosmological braneworld scenarios in which
collision of branes plays an important role.
