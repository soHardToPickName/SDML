EXTENDED SUPERCONFORMAL SYMMETRY, FREUDENTHAL TRIPLE SYSTEMS AND GAUGED
  WZW MODELS
</title>

<abstract>
We review the construction of extended ( N=2 and N=4 ) superconformal algebras
over triple systems and the gauged WZW models invariant under them. The N=2
superconformal algebras (SCA) realized over Freudenthal triple systems (FTS)
admit extension to ``maximal'' N=4 SCA's with SU(2)XSU(2)XU(1) symmetry. A
detailed study of the construction and classification of N=2 and N=4 SCA's over
Freudenthal triple systems is given. We conclude with a study and
classification of gauged WZW models with N=4 superconformal symmetry.
