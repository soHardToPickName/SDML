Parity Violating Bosonic Loops at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The finite temperature parity-violating contributions to the polarization
tensor are computed at one loop in a system without fermions. The system
studied is a Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs system in the broken phase, for which
the parity-violating terms are well known at zero temperature. At nonzero
temperature the static and long-wavelength limits of the parity violating terms
have very different structure, and involve non-analytic log terms depending on
the various mass scales. At high temperature the boson loop contribution to the
Chern-Simons term goes like T in the static limit and like T log T in the
long-wavelength limit, in contrast to the fermion loop contribution which
behaves like 1/T in the static limit and like log T/T in the long wavelength
limit.
