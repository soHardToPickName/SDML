<title>
Anomalies, Unitarity and Quantum Irreversibility
</title>

<abstract>
  The trace anomaly in external gravity is the sum of three terms at
criticality: the square of the Weyl tensor, the Euler density and Box R, with
coefficients, properly normalized, called c, a and a', the latter being
ambiguously defined by an additive constant. Considerations about unitarity and
positivity properties of the induced actions allow us to show that the total RG
flows of a and a' are equal and therefore the a'-ambiguity can be consistently
removed through the identification a'=a. The picture that emerges clarifies
several long-standing issues. The interplay between unitarity and
renormalization implies that the flux of the renormalization group is
irreversible. A monotonically decreasing a-function interpolating between the
appropriate values is naturally provided by a'. The total a-flow is expressed
non-perturbatively as the invariant (i.e. scheme-independent) area of the graph
of the beta function between the fixed points. We test this prediction to the
fourth loop order in perturbation theory, in QCD with Nf ~< 11/2 Nc and in
supersymmetric QCD. There is agreement also in the absence of an interacting
fixed point (QED and phi^4-theory). Arguments for the positivity of a are also
discussed.
