<title>
Multi-Instanton Calculus and Equivariant Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a systematic derivation of multi-instanton amplitudes in terms of
ADHM equivariant cohomology. The results rely on a supersymmetric formulation
of the localization formula for equivariant forms. We examine the cases of N=4
and N=2 gauge theories with adjoint and fundamental matter.
