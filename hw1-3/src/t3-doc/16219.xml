Scattering of Noncommutative Solitons in 2+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Interactions of noncommutative solitons in a modified U(n) sigma model in 2+1
dimensions can be analyzed exactly. Using an extension of the dressing method,
we construct explicit time-dependent solutions of its noncommutative field
equation by iteratively solving linear equations. The approach is illustrated
by presenting bound states and right-angle scattering configurations for two
noncommutative solitons.
