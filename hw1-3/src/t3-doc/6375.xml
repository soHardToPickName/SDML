Renormalization group for the internal space
</title>

<abstract>
  The renormalization group method is a successive integration over the
fluctuations which are ordered according to their length scale, a parameter in
the external space. A different procedure is described, where the fluctuations
are treated in a successive manner, as well, but their order is given by an
internal space parameter, their amplitude. The differential version of the
renormalization group equation is given which is the functional generalization
of the Callan-Symanzik equation in one special case and resums the loop
expansion in another one.
