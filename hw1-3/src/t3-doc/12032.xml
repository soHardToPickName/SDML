<title>
Symplectic Symmetry of the Neutrino Mass For Many Neutrino Flavors
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebraic structure of the neutrino mass Hamiltonian is presented for two
neutrino flavors considering both Dirac and Majorana mass terms. It is shown
that the algebra is Sp(8) and also discussed how the algebraic structure
generalizes for the case of more than two neutrino flavors.
