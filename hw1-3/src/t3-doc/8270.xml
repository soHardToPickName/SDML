Quantum Dilaton Gravity in the Light-cone Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, models of two-dimensional dilaton gravity have been shown to admit
classical black-hole solutions that exhibit Hawking radiation at the
semi-classical level. These classical and semi-classical analyses have been
performed in conformal gauge. We show in this paper that a similar analysis in
the light--cone gauge leads to the same results. Moreover, quantization of
matter fields in light--cone gauge can be naturally extended to include
quantizing the metric field {\it \`a la} KPZ. We argue that this may provide a
new framework to address many issues associated to black-hole physics.
