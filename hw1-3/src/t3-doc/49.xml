The confining branch of QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, as a consequence of a physical interpretation based on the
Abelian projection and on the QCD string, four-dimensional QCD confines the
electric flux if and only if the functional integral in the fiberwise-dual
variables admits a hyper-Kahler reduction under the action of the gauge group.
