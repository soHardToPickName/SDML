Black Hole Solutions in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two-parameter solutions of the low-energy four-dimensional
heterotic string which in the extremal limit reduce to supersymmetric monopole,
string and domain wall solutions. The effective scalar coupling to the Maxwell
field, $e^{-\alpha \phi} F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$, gives rise to a new string
black hole with $\alpha = \sqrt{3}$, in contrast to the pure dilaton black hole
solution which has $\alpha=1$. Implications of string/fivebrane duality in
$D=10$ to four-dimensional dualities are discussed.
