A note on R-currents and trace anomalies in the (2,0) tensor multiplet
  in d=6 and AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the two- and three-point functions of the SO(5) R-current of the
(2,0) tensor multiplet in d=6, using AdS/CFT correspondence as well as a free
field realization. The results obtained via AdS/CFT correspondence coincide
with the ones from a free field calculation up to an overall 4N^3 factor. This
is the same factor found recently in studies of the two- and three-point
functions of the energy momentum tensor in the (2,0) theory. We also connect
our results to the trace anomaly in d=6 in the presence of external vector
fields and briefly discuss their implications.
