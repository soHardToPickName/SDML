Quantum groups, q-dynamics and Rajaji
</title>

<abstract>
  We sketch briefly the essentials of the quantum groups and their application
to the dynamics of a q-deformed simple harmonic oscillator moving on a quantum
line, defined in the q-deformed cotangent (momentum phase) space. In this
endeavour, the quantum group $GL_{qp} (2)$- and the conventional rotational
invariances are respected together. During the course of this discussion, we
touch upon Rajaji's personality as a critical physicist and a bold and
adventurous man of mathematical physics.
