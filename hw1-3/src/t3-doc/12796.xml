<title>
Stress Energy Tensor in c=0 Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the partners of the stress energy tensor and their structure in
Logarithmic conformal field theories. In particular we draw attention to the
fundamental differences between theories with zero and non-zero central charge.
We analyze the OPE for T, \bar{T} and the logarithmic partners t and \bar{t}
for c=0 theories.
