<title>
Ideal quantum gases in two dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Thermodynamic properties of non-relativistic bosons and fermions in two
spatial dimensions and without interactions are derived. All the virial
coefficients are the same except for the second, for which the signs are
opposite. This results in the same specific heat for the two gases. Existing
equations of state for the free anyon gas are also discussed and shown to break
down at low temperatures or high densities.
