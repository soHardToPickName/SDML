Field theory of anyons in the lowest Landau level
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a field theory for anyons in the lowest Landau level starting
from the $N$-particle description, and discuss the connection to the full field
theory of anyons defined using a statistical gauge potential. The theory is
transformed to free form, with the fields defined on the circle and satisfying
modified commutation relations. The Fock space of the anyons is discussed, and
the theory is related to that of edge excitations of an anyon droplet in a
harmonic oscillator well.
