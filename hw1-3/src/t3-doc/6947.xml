<title>
W-algebras arising as chiral algebras of conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that chiral algebras of conformal field theory possess a
W-algebra structure. A survey of explicitly known W-algebras and their
constructions is given. (Talk given at the XIX International Colloquium on
``Group Theoretical Methods in Physics'', Salamanca, Spain, June 29 -- July 4,
1992)
