Discrete Torsion, Covering Groups and Quiver Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  Without recourse to the sophisticated machinery of twisted group algebras,
projective character tables and explicit values of 2-cocycles, we here present
a simple algorithm to study the gauge theory data of D-brane probes on a
generic orbifold G with discrete torsion turned on. We show in particular that
the gauge theory can be obtained with the knowledge of no more than the
ordinary character tables of G and its covering group G*. Subsequently we
present the quiver diagrams of certain illustrative examples of SU(3)-orbifolds
which have non-trivial Schur Multipliers. The paper serves as a companion to
our earlier work (arXiv:hep-th/0010023) and aims to initiate a systematic and
computationally convenient study of discrete torsion.
