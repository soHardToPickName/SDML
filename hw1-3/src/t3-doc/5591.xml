<title>
Gauging internal fermionic symmetries and spin 3/2 fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Field theoretic models possessing a global internal fermionic shift symmetry
are considered. When such a symmetry is realized locally, spin 3/2 fields
appear naturally as gauge fields. Implementation of the gauging procedure
requires not only the usual replacement of ordinary derivatives by covariant
derivatives containing the spin 3/2 fields, but also the inclusion of
additional monomials. The Higgs mechanism and the high energy Nambu-Goldstone
fermion equivalence theorem are explicitly demonstrated.
