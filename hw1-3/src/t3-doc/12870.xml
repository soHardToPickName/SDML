<title>
Trace extensions, determinant bundles, and gauge group cocycles
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the geometry of determinant line bundles associated to Dirac
operators on compact odd dimensional manifolds. Physically, these arise as
(local) vacuum line bundles in quantum gauge theory. We give a simplified
derivation of the commutator anomaly formula using a construction based on
noncyclic trace extensions and associated multiplicative renormalized
determinants.
