Multidimensional Isotropic and Anisotropic Q-Oscillator Models
</title>

<abstract>
  q-oscillator models are considered in two and higher dimensions and their
symmetries are explored. New symmetries are found for both isotropic and
anisotropic cases. Applications to the spectra of triatomic molecules and
superdeformed nuclei are discussed.
