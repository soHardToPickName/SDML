<title>
Lorentz Violation at One Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  The proof of one-loop renormalizability of the general Lorentz- and
CPT-violating extension of quantum electrodynamics is described. Application of
the renormalization-group method is discussed and implications for theory and
experiment are considered.
