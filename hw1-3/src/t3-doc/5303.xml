Massive fields in AdS(3) and compactification in AdS spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Massive arbitrary spin fields in AdS(3) spacetime are discussed in a
framework of light-cone gauge formulation. We also consider compactification of
AdS spacetime on manifold which is warped product of AdS space and sphere. Mass
spectra of massless and massive fields upon such compactification are found.
