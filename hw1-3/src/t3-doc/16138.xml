<title>
Integrability of the $C_{n}$ and $BC_{n}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the $C_{n}$ and $BC_{n}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider(RS) models with
interaction potential of trigonometric and rational types. The Lax pairs for
these models are constructed and the involutive Hamiltonians are also given.
Taking nonrelativistic limit, we also obtain the Lax pairs for the
corresponding Calogero-Moser systems.
