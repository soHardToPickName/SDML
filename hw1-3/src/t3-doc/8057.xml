Polarization Vectors, Doublet Structure and Wigner's Little Group in
  Planar Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish the equivalence of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca model to a
doublet of Maxwell-Chern-Simons models at the level of polarization vectors of
the basic fields using both Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms. The analysis
reveals a U(1) invariance of the polarization vectors in the momentum space.
Its implications are discussed. We also study the role of Wigner's little group
as a generator of gauge transformations in three space-time dimensions.
