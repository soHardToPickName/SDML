<title>
Chiral anomalies and Poincare invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  I study variations of the fermionic determinant for a nonabelian Dirac
fermion with external vector and axial vector sources. I consider different
regularizations, leading to different chiral anomalies when the variations are
chiral transformations. For these different regularizations, I then consider
variations associated with Poincare transformations. I find that both Lorentz
and translational invariance are anomalously violated in general, but that they
are respected when the variations of the determinant are regularized to give a
Wess-Zumino consistent anomaly (the Bardeen anomaly). If the variations are
regularized to give a covariant anomaly, then Poincare invariance is not
respected. Following Manohar in an investigation of Poincare anomalies in a
chiral gauge theory, this gives an alternative way to understand the need for a
consistent regularization of the variations of the fermionic determinant.
