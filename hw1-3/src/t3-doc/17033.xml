Null Branes in String Theory Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider null bosonic p-branes moving in curved space-times and develop a
method for solving their equations of motion and constraints, which is suitable
for string theory backgrounds. As an application, we give an exact solution for
such background in ten dimensions.
