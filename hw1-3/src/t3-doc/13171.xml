<title>
On gauge fixing in the Lagrangian formalism of superfield BRST
  quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a modification of the gauge-fixing procedure in the Lagrangian
method of superfield BRST quantization for general gauge theories which
simultaneously provides a natural generalization of the well-known BV
quantization scheme as far as gauge-fixing is concerned. A superfield form of
BRST symmetry for the vacuum functional is found. The gauge-independence of the
S-matrix is established.
