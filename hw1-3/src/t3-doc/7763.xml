Projections of Virasoro Singular Vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  We use recently derived explicit formulae for the Virasoro algebra's singular
vectors to give constructive proofs of three results due to Feigin and Fuchs.
The main result, which is needed for a rigorous treatment of fusion, describes
the action of the singular vectors on conformal fields.
