<title>
Universality and the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  The hypothesis that the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking is due
to interactions of massless fermions in their lowest Landau level is examined
in the context of chirally symmetric models with short ranged interactions. It
is argued that, when the magnetic field is sufficiently large, even an
infinitesimal attractive interaction in the appropriate channel will break
chiral symmetry.
