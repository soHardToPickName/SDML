<title>
Topological Electropoles in 4+1 Dimensional EYMCS Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A class of explicit exact solutions of Einstein Yang Mills Chern Simons
(EYMCS) theory corresponding to topological solitons carrying non-Abelian
topological electric charge is obtained. This verifies a conjecture made in
Ref.[1,2] regarding the stabilization of the corresponding charged
configurations in the theory without gravity .
