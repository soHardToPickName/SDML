<title>
Gauge Theory of Massive Tensor Field
</title>

<abstract>
  In order to construct a massive tensor theory with a smooth massless limit,
we apply the Batalin-Fradkin algorithm to the ordinary massive tensor theory.
By introducing an auxiliary vector field all second-class constraints are
converted into first-class ones. We find a gauge-fixing condition which
produces a massive tensor theory of desirable property.
