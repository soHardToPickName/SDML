<title>
Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism and Integration Theory on Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  The correspondence between the BV-formalism and integration theory on
supermanifolds is established. An explicit formula for the density on a
Lagrangian surface in a superspace provided with an odd symplectic structure
and a volume form is proposed.
