Effective equations of motion and initial conditions for inflation in
  quantum cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain effective equations of inflationary dynamics for the mean inflaton
and metric fields in the no-boundary and tunneling quantum states of the
Universe. In the slow roll approximation (taking the form of the local
Schwiger-DeWitt expansion) effective equations follow from the Euclidean
effective action on the DeSitter gravitational instanton. Effective equations
are applied in the model of the inflaton scalar field coupled to the GUT sector
of matter fields and also having a strong nonminimal coupling to the curvature.
The inverse of its big negative nonminimal coupling constant, serves as a small
parameter of the slow roll expansion and semiclassical expansion of quantum
gravitational effects. As a source of initial conditions we use a sharp
probability peak recently obtained in the one-loop approximation for the
no-boundary and tunneling quantum states and belonging (in virtue of a strong
nonminimal coupling) to the GUT energy scale much below the Planck scale. The
obtained equations in the tunneling quantum state predict a finite duration of
inflationary stage compatible with the observational status of inflation
theory, whereas for the no-boundary state they lead to the infinite
inflationary epoch with a constant inflaton field.
