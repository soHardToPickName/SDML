<title>
Variational Resummation of $\epsilon$-Expansions of Critical Exponents
  of Nonlinear O(N)-Symmetric $\sigma$-Model in $2+\epsilon$ Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a method for extracting accurate critical exponents from
perturbation expansions of the O(n)-symmetric nonlinear sigma-model in D=2+
epsilon dimensions. This is possible by considering the epsilon-expansions in
this model as strong-coupling expansions of functions of the variable
tildevarepsilon = 2(4-D)/(D-2), whose first five weak-coupling expansion
coefficients of powers of tildevarepsilon are known from varepsilon-expansions
of critical exponents in O(n)-symmetric phi^4-theory in D=4-epsilon dimensions.
