Comment on "Supersymmetry and Singular Potentials" by Das and Pernice

<abstract>
  Witten's supersymmetric quantum mechanics may incorporate potentials with
strong singularities after their appropriate regularization. This was proposed
by Das and Pernice [Nucl. Phys. B 561 (1999) 357 and arXiv: hep-th/0207112]. We
suggest that one of the most natural recipes of this type is generated by an
infinitesimal complex shift of coordinates. The necessary regularization is
then mediated by a non-Hermitian, PT symmetric intermediate Hamiltonian.
