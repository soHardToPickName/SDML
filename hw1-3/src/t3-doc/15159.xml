Derivation of Einstein Equation from a New Type of four Dimensional
  Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  A new type of superstring in four dimension is proposed which has the central
charge 26. The Neveu Schwarz and the Ramond vacua are both tachyonic. The self
energy of the scalar tachyon cancels from the contribution of the fermionic
loop of the Ramond sector. The NS tachyonic vacuum is used to construct a
massless graviton. Coulombic vector excitations of zero mass, referred as a
`Newtonian' graviton are also shown to exist. The propagators are explicitly
evaluated. Following the method of Weinberg, we deduce the Einstein's field
equation of general relativity.
