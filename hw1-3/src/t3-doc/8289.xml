<title>
On the Integrability of Covariant Field Theory for Open N=2 Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the integrability of the Berkovits-Siegel open string field
equations and derive an infinite set of their non-local (solution-generating)
symmetries. The string field equations are embedded in an infinite system of
overdetermined equations (BS hierarchy) associated with hidden string
symmetries. The latter enforce the vanishing of most scattering amplitudes for
the open N=2 string.
