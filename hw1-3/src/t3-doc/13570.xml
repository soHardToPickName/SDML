<title>
Abelian BF Theories and Knot Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, a new observable for the
Abelian BF theory is proposed whose vacuum expectation value is related to the
Alexander-Conway polynomial. The three-dimensional case is analyzed explicitly,
and it is proved to be anomaly free. Moreover, at the second order in
perturbation theory, a new formula for the second coefficient of the
Alexander-Conway polynomial is obtained. An account on the higher-dimensional
generalizations is also given.
