Evidence for String Substructure
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the behavior of string theory at high temperature and high
longitudinal boosts, combined with the emergence of p-branes as necessary
ingredients in various string dualities, point to a possible reformulation of
strings, as well as p-branes, as composites of bits. We review the string-bit
models, and suggest generalizations to incorporate p-branes.
