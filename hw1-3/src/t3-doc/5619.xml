<title>
Inflation and Holography in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The encoding of an inflating patch of space-time in terms of a dual theory is
discussed. Following Bousso's interpretation of the holographic principle, we
find that those are generically described not by states in the dual theory but
by density matrices. We try to implement this idea on simple deformations of
the AdS/CFT examples, and an argument is given as to why inflation is so
elusive to string theory.
