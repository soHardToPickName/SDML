<title>
Chiral Bosons as solutions of the BV master equation 2D chiral gauge
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the chiral Wess-Zumino term as a solution for the
Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation for anomalous two-dimensional gauge
theories, working in an extended field-antifield space, where the gauge group
elements are introduced as additional degrees of freedom.
  We analyze the Abelian and the non-Abelian cases, calculating in both cases
the BRST generator in order to show the physical equivalence between this
chiral solution for the master equation and the usual (non-chiral) one.
