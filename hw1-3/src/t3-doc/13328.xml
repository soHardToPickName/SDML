Massless Flavor in Geometry and Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The proper inclusion of flavor in the Dijkgraaf-Vafa proposal for the
solution of N=1 gauge theories through matrix models has been subject of debate
in the recent literature. We here reexamine this issue by geometrically
engineering fundamental matter with type IIB branes wrapped on non-compact
cycles in the resolved geometry, and following them through the geometric
transition. Our approach treats massive and massless flavor fields on equal
footing, including the mesons. We also study the geometric transitions and
superpotentials for finite mass of the adjoint field. All superpotentials we
compute reproduce the field theory results. Crucial insights come from T-dual
brane constructions in type IIA.
