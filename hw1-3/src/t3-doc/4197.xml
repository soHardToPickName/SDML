<title>
On Linearization of N=1 Nonlinear Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The N=1 Volkov-Akulov model of nonlinear supersymmetry is explicitly related
to a vector supermultiplet model with a Fayet-Iliopoulos D term of linear
supersymmetry. The physical significance of the results is discussed briefly.
