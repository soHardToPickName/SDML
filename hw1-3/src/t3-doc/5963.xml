Open Cosmic Strings in Black Hole Space-Times
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct open cosmic string solutions in Schwarzschild black hole and
non-dilatonic black p-brane backgrounds. These strings can be thought to
stretch between two D-branes or between a D-brane and the horizon in curved
space-time. We study small fluctuations around these solutions and discuss
their basic properties.
