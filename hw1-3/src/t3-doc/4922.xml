<title>
Supersymmetry and F-theory realization of the deformed conifold with
  three-form flux
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the deformed conifold solution with three-form flux, found
by Klebanov and Strassler, is supersymmetric, and that it admits a simple
F-theory description in terms of a direct product of the deformed conifold and
a torus. Some general remarks on Ramond-Ramond backgrounds and warped
compactifications are included.
