Introduction to Superstring Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lecture notes, an introduction to superstring theory is presented.
Classical strings, covariant and light-cone quantization, supersymmetric
strings, anomaly cancelation, compactification, T-duality, supersymmetry
breaking, and threshold corrections to low-energy couplings are discussed. A
brief introduction to non-perturbative duality symmetries is also included.
