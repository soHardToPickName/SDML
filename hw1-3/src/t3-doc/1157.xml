Non-abelian Tensor-multiplet Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the anomaly cancellation of the M-theory fivebrane to derive the
R-symmetry anomalies of the $A_{N}$ $(0,2)$ tensor-multiplet theories. This
result leads to a simple derivation of black hole entropy in $d=4, \CN=2$
compactifications of $M$-theory. We also show how the formalism of normal
bundle anomaly cancellation clarifies the Kaluza-Klein origin of Chern-Simons
terms in gauged supergravity theories. The results imply the existence of
interesting 1/N corrections in the AdS/CFT correspondence.
