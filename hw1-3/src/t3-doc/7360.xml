<title>
Phase Structure of Non-Commutative Field Theories and Spinning Brane
  Bound States
</title>

<abstract>
  General spinning brane bound states are constructed, along with their
near-horizon limits which are relevant as dual descriptions of non-commutative
field theories. For the spinning D-brane world volume theories with a B-field a
general analysis of the gauge coupling phase structure is given, exhibiting
various novel features, already at the level of zero angular momenta. We show
that the thermodynamics is equivalent to the commutative case at large N and we
discuss the possibility and consequences of finite N. As an application of the
general analysis, the range of validity of the thermodynamics for the NCSYM is
discussed. In view of the recently conjectured existence of a 7-dimensional
NCSYM, the thermodynamics of the spinning D6-brane theory, for which a stable
region can be found, is presented in detail. Corresponding results for the
spinning M5-M2 brane bound state, including the near-horizon limit and
thermodynamics, are given as well.
