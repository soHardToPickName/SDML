Lee-Yang edge singularity in the three-dimensional Gross-Neveu model at
  finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relevance of the Lee-Yang edge singularity to the
finite-temperature Z_2-symmetry restoration transition of the Gross-Neveu model
in three dimensions. We present an explicit result for its large-N free energy
density in terms of Zeta(3) and the absolute maximum of Clausen's function.
