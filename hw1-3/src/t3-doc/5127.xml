Duality, gauging and superHiggs effect in string and M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider no-scale extended supergravity models as they arise from string
and M-theory compactifications in presence of fluxes. The special role of
gauging axion symmetries for the Higgs and superHiggs mechanism is outlined.
