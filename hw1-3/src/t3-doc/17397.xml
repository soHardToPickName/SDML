<title>
Surface counterterms and boundary stress-energy tensors for
  asymptotically non-anti-de Sitter spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  For spaces which are not asymptotically anti-de Sitter where the asymptotic
behavior is deformed by replacing the cosmological constant by a dilaton scalar
potential, we show that it is possible to have well-defined boundary
stress-energy tensors and finite Euclidean actions by adding appropriate
surface counterterms. We illustrate the method by the examples of domain-wall
black holes in gauged supergravities, three-dimensional dilaton black holes and
topological dilaton black holes in four dimensions. We calculate the boundary
stress-energy tensor and Euclidean action of these black configurations and
discuss their thermodynamics. We find new features of topological black hole
thermodynamics.
