Are There Topological Black Hole Solitons in String Theory?
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that the celebrated Hawking effect of quantum instability of
black holes seems to be related to a nonperturbative effect in string theory.
Studying quantum dynamics of strings in the gravitational background of black
holes we find classical instability due to emission of massless string
excitations. The topology of a black hole seems to play a fundamental role in
developing the string theory classical instability due to the effect of sigma
model instantons. We argue that string theory allows for a qualitative
description of black holes with very small masses and it predicts topological
solitons with quantized spectrum of masses. These solitons would not decay into
string massless excitations but could be pair created and may annihilate also.
Semiclassical mass quantization of topological solitons in string theory is
based on the argument showing existence of nontrivial zeros of beta function of
the renormalization group.
