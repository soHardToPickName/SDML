<title>
Lagrangian formulation of irreducible massive fields of arbitrary spin
  in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Lagrangian formulation of free massive fields corresponding to irreducible
representations of the Poincare group of arbitrary integer and half-integer
spins in three-dimensional space-time is presented. A relationship of the
theory under consideration with the self-duality equations in four dimensions
is discussed.
