<title>
Gauge Independence of the Lagrangian Path Integral in a Higher-Order
  Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a Lagrangian path integral based on gauge symmetries generated by
a symmetric higher-order $\Delta$-operator, and demonstrate that this path
integral is independent of the chosen gauge-fixing function. No explicit change
of variables in the functional integral is required to show this.
