QKZ equation with |q|=1 and correlation functions of the XXZ model in
  the gapless regime
</title>

<abstract>
  An integral solution to the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$KZ) equation
with $|q|=1$ is presented. Upon specialization, it leads to a conjectural
formula for correlation functions of the XXZ model in the gapless regime. The
validity of this conjecture is verified in special cases, including the nearest
neighbor correlator with an arbitrary coupling constant, and general
correlators in the XXX and XY limits.
