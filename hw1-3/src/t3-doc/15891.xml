The exact formula for neutrino oscillations
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the exact formula for neutrino oscillations. By resorting to
recent results of Quantum Field Theory of fermion mixing, we work out the
Green's function formalism for mixed neutrinos. The usual quantum mechanical
Pontecorvo formula is recovered in the relativistic limit.
