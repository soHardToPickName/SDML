A Note on Multi-trace Deformations and AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the general formula, at a finite cutoff, for the change in the
boundary condition of a scalar field in AdS under a Multiple-trace deformation
of the dual CFT. Our analysis suggests that fluctuations around the classical
solution in AdS should not be constrained by boundary conditions.
