<title>
A note on the path integral for systems with primary and secondary
  second class constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the phase space path integral for a system with arbitrary
second class constraints (primary, secondary ...) can be rewritten as a
configuration space path integral of the exponent of the Lagrangian action with
some local measure.
