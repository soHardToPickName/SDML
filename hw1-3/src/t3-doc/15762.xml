<title>
Operator Algebra in Chern-Simons Theory on a Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Chern-Simons gauge theory on a torus with both nonrelativistic
and relativistic matter. It is shown that the Hamiltonian and two total momenta
commute among themselves only in the physical Hilbert space. We also discuss
relations among degenerate physical states, degenerate vacua, and the existence
of multicomponent Schrodinger wavefunctions.
