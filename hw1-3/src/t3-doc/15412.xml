T-duality of the Green-Schwarz superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We study T-duality in the Green-Schwarz formalism to all orders in superspace
coordinates. We find two analogs of Buscher rules for the supervielbein and
clarify their meaning from the superstring point of view. The transformation
rules for the dilaton, spin 1/2 fermions and Ramond-Ramond superfields are also
derived.
