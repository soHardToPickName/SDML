AdS Dynamics from Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the extent to which a local string theory dynamics in anti-de
Sitter space can be determined from its proposed Conformal Field Theory (CFT)
description. Free fields in the bulk are constructed from the CFT operators,
but difficulties are encountered when one attempts to incorporate interactions.
We also discuss general features of black hole dynamics as seen from the CFT
perspective. In particular, we argue that the singularity of AdS_3 black holes
is resolved in the CFT description.
