<title>
Penrose limit of a non-supersymmetric RG fixed point
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend the BMN duality between IIB superstring theory on a pp-wave
background and a sector of N=4 super Yang-Mills theory to the
non-supersymmetric and unstable background built by Romans as a
compactification on a U(1) bundle over CP2 with 3-form and 5-form field
strength fluxes. We obtain a stable theory with the fewest number of
supercharges (e.g. 16) allowed by this kind of solutions and make conjectures
on the dual gauge theory.
