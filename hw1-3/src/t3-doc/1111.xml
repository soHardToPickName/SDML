Discrete Torsion and Shift Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we make two observations related to discrete torsion. First, we
observe that an old obscure degree of freedom (momentum/translation shifts) in
(symmetric) string orbifolds is related to discrete torsion. We point out how
our previous derivation of discrete torsion from orbifold group actions on B
fields includes these momentum lattice shift phases, and discuss how they are
realized in terms of orbifold group actions on D-branes. Second, we describe
the M theory dual of IIA discrete torsion, a duality relation to our knowledge
not previously understood. We show that IIA discrete torsion is encoded in
analogues of the shift orbifolds above for the M theory C field.
