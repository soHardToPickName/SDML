Multivalued Fields on the Complex Plane and Braid Group Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study in this paper a theory of free anyons associated to free conformal
field theories defined on Riemann surfaces with a discrete and nonabelian group
of authomorphisms. The particles are exchanged according to a nonabelian
statistics, in which the $R-$matrix satisfy a multiparametric generalization of
the usual Yang$-$Baxter equations.
