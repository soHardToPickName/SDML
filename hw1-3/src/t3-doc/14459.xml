<title>
Non-abelian gauge theories as a consequence of perturbative quantum
  gauge invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  We show for the case of interacting massless vector bosons, how the structure
of Yang-Mills theories emerges automatically from a more fundamental concept,
namely perturbative quantum gauge invariance. It turns out that the coupling in
a non-abelian gauge theory is necessarily of Yang-Mills type plus divergence-
and coboundary couplings. The extension of the method to massive gauge theories
is briefly discussed.
