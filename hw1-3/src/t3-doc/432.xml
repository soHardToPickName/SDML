<title>
Numerical Computation of the Effective Potential and Renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a novel way to compute the one-loop ring-improved effective
potential numerically, which avoids the spurious appearence of complex
expressions and at the same time is free from the renormalization ambiguities
of the self-consistent approaches, based on the direct application of
Schwinger-Dyson type equations to the masses.
