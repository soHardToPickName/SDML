<title>
Renormalization of Wilson Operators in the Light-Cone Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We test the renormalization of Wilson operators and the Mandelstam-
Leibbrandt gauge in the case when the sides of the loop are parallel to the n,
n* vectors used in the M-L gauge. Graphs which in the Feynman gauge are free of
ultra-violet divergences, in the M-L gauge show double divergences and single
divergences with non-local Si and Ci functions. These non-local functions
cancel out when we add all graphs together and the constraints of gauge
invariance are satisfied. In Appendix C we briefly discuss the problems of the
M-L gauge for loops containing spacelike lines.
