Various Modified Solutions of the Randall-Sundrum Model with the
  Gauss-Bonnet Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  The Gauss-Bonnet interaction is the only consistent quadratic interaction
below the Planck scale in the Randall-Sundrum compactification. We study
various static and inflationary solutions including this Gauss-Bonnet
interaction.
