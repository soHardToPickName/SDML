<title>
Canonical approach to 2D WZNW model, non-abelian bosonization and
  anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  The gauged WZNW model has been derived as an effective action, whose Poisson
bracket algebra of the constraints is isomorphic to the commutator algebra of
operators in quantized fermionic theory. As a consequence, the hamiltonian as
well as usual lagrangian non-abelian bosonization rules have been obtained, for
the chiral currents and for the chiral densities. The expression for the
anomaly has been obtained as a function of the Schwinger term, using canonical
methods.
