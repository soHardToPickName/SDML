The Role of Mass and External Field on the Fermionic Casimir Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of this work is to investigate the role played by the fermion mass
and that of an external field on the fermionic Casimir energy density under S^1
X R^3 topology. Both twisted and untwisted spin connections are considered and
the exact calculation is performed using a somewhat different approach based on
the combination of the analytic regularization method through
alpha-representation and Euler-Maclaurin summation formula.
