<title>
Structure of supergravity theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an elementary introduction to the structure of supergravity theories.
This leads to a table with an overview of supergravity and supersymmetry
theories in dimensions 4 to 11. The basic steps in constructing supergravity
theories are considered: determination of the underlying algebra, the
multiplets, the actions, and solutions. Finally, an overview is given of the
geometries that result from the scalars of supergravity theories.
