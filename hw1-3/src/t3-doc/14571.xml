<title>
W-Algebras from Soliton Equations and Heisenberg Subalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive sufficient conditions under which the ``second''
Hamiltonian structure of a class of generalized KdV-hierarchies defines one of
the classical $\cal W$-algebras obtained through Drinfel'd-Sokolov Hamiltonian
reduction. These integrable hierarchies are associated to the Heisenberg
subalgebras of an untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebra. When the principal
Heisenberg subalgebra is chosen, the well known connection between the
Hamiltonian structure of the generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies - the
Gel'fand-Dickey algebras - and the $\cal W$-algebras associated to the Casimir
invariants of a Lie algebra is recovered. After carefully discussing the
relations between the embeddings of $A_1=sl(2,{\Bbb C})$ into a simple Lie
algebra $g$ and the elements of the Heisenberg subalgebras of $g^{(1)}$, we
identify the class of $\cal W$-algebras that can be defined in this way. For
$A_n$, this class only includes those associated to the embeddings labelled by
partitions of the form $n+1= k(m) + q(1)$ and $n+1= k(m+1) + k(m) + q(1)$.
