Anomalous D-brane and orientifold couplings from the boundary state
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute scattering amplitudes involving both R-R and NS-NS fields in the
presence of a D-brane or orientifold plane. These provide direct evidence for
the anomalous couplings in the D-brane and orientifold actions. The D9-brane
and O9-plane are found to couple to the first Pontrjagin class with the
expected relative strength.
