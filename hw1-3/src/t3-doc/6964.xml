<title>
Dual formulation of classical W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  By extending the concept of \mc, I introduce a dual formulation of
(classical) nonlinear extensions of the \vir\ algebra. This dual formulation is
closely related to three dimensional actions which are analogous to a \cs\
action. I present an explicit construction in terms of superfields of the $N=2$
super \wfour.
