Induced Rigid String Action From Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  From the Dirac action on the world sheet, an effective action is obtained by
integrating over the 4-dimensional fermion fields pulled back to the world
sheet. This action consists of the Nambu-Goto area term with right dimensionful
constant in front, extrinsic curvature action and the topological Euler
characteristic term.
