<title>
A Simple Method for Computing Soliton Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  I provide an extremely simple argument that the kink-type solitons in certain
theories are fermionic. The argument is based on the Witten index, but can in
fact be used to determine soliton statistics in non-supersymmetric theories as
well.
