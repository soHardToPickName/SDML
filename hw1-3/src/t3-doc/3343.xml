Intersecting S-Brane Solutions of D=11 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct all possible orthogonally intersecting S-brane solutions in
11-dimensions corresponding to standard supersymmetric M-brane intersections.
It is found that the solutions can be obtained by multiplying the brane and the
transverse directions with appropriate powers of two hyperbolic functions of
time. This is the S-brane analog of the ``harmonic function rule''. The
transverse directions can be hyperbolic, flat or spherical. We also discuss
some properties of these solutions.
