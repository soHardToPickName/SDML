<title>
Algebraic Bethe ansatz approach for the one-dimensional Hubbard model
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate in terms of the quantum inverse scattering method the algebraic
Bethe ansatz solution of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. The method
developed is based on a new set of commutation relations which encodes a hidden
symmetry of 6-vertex type.
