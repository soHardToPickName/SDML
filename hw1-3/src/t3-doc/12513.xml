A quantum Peierls-Nabarro barrier
</title>

<abstract>
  Kink dynamics in spatially discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon systems is
considered. For special choices of the substrate potential, such systems
support continuous translation orbits of static kinks with no (classical)
Peierls-Nabarro barrier. It is shown that these kinks experience, nevertheless,
a lattice-periodic confining potential, due to purely quantum effects anaolgous
to the Casimir effect of quantum field theory. The resulting ``quantum
Peierls-Nabarro potential'' may be calculated in the weak coupling
approximation by a simple and computationally cheap numerical algorithm, which
is applied, for purposes of illustration, to a certain two-parameter family of
substrates.
