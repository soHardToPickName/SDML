Wess-Zumino Term in Tachyon Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the source of RR field computed from the boundary state
describing the decay of a non-BPS brane is reproduced by a particular form of
the Wess-Zumino term in the tachyon effective action. We also obtain a simple
expression of the S-charge associated with rolling tachyons.
