<title>
Generalized Squeezed States from Generalized Coherent States
</title>

<abstract>
  Both the coherent states and also the squeezed states of the harmonic
oscillator have long been understood from the three classical points of view:
the 1) displacement operator, 2) annihilation- (or ladder-) operator, and
minimum-uncertainty methods. For general systems, there is the same
understanding except for ladder-operator and displacement-operator squeezed
states. After reviewing the known concepts, I propose a method for obtaining
generalized minimum-uncertainty squeezed states, give examples, and relate it
to known concepts. I comment on the remaining concept, that of general
displacement-operator squeezed states.
