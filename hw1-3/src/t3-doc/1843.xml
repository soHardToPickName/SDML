Conservative Currents of Boundary Charges in $AdS_{2+1}$ Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The boundary charges which constitute the Virasoro algebra in 2+1 dimensional
anti-de Sitter gravity are derived by way of Noether theorem and diffeomorphic
invariance. It shows that the boundary charges under discussion recently
exhaust all the independent nontrivial charges available. Therefore, the state
counting via the Virasoro algebra is complete.
