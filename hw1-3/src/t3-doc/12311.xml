Logarithmic Operators in AdS_3/CFT_2
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation between singletons in AdS_3 and logarithmic operators
in the CFT on the boundary. In 2 dimensions there can be more logarithmic
operators apart from those which correspond to singletons in AdS, because
logarithmic operators can occur when the dimensions of primary fields differ by
an integer instead of being equal. These operators may be needed to account for
the greybody factor for gauge bosons in the bulk.
