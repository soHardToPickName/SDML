<title>
Configurations of two D-instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  The potential between two separated D-instantons at fixed (super) space-time
points is obtained by a simple explicit integration over the `massive'
variables of the zero-dimensional reduction of ten-dimensional U(2) super
Yang-Mills theory. This potential vanishes for asymptotically large
separations, becoming significant at separations of around the ten-dimensional
Planck scale with a singularity at the origin, which is resolved by the extra
`massless' internal Yang-Mills super-coordinates.
