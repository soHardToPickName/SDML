Matter Fields in Curved Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the geometry of a two-sheeted space-time within the framework of
non-commutative geometry. As a prelude to the Standard Model in curved
space-time, we present a model of a left- and a right- chiral field living on
the two sheeted-space time and construct the action functionals that describe
their interactions.
