<title>
Quantum evolution of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the near-horizon AdS_2\timesS^2 geometry of evaporating
near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes interacting with null matter. The
non-local (boundary) terms t_{\pm}, coming from the effective theory corrected
with the quantum Polyakov-Liouville action, are treated as dynamical variables.
We describe analytically the evaporation process which turns out to be
compatible with the third law of thermodynamics, i.e., an infinite amount of
time is required for the black hole to decay to extremality. Finally we comment
briefly on the implications of our results for the information loss problem.
