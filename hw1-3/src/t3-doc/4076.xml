<title>
Induced Parity-Breaking Term at Finite Chemical Potential and
  Temparature
</title>

<abstract>
  We exactly calculated the parity-odd term of the effective action induced by
the fermions in 2+1 dimensions at finite chemical potential and finite
temperature. It shows that gauge invariance is still respected. A more gerneral
class of background configurations is considered. The knowledge of the reduced
1+1 determinant is required in order to draw exact conclusions about the gauge
invariance of the parity-odd term in this latter case.
