Instantons of Type IIB Supergravity in Ten Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A family of SO(10) symmetric instanton solutions in Type IIB supergravity is
developed. The instanton of least action is a candidate for the low-energy,
semiclassical approximation to the {D=--1} brane. Unlike a previously published
solution,[GGP] this admits an interpretation as a tunneling amplitude between
perturbatively degenerate asymptotic states, but with action twice that found
previously. A number of associated issues are discussed such as the relation
between the magnetic and electric pictures, an inversion symmetry of the
dilaton and the metric, the $R\times S^9$ topology of the background, and some
properties of the solution in an "instanton frame" corresponding to a
Lagrangian in which the dilaton's kinetic energy vanishes.
