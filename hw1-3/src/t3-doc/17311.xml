<title>
Structure of Lorentzian algebras and Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The main properties of indefinite Kac-Moody and Borcherds algebras,
considered in a unified way as Lorentzian algebras, are reviewed. The
connection with the conformal field theory of the vertex operator construction
is discussed. By the folding procedure a class of subalgebras is obtained.
