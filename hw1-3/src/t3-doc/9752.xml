Holographic Normal Ordering and Multi-particle States in the AdS/CFT
  Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  The general correlator of composite operators of N=4 supersymmetric gauge
field theory is divergent. We introduce a means for renormalizing these
correlators by adding a boundary theory on the AdS space correcting for the
divergences. Such renormalizations are not equivalent to the standard normal
ordering of current algebras in two dimensions. The correlators contain contact
terms that contribute to the OPE; we relate them diagrammatically to
correlation functions of compound composite operators dual to multi-particle
states.
