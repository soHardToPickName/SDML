The M-Theory Two-Brane in AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the supermembrane action in an AdS_4 x S^7 and AdS_7 x S^4
background to all orders in anticommuting coordinates. The result is compared
to and agrees completely with results obtained earlier for generic supergravity
backgrounds through gauge completion at low orders in \theta.
