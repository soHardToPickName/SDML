Some Computations with Seiberg-Witten Invariant Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show, with a 2-dimensional example, that the low energy effective action
which describes the physics of a single D-brane is compatible with T-duality
whenever the corresponding U(N) non-abelian action is form-invariant under the
non-commutative Seiberg-Witten transformations.
