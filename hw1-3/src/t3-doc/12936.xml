<title>
Can the Fundamental Theory Of Everything be Renormalizable?
</title>

<abstract>
  Some considerations showing that renormalizable theories with consistent
perturbative theries can not be nonperturbatively finite (in terms of bare
parameters) are provided. Accordingly any fundamental unified theory has to be
either non renormalizable or order by order finite.
