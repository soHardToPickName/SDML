D-branes in Kazama-Suzuki Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate boundary states of D-branes wrapped around supersymmetric
cycles in Kazama--Suzuki models. We show that the geometry of the D-branes
corresponds to a generalisation of calibrated geometry. We comment on the link
with the geometry of the coset space and discuss how T-duality maps between
these boundary states.
