Hidden Symmetries in the 6-Vertex Model of Statistical Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  The transfer matrix of the 6-vertex model of two-dimensional statistical
physics commutes with many (more complicated) transfer matrices, but these
latter, generally, do not commute between each other. The studying of their
action in the eigenspaces of the 6-vertex model transfer matrix becomes
possible due to a ``multiplicative property'' of the {\em vacuum curves\/} of
$\cal L$-operators from which transfer matrices are built. This approach
allowed, in particular, to discover for the first time the fact that the
dimensions of abovementioned eigenspaces must be multiples of (big enough)
degrees of the number 2.
