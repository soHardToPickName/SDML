<title>
Field-enlarging transformations and chiral theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A field-enlarging transformation in the chiral electrodynamics is performed.
This introduces an additional gauge symmetry to the model that is unitary and
anomaly-free and allows for comparison of different models discussed in the
literature. The problem of superfluous degrees of freedom and their influence
on quantization is discussed. Several "mysteries" are explained from this point
of view.
