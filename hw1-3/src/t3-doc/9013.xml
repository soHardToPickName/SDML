<title>
Geometric (pre)quantization in the polysymplectic approach to field
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The prequantization map for a Poisson-Gerstenhaber algebra of dynamical
variables represented by differential forms within the polysymplectic
formulation of the De Donder--Weyl covariant Hamiltonian field theory is
presented and the corresponding prequantum Schroedinger equation for a
non-homogeneous form valued wave function is derived. This is the first step
toward understanding the procedures of covariant precanonical field
quantization from the point of view of geometric quantization.
