Anomalous Couplings in M-Theory and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore how various anomaly-cancelling terms in M-theory and string theory
transform non-trivially into each other under duality. Specifically, we study
the phenomenon in which bulk terms in M-theory get mapped to brane worldvolume
terms in string theory. The key mathematical ingredient is G-index theory.
