<title>
On the model of the relativistic particle with curvature and torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  Two integrals along the world trajectory of its curvature and torsion are
added to the standard action for the point-like spinless relativistic particle.
Since here the three-dimensional space-time is considered at the beginning, the
torsion of the world curve is defined with a sign in contrast to the previous
consideration: V. V. Nesterenko, J. Math. Phys. 32, 3315 (1991). Upon obtaining
a complete set of constraints in the phase space a generalized Hamiltonian
description of a new version of the model is constructed. This enables one to
quantize the model canonically and to derive exactly the relation between the
spin and mass of the states.
