Elliptic Genera and the Landau-Ginzburg Approach to N=2 Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the elliptic genera of orbifolds associated with $N=2$
super--conformal theories which admit a Landau-Ginzburg description. The
identification of the elliptic genera of the macroscopic Landau-Ginzburg
orbifolds with those of the corresponding microscopic $N=2$ orbifolds further
supports the conjectured identification of these theories. For $SU(N)$
Kazama-Suzuki models the orbifolds are associated with certain $\IZ_p$
subgroups of the various coset factors. Based on our approach we also
conjecture the existence of "$E$-type" variants of these theories, their
elliptic genera and the corresponding Landau-Ginzburg potentials.
