<title>
p-branes from (p-2)-branes in the Bosonic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Dirichlet p-brane can be expressed as a configuration of
infinitely many Dirichlet (p-2)-branes in the bosonic string theory. Using this
fact, we interpret the massless fields on the p-brane worldvolume as
deformations of the configuration of the (p-2)-branes. Especially we find that
the worldvolume gauge field parametrizes part of the group of diffeomorphisms
on the worldvolume.
