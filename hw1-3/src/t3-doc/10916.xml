Bulk effects in the cosmological dynamics of brane-world scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we deal with the cosmological dynamics of Randall-Sundrum
brane-world type scenarios in which the five-dimensional Weyl tensor has a
non-vanishing projection onto the three-brane where matter fields are confined.
Using dynamical systems techniques, we study how the state space of
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) and Bianchi type I cosmological
models is affected by the bulk Weyl tensor, focusing in the differences that
appear with respect to general relativity and also Randall-Sundrum cosmological
scenarios without the Weyl tensor contribution.
