Destructive Interference of Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  The soldering mechanism has been shown to represent the quantum interference
effect between self and anti-self dual aspects of a given symmetry. This
mechanism was used to show that the massive mode of the 2D Schwinger model
results from the constructive interference between the right and the left
massless modes of chiral Schwinger models. Similarly, the topologically massive
modes resulting from the bosonization of 3D massive Thirring models of opposite
mass signatures, are fused into the two massive modes of the 3D Proca model,
thanks to the interference of dualities characteristic of the soldering
mechanism. In this work, we show that the field theoretical analog of
destructive quantum mechanical interference may also be represented by the
soldering mechanism. This phenomenon is illustrated by the fusion of two
(diffeomorphism) invariant self-dual scalars described by right and left
chiral-WZW actions, producing a Hull non-mover field. After fusion, right and
left moving modes disappear from the spectrum, displaying the claimed
(destructive) interference of dualities.
