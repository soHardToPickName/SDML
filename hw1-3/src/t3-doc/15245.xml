Hopf instantons and the Liouville equation in target space
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalise recent results on Hopf instantons in a Chern--Simons and
Fermion theory in a fixed background magnetic field. We find that these
instanton solutions have to obey the Liouville equation in target space. As a
consequence, these solutions are given by a class of Hopf maps that consist of
the composition of the standard Hopf map with an arbitrary rational map.
