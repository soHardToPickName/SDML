Introduction to the Thermodynamics of Spin Chains
</title>

<abstract>
  We review how to obtain the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) equations for
the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ring in an external magnetic field. We review
how to solve these equations for low temperature and small field, and calculate
the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility.
