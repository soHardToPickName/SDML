Duality between coordinates and Dirac field
</title>

<abstract>
  The duality between the Cartesian coordinates on the Minkowski space-time and
the Dirac field is investigated. Two distinct possibilities to define this
duality are shown to exist. In both cases, the equations satisfied by
prepotentials are of second order.
