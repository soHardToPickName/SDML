Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics of Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  In the quantum mechanics of collision problems we must consider scattering
states of the system. For these states, the wave functions do not remain in
Hilbert space, but they are expressible in terms of generalized functions of a
Gel'fand triplet. Supersymmetric quantum mechanics for dealing with the
scattering states is here proposed.
