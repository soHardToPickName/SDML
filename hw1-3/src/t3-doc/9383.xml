<title>
New Tetrads for General Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the tools of q--differential calculus and quantum Lie algebras
associated to quantum groups, we find a one--parameter family of q-gauge
theories associated to the quantum group $ISO_q(3,1)$. Although the gauge
fields, that is the spin--connection and the vierbeins are non--commuting
objects depending on a deformation parameter, $q$, it is possible to construct
out of them a metric theory which is insensitive to the deformation. The
Christoffel symbols and the Riemann tensor are ordinary commuting objects.
Hence it is argued that torsionless Einstein's General Relativity is the common
invariant sector of a one--parameter family of deformed gauge theories.
