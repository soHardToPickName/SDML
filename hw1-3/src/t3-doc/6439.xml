<title>
Bosonic sector of D=11 superstring action and the critical dimension.
  Toy model
</title>

<abstract>
  Bosonic model inspired by D=11 superstring action is investigated. An
appropriate set of variables is find, in which the light-cone quantization
turns out to be possible. It is shown that anomaly terms in the algebra of the
light-cone Poincare generators are absent for the case D=27.
