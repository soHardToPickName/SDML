<title>
Principal Bundles, Connections and BRST Cohomology
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the elementary theory of gauge fields and the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-
Tyutin symmetry in the context of differential geometry. We emphasize the
topological nature of this symmetry and discuss a double Chevalley-Eilenberg
complex for it.
