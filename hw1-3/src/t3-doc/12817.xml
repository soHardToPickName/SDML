<title>
Zeta function determinant of the Laplace operator on the $D$-dimensional
  ball
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a direct approach for the calculation of functional determinants
of the Laplace operator on balls. Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions are
considered. Using this approach, formulas for any value of the dimension, $D$,
of the ball, can be obtained quite easily. Explicit results are presented here
for dimensions $D=2,3,4,5$ and $6$.
