Fusion and the Neveu-Schwarz Singular Vectors
</title>

<abstract>
  Bauer, Di Francesco, Itzykson and Zuber proposed recently an algorithm to
construct all singular vectors of the Virasoro algebra. It is based on the
decoupling of (already known) singular fields in the fusion process. We show
how to extend their algorithm to the Neveu-Schwarz superalgebra.
