<title>
On the quantization of the N=2 supersymmetric non linear sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for quantizing the bidimensional N=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma
model is developed. This method is both covariant under coordinate
transformations (concerning the order relevant for calculations) and explicitly
N=2 supersymmetric. The OPE of the supercurrent is computed accordingly,
including also the dilaton. By imposing the N=2 superconformal algebra the
equations for the metric and dilaton are obtained. In particular, they imply
that the dilaton is a constant.
