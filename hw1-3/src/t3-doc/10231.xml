Solving Four Dimensional Field Theories with the Dirichlet Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  The realization of ${\cal N}=2$ four dimensional super Yang-Mills theories in
terms of a single Dirichlet fivebrane in type IIB string theory is considered.
A classical brane computation reproduces the full quantum low energy effective
action. This result has a simple explanation in terms of mirror symmetry.
