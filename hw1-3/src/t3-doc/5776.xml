M Theory Extensions of T Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  T duality expresses the equivalence of a superstring theory compactified on a
manifold K to another (possibly the same) superstring theory compactified on a
dual manifold K'. The volumes of K and K' are inversely proportional. In this
talk we consider two M theory generalizations of T duality: (i) M theory
compactified on a torus is equivalent to type IIB superstring theory
compactified on a circle and (ii) M theory compactified on a cylinder is
equivalent to SO(32) superstring theory compactified on a circle. In both cases
the size of the circle is proportional to the -3/4 power of the area of the
dual manifold.
