DILATON-DRIVEN INFLATION IN STRING COSMOLOGY
</title>

<abstract>
  I present an outline for cosmological evolution in the framework of string
theory with emphasis on a phase of dilaton-driven kinetic inflation. It is
shown that a typical background of stochastic gravitational radiation is
generated, with strength that may allow its detection in future gravity wave
experiments.
