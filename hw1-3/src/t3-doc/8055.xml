Recent Developments in Fractional Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  Fractional superstrings experience new types of ``internal projections''
which alter or deform their underlying worldsheet conformal field theories.
In this talk I summarize some recent results concerning both the worldsheet
theory which remains after the internal projections have acted, and the
spacetime statistics properties of its various sectors.
