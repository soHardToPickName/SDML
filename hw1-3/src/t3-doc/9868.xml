<title>
The TBA, the Gross-Neveu Model, and Polyacetylene
</title>

<abstract>
  We summarize recent work showing how the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz may be
used to study the finite-density first-order phase transition in the
Gross-Neveu model. The application to trans-polyacetylene is discussed, and the
significance of the results is addressed.
