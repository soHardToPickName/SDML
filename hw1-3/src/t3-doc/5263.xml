<title>
General compact quantum groups, a tutorial
</title>

<abstract>
  A tutorial introduction is given to general Hopf algebras and
to general compact quantum groups. In the definition and further treatment
of compact quantum groups C*-algebras are avoided. Contact with
Woronowicz's compact matrix quantum groups is made at a later stage.
