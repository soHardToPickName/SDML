<title>
Strong oscillations of cumulants of photon distribution function in
  slightly squeezed states
</title>

<abstract>
  The cumulants and factorial moments of photon distribution for squeezed and
correlated light are calculated in terms of Chebyshev, Legendre and Laguerre
polynomials. The phenomenon of strong oscillations of the ratio of the cumulant
to factorial moment is found.
