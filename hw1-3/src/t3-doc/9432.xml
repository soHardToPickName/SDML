On the ERG approach in $3 - d$ Well Developed Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the method of the Renormalization Group (GR), following the
Polchinski point of view, to a model of well developed and isotropic fluid
turbulence. The Galilei-invariance is preserved and a universal behavior,
related to the change of the stochastic stirring force, is evident by the
numerical results in the inertial region, where a scale-invariant behavior also
appear. The expected power law of the energy spectrum ($q^{-{5\over 3}}$) is
obtained and the Kolmogorov constant $C_K$ agrees with experimental data.
