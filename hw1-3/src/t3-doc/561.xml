<title>
The Superworld
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview of supersymmetry and its different applications is presented. We
motivate supersymmetry in particle physics. We then explain how supersymmetry
helps us analyze field theories exactly, and what dynamical lessons these
solutions teach us. Finally, we describe how supersymmetry is used to derive
exact results in string theory. These results have led to a revolution in our
understanding of the theory.
