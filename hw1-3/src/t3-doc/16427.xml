<title>
The central charge in three dimensional anti-de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper collects the various ways of computing the central charge
$c=3l/2G$ arising in 3d asymptotically anti-de Sitter spaces, in the
Chern-Simons formulation. Their similarities and differences are displayed.
