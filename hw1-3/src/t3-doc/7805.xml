<title>
Ectoplasm Has No Topology
</title>

<abstract>
  In a new approach to the theory of integration over Wess-Zumino
supermanifolds, we suggest that a fundamental principle is their consistency
with an ``Ethereal Conjecture'' that asserts the topology of the supermanifold
must be generated essentially from its bosonic submanifold. This naturally
leads to a theory of ``ectoplasmic'' integration based on super p-forms. One
consequence of this approach is that the derivation of ``density projection
operators'' becomes trivial in a number of supergravity theories.
