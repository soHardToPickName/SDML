<title>
Solution of a Relativistic Three-Body Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a relativistic s-wave scattering length model for the two
particle input we construct an unambiguous, unitary solution of the
relativistic three body problem given only the masses $m_a,m_b,m_c$ and the
masses of the two body bound states $\mu_{bc},\mu_{ca},\mu_{ab}$.
