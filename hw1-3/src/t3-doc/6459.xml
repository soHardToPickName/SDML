<title>
Topological Dilatonic Supergravity Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a central extension of the $(m,n)$ super-Poincar\'e algebra in two
dimensions. Besides the usual Poincar\'e generators and the $(m,n)$
supersymmetry generators we have $(m,n)$ Grassmann generators, a bosonic
internal symmetry generator and a central charge. We then build up the
topological gauge theory associated to this algebra. We can solve the classical
field equations for the fields which do not belong to the supergravity
multiplet and to a Lagrange multiplier multiplet. The resulting topological
supergravity theory turns out to be non-local in the fermionic sector.
