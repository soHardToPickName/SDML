Hitchin Systems at Low Genera
</title>

<abstract>
  The paper gives a quick account of the simplest cases of the Hitchin
integrable systems and of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard connection at
genus 0, 1 and 2. In particular, we construct the action-angle variables of the
genus 2 Hitchin system with group SL(2) by exploiting its relation to the
classical Neumann integrable systems.
