On the supersymmetric non-abelian Born-Infeld action
</title>

<abstract>
  We review an iterative construction of the supersymmetric non-abelian
Born-Infeld action. We obtain the action through second order in the
fieldstrength. Kappa-invariance fixes the ordenings which turn out to deviate
from the symmetrized trace proposal.
