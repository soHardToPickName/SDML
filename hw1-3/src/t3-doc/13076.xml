Yang-Mills Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  Two results are presented for reduced Yang-Mills integrals with different
symmetry groups and dimensions: the first is a compact integral representation
in terms of the relevant variables of the integral, the second is a method to
analytically evaluate the integrals in cases of low order. This is exhibited by
evaluating a Yang-Mills integral over real symmetric matrices of order 3.
