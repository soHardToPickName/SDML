<title>
Torus structure on graphs and twisted partition functions for minimal
  and affine models
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Ocneanu quantum geometry of ADE diagrams (and of other diagrams
belonging to higher Coxeter-Dynkin systems), we discuss the classification of
twisted partition functions for affine and minimal models in conformal field
theory and study several examples associated with the WZW, Virasoro and W_{3}
cases.
