<title>
Non-perturbative Quantum Theories and Integrable Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the appearance of classical integrable systems as an effective tool
for the description of non-perturbative exact results in quantum string and
gauge theories. Various aspects of this relation: spectral curves, action-angle
variables, Whitham deformations and associativity equations are considered
separately demonstrating hidden parallels between topological 2d string
theories and naively non-topological 4d theories. The proofs are supplemented
by explicit illustrative examples.
