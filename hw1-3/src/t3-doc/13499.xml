<title>
Scalar-Tensor Theory of Gravity on $M_4\times Z_{2}$ Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In the Brans-Dicke(BD) theory on $M_{4}\times Z_{2}$ geometry the geometrical
meaning of the torsion is clarified. The BD theory on $M_{4}\times Z_{2}$ is
rederived by taking into account of a new isometry condition.
