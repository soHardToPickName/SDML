The One Loop Effective Action of QED for a General Class of Electric
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the effective action of QED at one loop order for an electric
field which points in the $\hat{z}$ direction and depends arbitrarily upon the
light cone time coordinate, $x^+ = (x^0 + x^3)/\sqrt{2}$. This calculation
generalizes Schwinger's formula for the vacuum persistence probability in the
presence of a constant electric field.
