<title>
Large distance asymptotic behavior of the emptiness formation
  probability of the XXZ spin-1/2 Heisenberg chain
</title>

<abstract>
  Using its multiple integral representation, we compute the large distance
asymptotic behavior of the emptiness formation probability of the XXZ spin-1/2
Heisenberg chain in the massless regime.
