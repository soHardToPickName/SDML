Geometry Associated with Self-dual Yang-Mills and the Chiral Model
  Approaches to Self-dual Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometric formulation of the Moyal deformation for the Self-dual Yang-Mills
theory and the Chiral Model approach to Self-dual gravity is given. We find in
Fedosov's geometrical construction of deformation quantization the natural
geometrical framework associated to the Moyal deformation of the
six-dimensional version of the second heavenly equation and the Park-Husain
heavenly equation. The Wess-Zumino-Witten-like Lagrangian of Self-dual gravity
is re-examined within this context.
