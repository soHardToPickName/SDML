S-Duality and Noncommutative Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is conjectured that strongly coupled, spatially noncommutative $\CN=4$
Yang-Mills theory has a dual description as a weakly coupled open string theory
in a near critical electric field, and that this dual theory is fully decoupled
from closed strings. Evidence for this conjecture is given by the absence of
physical closed string poles in the non-planar one-loop open string diagram.
The open string theory can be viewed as living in a geometry in which space and
time coordinates do not commute.
