<title>
The structure of the spectrum of anomalous dimensions in the N-vector
  model in 4-epsilon dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In a recent publication we have investigated the spectrum of anomalous
dimensions for arbitrary composite operators in the critical N-vector model in
4-epsilon dimensions. We could establish properties like upper and lower bounds
for the anomalous dimensions in one-loop order. In this paper we extend these
results and explicitly derive parts of the one-loop spectrum of anomalous
dimensions. This analysis becomes possible by an explicit representation of the
conformal symmetry group on the operator algebra. Still the structure of the
spectrum of anomalous dimensions is quite complicated and does generally not
resemble the algebraic structures familiar from two dimensional conformal field
theories.
