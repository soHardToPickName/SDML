Computing noncommutative Chern-Simons theory radiative corrections on
  the back of an envelope
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the renormalized U(N) noncommutative Chern-Simons theory can be
defined in perturbation theory so that there are no loop corrections to the 1PI
functional of the theory in an arbitrary homogeneous axial (time-like,
light-like or space-like) gauge. We define the free propagators of the fields
of the theory by using the Leibbrandt-Mandelstam prescription --which allows
Wick rotation and is consistent with power-counting-- and regularize its Green
functions with the help of a family of regulators which explicitly preserve the
infinitesimal vector Grassmann symmetry of the theory. We also show that in
perturbation theory the nonvanishing Green functions of the elementary fields
of the theory are products of the free propagators.
