Ten arguments for the essence of special relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  In searching for the essence of special relativity, we have been gradually
accumulating ten arguments focusing on one fundamental postulate based on
quantum mechanics.A particle is always not pure. It always contain two
contradictory fields, $\phi(\vec{x},t)$ and $\chi(\vec{x},t)$,which are coupled
together with the symmetry $\phi(-\vec{x},-t)\longrightarrow\chi(\vec{x},t)$
and $\chi(-\vec{x},-t)\longrightarrow\phi(\vec{x},t)$.
