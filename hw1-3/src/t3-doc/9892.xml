<title>
Fuzzy Actions and their Continuum Limits
</title>

<abstract>
  Previously matrix model actions for ``fuzzy'' fields have been proposed using
non-commutative geometry. They retained ``topological'' properties extremely
well, being capable of describing instantons, $\theta$--states, the chiral
anomaly, and even chiral fermions with no ``doubling''. Here, we demonstrate
that the standard scalar and spinor actions on a $d$--dimensional manifold are
recovered from such actions in the limit of large matrices if their
normalizations are correctly scaled as the limit is taken.
