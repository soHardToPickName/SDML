<title>
Wall and Anti-Wall in the Randall-Sundrum Model and A New Infrared
  Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  An approach to find the field equation solution of the Randall-Sundrum model
with the $S^1/Z_2$ extra axis is presented. We closely examine the infrared
singularity. The vacuum is set by the 5 dimensional Higgs field. Both the
domain-wall and the anti-domain-wall naturally appear, at the {\it ends} of the
extra compact axis, by taking a {\it new infrared regularization}. The
stability is guaranteed from the outset by the kink boundary condition. A {\it
continuous} (infrared-)regularized solution, which is a truncated {\it Fourier
series} of a {\it discontinuous} solution, is utilized.The ultraviolet-infrared
relation appears in the regularized solution.
