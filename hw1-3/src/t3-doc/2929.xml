Darboux-Backlund Solutions of SL(p,q) KP-KdV Hierarchies, Constrained
  Generalized Toda Lattices, and Two-Matrix String Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an unifying description of the graded $SL(p,q)$ KP-KdV
hierarchies, including the Wronskian construction of their tau-functions as
well as the coefficients of the pertinent Lax operators, obtained via
successive applications of special Darboux-B\"{a}cklund transformations. The
emerging Darboux-B\"{a}cklund structure is identified as a constrained
generalized Toda lattice system relevant for the two-matrix string model. Also,
the exact Wronskian solution for the two-matrix model partition function is
found.
