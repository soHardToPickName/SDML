Branes and Fluxes in D=5 Calabi-Yau Compactifications of M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss Poincare three-brane solutions in D=5 M-Theory compactifications
on Calabi-Yau (CY) threefolds with G-fluxes. We show that the vector moduli
freeze at an attractor point. In the case with background flux only, the
spacetime geometry contains a zero volume singularity with the three-brane and
the CY space shrinking simultaneously to a point. This problem can be avoided
by including explicit three-brane sources. We consider two cases in detail: a
single brane and, when the transverse dimension is compactified on a circle, a
pair of branes with opposite tensions.
