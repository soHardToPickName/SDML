Feynman Rules in N=2 projective superspace III: Yang-Mills multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  The kinetic action of the N=2 Yang-Mills vector multiplet can be written in
projective N=2 superspace using projective multiplets. It is possible to
perform a simple N=2 gauge fixing, which translated to N=1 component language
makes the kinetic terms of gauge potentials invertible. After coupling the
Yang-Mills multiplet to unconstrained sources it is very simple to integrate
out the gauge fixed vector multiplet from the path integral of the free theory
and obtain the N=2 propagator. Its reduction to N=1 components agrees with the
propagators of the gauge fixed N=1 component superfields. The coupling of
Yang-Mills multiplets and hypermultiplets in N=2 projective superspace allows
us to define Feynman rules in N=2 superspace for these two fields.
