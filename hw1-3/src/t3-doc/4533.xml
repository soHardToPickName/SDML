<title>
On T-duality in dilatonic gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Under the assumption of axial symmetry we introduce a map from dilatonic
gravity to a string-like action. This map allows one to introduce, in a rather
simple way, the equivalent of string theory T-duality in dilatonic gravity.
Here we choose the duality group to be an $SO(2,1)$ group and, for a particular
rotation, we recover a symmetry of dilatonic gravity discussed previously in
the literature.
