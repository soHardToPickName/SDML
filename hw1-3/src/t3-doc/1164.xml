Two Two-Dimensional Supergravity Theories from Calabi-Yau Four-Folds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two-dimensional supergravity theories with four supercharges
constructed from compactification of Type II string theory on a generic
Calabi-Yau four-fold. In Type IIA and Type IIB cases, respectively, new
superspace formulations of N=(2,2) and N=(0,4) dilaton supergravities are found
and their coupling to matter multiplets is discussed.
