Low Level Representations for E10 and E11
</title>

<abstract>
  We work out the decomposition of the indefinite Kac Moody algebras ${E_{10}}$
and ${E_{11}}$ w.r.t. their respective subalgebras $A_9$ and $A_{10}$ at low
levels. Tables of the irreducible representations with their outer
multiplicities are presented for ${E_{10}}$ up to level $\ell = 18$ and for
${E_{11}}$ up to level $\ell =10$. On the way we confirm and extend existing
results for ${E_{10}}$ root multiplicities, and for the first time compute
non-trivial root multiplicities of ${E_{11}}$.
