<title>
Anomaly and Thermodynamics for 2D Spinors in the Aharonov--Bohm Gauge
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  The axial anomaly is computed for Euclidean Dirac fermions on the plane. The
dependence upon the self-adjoint extensions of the Dirac operator is
investigated and its relevance concerning the second virial coefficient of the
anyon gas is discussed.
