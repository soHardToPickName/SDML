<title>
CP^{N-1} models and the Quantized 2D Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We have examined the coupled system of the dilaton gravity and the $CP^{N-1}$
theory known as a model of the confinement of massive scalar quarks. After the
quantization of the system, we could see the quantum effect of the gravitation
on the coupling constant of $CP^{N-1}$ model and how the coupling constant of
dynamically induced gauge field changes near the black hole configuration.
