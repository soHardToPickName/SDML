<title>
Dynamical mapping method in nonrelativistic models of quantum field
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The solutions of Heisenberg equations and two-particles eigenvalue problems
for nonrelativistic models of current-current fermion interaction and $N,
\Theta $ model are obtained in the frameworks of dynamical mapping method. The
equivalence of different types of dynamical mapping is shown. The connection
between renormalization procedure and theory of selfadjoint extensions is
elucidated.
