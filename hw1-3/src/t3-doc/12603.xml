WDVV Equations in Seiberg-Witten theory and associative algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short review of the results on the associativity algebras and WDVV
equations found recently for the Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 4d SUSY gauge
theories. The presentation is mostly based on the integrable treatment of these
solutions.
