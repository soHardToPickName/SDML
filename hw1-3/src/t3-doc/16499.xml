</title>

<abstract>
  Lectures at the 1998 Les Houches Summer School: Topological Aspects of Low
Dimensional Systems. These lectures contain an introduction to various aspects
of Chern-Simons gauge theory: (i) basics of planar field theory, (ii) canonical
quantization of Chern-Simons theory, (iii) Chern-Simons vortices, and (iv)
radiatively induced Chern-Simons terms.
