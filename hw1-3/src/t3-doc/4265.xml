<title>
Character Expansions, Itzykson-Zuber Integrals, and the QCD Partition
  Function
</title>

<abstract>
  A combinatorial formula to generate U(N) character expansions is presented.
It is shown that the resulting character expansion formulas greatly simplify a
number of problems where integrals over the group manifolds need to be
calculated. Several examples are given, including direct and very quick
calculations of the Itzykson-Zuber integral and the finite volume effective
partition function of QCD in the sector with a given topological charge.
