<title>
Duality in SUSY $SU(N)$ with an Antisymmetric Tensor
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a dual description for $SU(N)$ supersymmetric gauge theory with an
antisymmetric tensor and fundamentals, and no superpotential. This duality is
derived from the dualities of Seiberg. Under a perturbation of the
superpotential, the dual theory breaks supersymmetry at tree level.
