<title>
Explicit thermostatics of certain classical one-dimensional lattice
  models by harmonic analysis
</title>

<abstract>
  A certain class of one-dimensional classical lattice models is considered.
Using the method of abstract harmonic analysis explicit thermostatic properties
of such models are derived. In particular, we discuss the low-temperature
behavior of some of these models.
