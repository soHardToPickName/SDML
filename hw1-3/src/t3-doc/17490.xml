Topological Charges of Noncommutative Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  The noncommutative soliton is characterized by the use of the projection
operators in non-commutative space. By using the close relation with the
K-theory of $C^*$-algebra, we consider the variations of projection operators
along the commutative directions and identify their topological charges. When
applied to the string theory, it gives the modification of the brane charges
due to tachyon background.
