<title>
Scattering of string-waves on black hole background
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the propagation of perturbations along an infinitely long
stationary open string in the background of a Schwarzschild black hole. The
equations of motion for the perturbations in the 2 transverse physical
directions are solved to second order in a weak field expansion. We then set up
a scattering formalism where an ingoing wave is partly transmitted and partly
reflected due to the interaction with the gravitational field of the black
hole. We finally calculate the reflection coefficient to third order in our
weak field expansion.
