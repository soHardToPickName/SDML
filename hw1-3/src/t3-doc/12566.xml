Newton potential in deSitter braneworld
</title>

<abstract>
  Using graviton correlator on deSitter (dS) brane in 5d AdS or dS bulk we
calculate the four-dimensional Newton potential. For flat brane in AdS bulk the
Randall-Sundrum result is recovered. For flat brane in dS bulk the sign of
subleading ($1/r^3$) term in Newton potential is negative if compare with AdS
bulk. In accordance with dS/CFT correspondence this indicates that dual CFT
should be non-unitary (for example, higher derivative conformal theory).
