Comments on duality-symmetric theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review the basics of electric-magnetic duality symmetry and their
geometric interpretation in the M-theory context. Then we recall some no-go
theorems that prevent a simple extension of the duality symmetry to non-Abelian
gauge theories.
