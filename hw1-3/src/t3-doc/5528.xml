Orbifolds of M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Z2-orbifolds of 11-dimensional M-theory on tori of various
dimensions. The most interesting model (besides the known S1/Z2 case)
corresponds to T5/Z2, for which we argue that the resulting six-dimensional
theory is equivalent to the type IIB string compactified on K3. Gravitational
anomaly cancellation plays a crucial role in determining what states appear in
the twisted sector. Most of the other models appear to break spacetime
supersymmetry. We observe that M-theory tends to produce chiral
compactifications on orbifolds, and that our results may provide an insight
into the mechanism by which twisted-sector states arise in this hypothetical
theory.
