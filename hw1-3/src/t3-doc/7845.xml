<title>
Unexpected symmetries in classical moduli spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the structure of the moduli space of a supersymmetric SU(5) chiral
gauge theory with two matter fields in the 10 representation, and two fields in
the \bar{5} representation. Inspection of the exact Kahler potential of the
classical moduli space shows that the symmetry group of the moduli space is
larger than the global symmetry group of the underlying gauge theory. As a
consequence, the gauge theory has classical inequivalent vacua which yield
identical low energy theories.
