<title>
A Strong Coupling Test of S-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  By studying the partition function of $N=4$ topologically twisted
supersymmetric Yang-Mills on four-manifolds, we make an exact strong coupling
test of the Montonen-Olive strong-weak duality conjecture. Unexpected and
exciting links are found with two-dimensional rational conformal field theory.
