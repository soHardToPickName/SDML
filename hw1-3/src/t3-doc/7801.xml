Finite size effects in perturbed boundary conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the finite-size properties of a simple integrable quantum field
theory in 1+1 dimensions with non-trivial boundary conditions. Novel
off-critical identities between cylinder partition functions of models with
differing boundary conditions are derived.
