Fusion potentials I
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the conjecture by Gepner that the fusion ring of a rational
conformal field theory is isomorphic to a ring of polynomials in $n$ variables
quotiented by an ideal of constraints that derive from a potential. We show
that in a variety of cases, this is indeed true with {\it one-variable}
polynomials.
