<title>
The long delayed solution of the Bukhvostov Lipatov model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper I complete the solution of the Bukhvostov Lipatov model by
computing the physical excitations and their factorized S matrix. I also
explain the paradoxes which led in recent years to the suspicion that the model
may not be integrable.
