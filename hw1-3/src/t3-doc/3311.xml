<title>
A geometrical interpretation of parity violation in gravity with torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  In a space-time with torsion, the action for the gravitational field can be
extended with a parity-violating piece. We show how to obtain such a piece from
geometry itself, by suitably modifying the affine connection so as to include a
pseudo-tensorial part. A consistent method is thus suggested for incorporating
parity-violation in the Lagrangians of all matter fields with spin in a
space-time background with torsion.
