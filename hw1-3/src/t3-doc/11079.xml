GKZ Hypergeometric Systems and Applications to Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze GKZ(Gel'fand, Kapranov and Zelevinski) hypergeometric systems and
apply them to study the quantum cohomology rings of Calabi-Yau manifolds. We
will relate properties of the local solutions near the large radius limit to
the intersection rings of a toric variety and of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.
