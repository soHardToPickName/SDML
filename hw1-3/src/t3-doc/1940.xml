<title>
The action of N=4 Super Yang-Mills from a chiral primary operator
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Vafa-Witten twisted version of N=4 Super Yang-Mills a subset of the
supercharges actually relevant for the nonrenormalization properties of the
theory is identified. In particular, a relationship between the gauge-fixed
action and the chiral primary operator tr(\phi)^2 is worked out. This result
can be understood as an off-shell extension of the reduction formula introduced
by Intriligator.
