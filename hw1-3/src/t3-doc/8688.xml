On Localization and Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  Different regularizations are studied in localization of path integrals. We
discuss the effect of the choice of regularization by evaluating the partition
functions for the harmonic oscillator and the Weyl character for SU(2). In
particular, we solve the Weyl shift problem that arises in path integral
evaluation of the Weyl character by using the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer
$\eta$-invariant and the Borel-Weil theory.
