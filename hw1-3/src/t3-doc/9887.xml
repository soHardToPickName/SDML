<title>
A note on the interactions of compactified D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the vacuum one loop amplitude for two D-strings at an angle
compactified on $T^2$ as a function of the transverse separation and the
winding numbers. We show that in certain cases the amplitude is independent on
whether the D-strings are compactified or not.
