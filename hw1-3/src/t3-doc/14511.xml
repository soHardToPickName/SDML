<title>
Low-energy quantum string cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a Wheeler-De Witt approach to quantum cosmology based on the
low-energy string effective action, with an effective dilaton potential
included to account for non-perturbative effects and, possibly, higher-order
corrections. We classify, in particular, four different classes of scattering
processes in minisuperspace, and discuss their relevance for the solution of
the graceful exit problem.
