<title>
Bound states by a pseudoscalar Coulomb potential in 1+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The Dirac equation is solved for a pseudoscalar Coulomb potential in a
two-dimensional world. An infinite sequence of bounded solutions are obtained.
These results are in sharp contrast with those ones obtained in 3+1 dimensions
where no bound-state solutions are found.
