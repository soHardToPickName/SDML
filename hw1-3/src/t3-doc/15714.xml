<title>
Canonical quantisation of thermal gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Canonical quantisation gives a new and convenient finite-temperature
perturbation theory in covariant gauges, and solves the problem of the
zero-frequency mode in the temporal gauge. [Talk at Workshop on Thermal Field
Theories and their Applications, Banff, August 1993]
