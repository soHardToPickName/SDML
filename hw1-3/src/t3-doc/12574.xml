<title>
Combinatorial and topological phase structure of non-perturbative
  n-dimensional quantum gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a non-perturbative geometrical characterization of the partition
function of $n$-dimensional quantum gravity based on a coarse classification of
riemannian geometries. We show that, under natural geometrical constraints, the
theory admits a continuum limit with a non-trivial phase structure parametrized
by the homotopy types of the class of manifolds considered. The results
obtained qualitatively coincide, when specialized to dimension two, with those
of two-dimensional quantum gravity models based on random triangulations of
surfaces.
