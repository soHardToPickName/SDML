BRST - BFV analysis of anomalies in bosonic string theory interacting
  with background gravitational field
</title>

<abstract>
  The general BRST-BFV analysis of anomaly in the string theory coupled to
background fields is carried out. An exact equation for c-valued symbol of
anomaly operator is found and structure of its solutions is studied.
