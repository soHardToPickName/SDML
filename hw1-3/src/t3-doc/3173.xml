A Note on Functional Integral over the Local Gauge Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluated some particular type of functional integral over the local gauge
group C^{\infty}({\bf R}^n, U(1)) by going to a discretized lattice. The
results explicitly violates the property of the Haar measure. We also analysed
the Faddeev-Popov method through a toy example. The results also violates the
property of the Haar measure.
