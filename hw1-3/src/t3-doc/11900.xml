K-Theory from a physical perspective
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an expository paper which aims at explaining a physical point of view
on the K-theoretic classification of D-branes. We combine ideas of
renormalization group flows between boundary conformal field theories, together
with spacetime notions such as anomaly cancellation and D-brane instanton
effects. We illustrate this point of view by describing the twisted K-theory of
the special unitary groups SU(N).
