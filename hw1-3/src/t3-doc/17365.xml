A Note on Strings in a Rindler Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study bosonic strings in a Rindler background using a D-23 brane. This
model is shown to be directly related to the orbifold approach to Rindler
strings. We propose a duality between these pictures based on comparisons of
their closed string spectra.
