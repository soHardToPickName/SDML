An Itzykson-Zuber-like Integral and Diffusion for Complex Ordinary and
  Supermatrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute an analogue of the Itzykson-Zuber integral for the case of
arbitrary complex matrices. The calculation is done for both ordinary and
supermatrices by transferring the Itzykson-Zuber diffusion equation method to
the space of arbitrary complex matrices. The integral is of interest for
applications in Quantum Chromodynamics and the theory of two-dimensional
Quantum Gravity.
