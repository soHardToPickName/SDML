Canonical Equivalence between Super D-string and Type IIB Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the super D-string action is canonically equivalent to the type
IIB superstring action with a world-sheet gauge field. Canonical transformation
to the type IIB theory with dynamical tension is also constructed to establish
the SL(2,Z) covariance beyond the semi-classical approximations.
