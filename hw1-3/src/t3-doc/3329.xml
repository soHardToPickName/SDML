<title>
Higher-Derivative Boson Field Theories and Constrained Second-Order
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  As an alternative to the covariant Ostrogradski method, we show that
higher-derivative relativistic Lagrangian field theories can be reduced to
second differential-order by writing them directly as covariant two-derivative
theories involving Lagrange multipliers and new fields. Despite the intrinsic
non-covariance of the Dirac's procedure used to deal with the constraints, the
explicit Lorentz invariance is recovered at the end. We develop this new
setting on the grounds of a simple scalar model and then its applications to
generalized electrodynamics and higher-derivative gravity are worked out. For a
wide class of field theories this method is better suited than Ostrogradski's
for a generalization to 2n-derivative theories
