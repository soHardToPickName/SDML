<title>
Matrix Theory and U-Duality in Seven Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the emergence of the U-duality group in compactification of
Matrix theory on a 4-torus. The discussion involves non-trivial effects in
strongly coupled 4+1 dimensional gauge theory, and highlights some interesting
phenomena in the Matrix theory description of compactified M-theory.
