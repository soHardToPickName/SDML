Radiatively Induced Lorentz and CPT Violation in QED at Finite
  Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we evaluate the induced Lorentz and CPT violating Chern-Simons
term in the QED action at finite temperature. We do this using the method of
derivative expansion of fermion determinants. Also, we use the imaginary-time
formalism to calculate the temperature dependence of the Chern-Simons term
