<title>
On the Composition of Gauge Structures
</title>

<abstract>
  A formulation for a non-trivial composition of two classical gauge structures
is given: Two parent gauge structures of a common base space are synthesized so
as to obtain a daughter structure which is fundamental by itself. The model is
based on a pair of related connections that take their values in the product
space of the corresponding Lie algebras. The curvature, the covariant exterior
derivatives and the associated structural identities, all get contributions
from both gauge groups. The various induced structures are classified into
those whose composition is given just by trivial means, and those which possess
an irreducible nature. The pure irreducible piece, in particular, generates a
complete super-space of ghosts with an attendant set of super-BRST variation
laws, both of which are purely of a geometrical origin.
