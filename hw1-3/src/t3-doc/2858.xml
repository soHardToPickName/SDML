Notes on Euclidean de Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss issues relating to the topology of Euclidean de Sitter space. We
show that in (2+1) dimensions, the Euclidean continuation of the`causal
diamond', i.e the region of spacetime accessible to a timelike observer, is a
three-hemisphere. However, when de Sitter entropy is computed in a `stretched
horizon' picture, then we argue that the correct Euclidean topology is a solid
torus. The solid torus shrinks and degenerates into a three-hemisphere as one
goes from the `stretched horizon' to the horizon, giving the Euclidean
continuation of the causal diamond. We finally comment on the generalisation of
these results to higher dimensions.
