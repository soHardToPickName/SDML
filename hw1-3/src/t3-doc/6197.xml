Deformed fields and Moyal construction of deformed super Virasoro
  algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  Studied is the deformation of super Virasoro algebra proposed by Belov and
Chaltikhian. Starting from abstract realizations in terms of the FFZ type
generators, various connections of them to other realizations are shown,
especially to deformed field representations, whose bosonic part generator is
recently reported as a deformed string theory on a noncommutative world-sheet.
The deformed Virasoro generators can also be expressed in terms of ordinary
free fields in a highly nontrivial way.
