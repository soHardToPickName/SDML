<title>
Field-Antifield formalism for Anomalous Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  An extension of the Field-Antifield formalism to treat anomalous gauge
theories with a closed, irreducible classical gauge algebra is proposed.
Introducing extra degrees of freedom, we construct the gauge transformations
for these new fields, the Wess-Zumino term and the corresponding measure.
