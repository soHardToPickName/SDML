<title>
Squeezing in a 2-D generalized oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  A two-dimensional generalized oscillator with time-dependent parameters is
considered to study the two-mode squeezing phenomena. Specific choices of the
parameters are used to determine the dispersion matrix and analytic
expressions, in terms of standard hermite polynomials, of the wavefunctions and
photon distributions. (to be publish in the Third Workshop on Squeezed States
and Uncertainty Relations, Baltimore, USA, (August 1993))
