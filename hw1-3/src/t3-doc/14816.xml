<title>
A Canonical Approach to Duality Transformations
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Buscher's abelian duality transformation rules can be recovered
in a very simple way by performing a canonical transformation first suggested
by Giveon, Rabinovici and Veneziano. We explore the properties of this
transformation, and also discuss some aspects of non-abelian duality.
