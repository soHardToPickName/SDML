Constraints on $AdS_5$ Embeddings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the embedding of either a static or a time dependent maximally
3-symmetric brane with non-zero spatial curvature $k$ into a non-compactified
$AdS_5$ bulk does not yield exponential suppression of the geometry away from
the brane. Implications of this result for brane-localized gravity are
discussed.
