Renormalization Group in Zero-Point Energy Calculations
</title>

<abstract>
  The simple consequences of the renormalization group invariance in
calculations of the ground state energy for models of confined quantum fields
are discussed. The case of (1+1)D MIT quark bag model is considered in detail.
