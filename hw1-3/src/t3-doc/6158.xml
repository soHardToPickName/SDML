String Theory in Magnetic Monopole Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss string propagation in the near-horizon geometry generated by
Neveu-Schwarz fivebranes, Kaluza-Klein monopoles and fundamental strings. When
the fivebranes and KK monopoles are wrapped around a compact four-manifold
$\MM$, the geometry is $AdS_3\times S^3/\ZZ_N\times \MM$ and the spacetime
dynamics is expected to correspond to a local two dimensional conformal field
theory. We determine the moduli space of spacetime CFT's, study the spectrum of
the theory and compare the chiral primary operators obtained in string theory
to supergravity expectations.
