B-V Quantization in 2-D Gravity and New Conformal Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the properties of 2-D gravity in the Batalin and Vilkovisky
quantization scheme. We find a factorized structure which exhibits duality
properties analogous to those existing in the topological theories of forms.
New conformal field are introduced with their invariant action.
