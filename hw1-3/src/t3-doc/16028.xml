Topological symmetry breaking and the confinement of anyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study topological symmetry breaking via the behaviour of Wilson and 't
Hooft loop operators for the 2+1 dimenesional Abelian-Higgs model with
Chern-Simons term. The topological linking of instantons, which are closed
vortex loop configurations, give rise to a long-range, logarithmic, confining
potential between electric charges and magnetic flux tubes even though all
perturbative forces are short range. Gauss' law forces the concomitance of
charge and magnetic flux, hence the confinement is actually of anyons.
