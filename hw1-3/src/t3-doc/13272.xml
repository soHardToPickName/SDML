Massive-Scalar Effective Actions on Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Closed forms are derived for the effective actions for free, massive spinless
fields in anti-de Sitter spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. The results have
simple expressions in terms of elementary functions (for odd dimensions) or
multiple Gamma functions (for even dimensions). We use these to argue against
the quantum validity of a recently-proposed duality relating such theories with
differing masses and cosmological constants.
