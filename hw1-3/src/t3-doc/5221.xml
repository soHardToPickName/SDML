Entropy for dilatonic black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  The area formula for entropy is extended to the case of a dilatonic black
hole. The entropy of a scalar field in the background of such a black hole is
calculated semiclassically. The area and cutoff dependences are normal {\it
except in the extremal case}, where the area is zero but the entropy nonzero.
