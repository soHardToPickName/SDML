Duality in nonlinear B$\wedge$F models: equivalence between self-dual
  and topologically massive Born-Infeld B$\wedge$F models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dual equivalence between the nonlinear generalization of the
self-dual ($NSD_{B\wedge F}$) and the topologically massive $B\wedge F$ models
with particular emphasis on the nonlinear electrodynamics proposed by Born and
Infeld. This is done through a dynamical gauge embedding of the nonlinear
self-dual model yielding to a gauge invariant and dynamically equivalent
theory. We clearly show that nonpolinomial $NSD_{B\wedge F}$ models can be
mapped, through a properly defined duality transformation, into $TM_{B\wedge
F}$ actions. The general result obtained is then particularized for a number of
examples, including the Born-Infeld-BF (BIBF) model that has experienced a
revival in the recent literature.
