Some interesting violations of the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that AdS_5 x T^{pq} is unstable, in the sense of Breitenlohner
and Freedman, for unequal p and q. This settles, negatively, the long-standing
question of whether the T^{pq} manifolds for unequal p and q might correspond
to non-supersymmetric fixed points of the renormalization group. We also show
that the AdS_3 x S^7 vacuum of Sugimoto's USp(32) open string theory is
unstable. This explains, at a heuristic level, the apparent absence of a
heterotic string dual.
