Trouble For Remnants
</title>

<abstract>
  An argument is presented for the inconsistency of black hole remnants which
store the information which falls into black holes. Unlike previous arguments
it is not concerned with a possible divergence in the rate of pair production.
It is argued that the existence of remnants in the thermal atmosphere of
Rindler space will drive the renormalized Newton constant to zero.
