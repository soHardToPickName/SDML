BRST quantization of relativistic particles on inner product spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent results of BRST quantization on inner product spaces are reviewed. It
is shown how relativistic particle models may be quantized with finite norms
and that the relation between the operator method and the conventional path
integral treatments is nontrivial.
