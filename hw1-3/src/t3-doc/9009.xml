<title>
Perturbative Quantum (In)equivalence of Dual $\sigma$ Models in $2$
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Various examples of target space duality transformations are investigated up
to two loop order in perturbation theory. Our results show that when using the
tree level (`naive') transformation rules the dual theories are in general {\it
inequivalent} at two loops to the original ones, (both for the Abelian and the
non Abelian duality).
