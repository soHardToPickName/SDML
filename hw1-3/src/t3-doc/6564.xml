<title>
Superfield Covariant Quantization with BRST Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the method of superfield Lagrangian BRST quantization in the
part of the gauge-fixing procedure and obtain a quantization method that can be
considered as an alternative to the Batalin - Vilkovisky formalism.
