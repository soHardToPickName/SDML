<title>
Non-universal corrections to the tension ratios in softly broken N=2
  SU(N) gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Calculation by Douglas and Shenker of the tension ratios for vortices of
different N-alities in the softly broken N=2 supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills
theory, is carried to the second order in the adjoint multiplet mass m.
Corrections to the ratios violating the well-known sine formula are found,
showing that it is not a universal quantity.
