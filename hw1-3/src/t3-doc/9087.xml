Comments on Dirichlet Branes at Angles
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper illustrates the derivation of the low-energy background field
solutions of D2-branes and D4-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles by
solving directly the bosonic equations of motion of II supergravity coupled to
a dilaton and antisymmetric fields. We also argue for how a similar analysis
can be performed for any similar Dp-branes oriented at angles. Finally, the
calculation presented here serves as a basis in the search for a systematic
derivation of the background fields of the more general configuration of a
p-brane `angled' with a q-brane ($p \neq q$).
