<title>
Supersymmetric Field-Theoretic Models on a Supermanifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an extension of some structural aspects that have successfully
been applied in the development of the theory of quantum fields propagating on
a general spacetime manifold so as to include superfield models on a
supermanifold.
