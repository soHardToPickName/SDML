<title>
Non-Bogomolny SU(N) BPS Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  For N>2 we present static monopole solutions of the second order SU(N) BPS
Yang-Mills-Higgs equations which are not solutions of the first order Bogomolny
equations. These spherically symmetric solutions may be interpreted as monopole
anti-monopole configurations and their construction involves harmonic maps into
complex projective spaces.
