<title>
Gribov ambiguities and the fundamental domain
</title>

<abstract>
  This lecture is dedicated to the memory of Vladimir Gribov.
  We discuss the procedure of complete gauge fixing to avoid Gribov copies, as
well as results for the low-lying glueball spectrum in intermediate volumes for
the torus and for the sphere that became available recently.
