String junctions on backgrounds with a positively charged orientifold
  plane
</title>

<abstract>
  By means of the heterotic/type IIB duality, we study properties of junctions
on backgrounds with a positively charged orientifold seven-plane and D-branes,
which are expected to give seven dimensional Sp(r) gauge theories. We give a
modified BPS condition for the junctions and show that it reproduces the
adjoint representation of the Sp(r) group.
