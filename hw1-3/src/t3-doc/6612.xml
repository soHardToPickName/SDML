Trace anomaly for 4D higher derivative scalar-dilaton theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Trace anomaly for conformally invariant higher derivative 4D scalar-dilaton
theory is obtained by means of calculating divergent part of one-loop effective
action for such system. Its applications are briefly mentioned
