<title>
Quantum Field Theory with Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We explain that a bulk with arbitrary dimensions can be added to the space
over which a quantum field theory is defined. This gives a TQFT such that its
correlation functions in a slice are the same as those of the original quantum
field theory. This generalizes the stochastic quantization scheme, where the
bulk is one dimensional.
