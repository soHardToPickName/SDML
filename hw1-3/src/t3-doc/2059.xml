Bosonization as Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that bosonization in two dimensions can be derived as a special case
of the duality transformations that have recently been used to good effect in
string theory. This allows the construction of the bosonic counterpart of any
fermionic theory simply by `following your nose' using the standard duality
transformation rules. We work through the bosonization of the Dirac fermion,
the massive and massless Thirring models, and a fermion on a cylindrical
spacetime as illustrative examples.
