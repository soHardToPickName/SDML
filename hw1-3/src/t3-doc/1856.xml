Gauss Law Constraints in Chern-Simons Theory From BRST Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  The physical state condition in the BRST quantization of Chern-Simons field
theory is used to derive Gauss law constraints in the presence of Wilson loops,
which play an important role in explicitly establishing the connection of
Chern-Simons field theory with 2-dimensional conformal field theory.
