<title>
Generalized quantization scheme for central extensions of Lie algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the method for finding of the nonlinear Poisson-Lie groups
structures on the vector spaces and for their quantization. For arbitrary
central extension of Lie algebra explicit formulas of quantization are
proposed.
