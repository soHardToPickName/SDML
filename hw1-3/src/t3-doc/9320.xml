Superconformal and Super-BRS Invariance of the N = 1 Supersymmetric WZW
  Model Based on Lie Superalgebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the superconformal and super-BRS invariance of the supersymmetric
Wess-Zumino-Witten model based on Lie superalgebra. The computation of the
critical super-dimension of this model is done using the Fujikawa
regularization. Finally, we recover the well-known result which fixes the
relative coupling constant a2 = 1 in a rigorous way.
