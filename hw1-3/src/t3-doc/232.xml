Ultraviolet Property of Noncommutative Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct noncommutative extension of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model
and study its ultraviolet property. The \beta-function of the U(N)
noncommutative WZW model resembles that of the ordinary WZW model. The U(1)
noncommutative model has also a nontrivial fixed point.
