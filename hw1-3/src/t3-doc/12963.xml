<title>
Gravitationally dressed Parke-Taylor amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  A generating function for the Parke-Taylor amplitudes with any number of
positive helicity gravitons in addition to the positive helicity gluons is
obtained using the recently constructed self-dual classical solution of the
type of perturbiner in Yang-Mills theory interacting with gravity.
