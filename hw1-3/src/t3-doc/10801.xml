Free Equations for Massive Matter Fields in 2+1 Dimensional Anti-de
  Sitter Space From Deformed Oscillator Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We reformulate free equations of motion for massive spin 0 and spin 1/2
matter fields in 2+1 dimensional anti-de Sitter space in the form of some
covariant constantness conditions. The infinite-dimensional representation of
the anti-de Sitter algebra underlying this formulation is shown to admit a
natural realization in terms of the algebra of deformed oscillators with a
deformation parameter related to the parameter of mass.
