Reconstructing the Equation of State of Tachyon
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent progress in theoretical physics suggests that the dark energy in the
universe might be resulted from the rolling tachyon field of string theory.
Measurements to SNe Ia can be helpful to reconstruct the equation of state of
the rolling tachyon which is a possible candidate of dark energy. We present a
numerical analysis for the evolution of the equation of state of the rolling
tachyon and derive the reconstruction equations for the equation of state as
well as the potential.
