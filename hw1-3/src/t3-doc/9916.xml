Domain Walls from Anti-de Sitter Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine $(D-2)$-brane solutions in supergravities, showing that they fall
into four categories depending on the details of the dilaton coupling. In
general they describe domain walls, although in one of the four categories the
metric describes anti-de Sitter spacetime. We study this case, and its $S^1$
dimensional reduction to a more conventional domain wall in detail, focussing
in particular on the manner in which the unbroken supersymmetry of the anti-de
Sitter solution is partially broken by the dimensional reduction to the domain
wall.
