<title>
The Gauged (2,1) Heterotic Sigma-Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The geometry of (2,1) supersymmetric sigma-models with isometry symmetries is
discussed. The gauging of such symmetries in superspace is then studied. We
find that the coupling to the (2,1) Yang-Mills supermultiplet can be achieved
provided certain geometric conditions are satisfied. We construct the general
gauged action, using an auxiliary vector to generate the full non-polynomial
structure.
