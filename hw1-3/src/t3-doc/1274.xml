<title>
The Kazakov-Migdal Model as a High Temperature Lattice Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Kazakov-Migdal (K-M) induced gauge model in $d$ dimensions
describes the high temperature limit of ordinary lattice gauge theories in
$d+1$ dimensions. The matter fields are related to the Polyakov loops, while
the spatial gauge variables become the gauge fields of the K-M model. This
interpretation of the K-M model is in agreement with some recent results in
high temperature lattice QCD.
