Painleve III and 2D Polymers
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the scaling function of the dilute non-contractible self-avoiding 2D
polymer loop on a cylinder was related to the Painleve III transcendent. Using
the perturbation theory, the thermidynamic Bethe ansatz and numerical
calculations we argue a similar relation for the contractible self-avoiding
loop.
