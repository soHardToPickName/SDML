<title>
Towards an Effective Field Theory of QED
</title>

<abstract>
  A procedure for reducing the functional integral of QED to an integral over
bosonic gauge invariant fields is presented. Next, a certain averaging method
for this integral, giving a tractable effective quantum field theory, is
proposed. Finally, the current-current propagator and the chiral anomaly are
calculated within this new formulation. These results are part of our programme
of analyzing gauge theories with fermions in terms of local gauge invariants.
