<title>
A Noncommutative Version of the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply a (Moyal) deformation quantization to a bicomplex associated with
the classical nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This induces a deformation of the
latter equation to noncommutative space-time while preserving the existence of
an infinite set of conserved quantities.
