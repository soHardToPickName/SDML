Twisted Baryon Number in N=2 Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the baryon number of N=2 supersymmetric QCD can be twisted in
order to couple the topological field theory of non-abelian monopoles to
$Spin^c$-structures. To motivate the construction, we also consider some
aspects of the twisting procedure as a gauging of global currents in two and
four dimensions, in particular the role played by anomalies.
