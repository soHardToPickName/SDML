On the Strong CP Problem without Axion Field
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we present a topological observation related to the CP problem
in non-Abelian gauge theories, based on significant differences between
space-times and their Wick-rotation. We point out that models containing
stationary black holes the problem of CP breaking does not appear.
