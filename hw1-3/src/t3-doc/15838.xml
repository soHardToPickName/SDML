<title>
Stochastic Variational Approach to Minimum Uncertainty States
</title>

<abstract>
We introduce a new variational characterization of Gaussian diffusion processes
as minimum uncertainty states. We then define a variational method constrained
by kinematics of diffusions and Schr\"{o}dinger dynamics to seek states of
local minimum uncertainty for general non-harmonic potentials.
