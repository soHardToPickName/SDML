SD-brane gravity fields and rolling tachyons
</title>

<abstract>
  S(pacelike)D-branes are objects arising naturally in string theory when
Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed on the time direction. SD-brane
physics is inherently time-dependent. Previous investigations of gravity fields
of SD-branes have yielded undesirable naked spacelike singularities. We set up
the problem of coupling the most relevant open-string tachyonic mode to
massless closed-string modes in the bulk, with backreaction and Ramond-Ramond
fields included. We find solutions numerically in a self-consistent
approximation; our solutions are naturally asymptotically flat and
time-reversal asymmetric. We find completely nonsingular evolution; in
particular, the dilaton and curvature are well-behaved for all time. The
essential mechanism for spacetime singularity resolution is the inclusion of
full backreaction between the bulk fields and the rolling tachyon. Our analysis
is not the final word on the story, because we have to make some significant
approximations, most notably homogeneity of the tachyon on the unstable branes.
Nonetheless, we provide significant progress in plugging a gaping hole in prior
understanding of the gravity fields of SD-branes.
