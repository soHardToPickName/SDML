<title>
Exact Operator Solution of $A_2$-Toda Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum $A_2$-Toda field theory in two dimensions is investigated based on
the method of quantizing canonical free field. Toda exponential operators
associated with the fundamental weights are constructed to the fourth order in
the cosmological constant. This leads us to a conjecture for the exact operator
solution.
