<title>
Anti-de Sitter Fragmentation
</title>

<abstract>
  Some general aspects of the AdS_2/CFT_1 correspondence, previously discussed
in hep-th/9812073, are summarized. The majority of this summary is devoted to
the question of where the CFT_1 should live. Almost as a byproduct, the
decay---or fragmentation---of AdS_2 is also discussed.
