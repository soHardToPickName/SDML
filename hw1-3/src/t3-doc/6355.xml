A Comment on Fundamental Strings in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a solution of M(atrix) theory describing type IIA fundamental
string. Our construction is based on the central charge of the longitudinal
membrane (= fundamental string), the BPS saturation condition and the relation
between M(atrix) theory and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The fundamental
string corresponds to a photon in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
