Zeta Function Method for Repulsive Casimir Forces at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the Casimir energy between an unusual pair of parallel plates at
finite temperature, namely, a perfectely conducting plate ($\epsilon\to\infty$)
and an infinitely permeable one ($\mu\to\infty$) by applying the generalized
zeta function method. We also compute the Casimir pressure and discuss the high
and the low temperature limits.
