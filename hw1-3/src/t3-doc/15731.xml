<title>
Magnetic catalysis of parity breaking in a massive Gross-Neveu model and
  high-temperature superconductivity
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of a (2+1)-dimensional P-even massive Gross-Neveu model, an
external magnetic field is shown to induce a parity breaking first order phase
transition. Possibility of applying the results obtained to description of
magnetic phase transitions in high-temperature superconductors is discussed.
