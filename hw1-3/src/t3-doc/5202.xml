<title>
The $\nu \nu \gamma$ Amplitude in an External Homogeneous
  Electromagnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  Neutrino-photon interactions in the presence of an external homogeneous
constant electromagnetic field are studied. The $\nu \nu \gamma $ amplitude is
calculated in an electromagnetic field of the general type, when the two field
invariants are nonzero.
