<title>
Bicovariant differential calculus on quantum groups from Poisson Lie
  structures
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical explanation of the notion of
a Poisson Lie structure on the external algebra of a Poisson Lie group which
was introduced in our previous papers. Using this notion as a guide we
construct quantum external algebras on $SL_q(N)$ with proper (classical)
dimension.
