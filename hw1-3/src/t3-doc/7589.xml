Computing the spectrum of black hole radiation in the presence of high
  frequency dispersion: an analytical approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a method for computing the spectrum of black hole radiation of a
scalar field satisfying a wave equation with high frequency dispersion. The
method involves a combination of Laplace transform and WKB techniques for
finding approximate solutions to ordinary differential equations. The modified
wave equation is obtained by adding a higher order derivative term suppressed
by powers of a fundamental momentum scale $k_0$ to the ordinary wave equation.
Depending on the sign of this new term, high frequency modes propagate either
superluminally or subluminally. We show that the resulting spectrum of created
particles is thermal at the Hawking temperature, and further that the out-state
is a thermal state at the Hawking temperature, to leading order in $k_0$, for
either modification.
