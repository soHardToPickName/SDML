<title>
The Stretched Horizon and Black Hole Complementarity
</title>

<abstract>
  Three postulates asserting the validity of conventional quantum theory,
semi-classical general relativity and the statistical basis for thermodynamics
are introduced as a foundation for the study of black hole evolution. We
explain how these postulates may be implemented in a ``stretched horizon'' or
membrane description of the black hole, appropriate to a distant observer. The
technical analysis is illustrated in the simplified context of 1+1 dimensional
dilaton gravity. Our postulates imply that the dissipative properties of the
stretched horizon arise from a course graining of microphysical degrees of
freedom that the horizon must possess. A principle of black hole
complementarity is advocated. The overall viewpoint is similar to that
pioneered by 't~Hooft but the detailed implementation is different.
