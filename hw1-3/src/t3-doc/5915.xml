<title>
Open superstring partition function in constant gauge field background
  at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the general expression for the open superstring partition function on
the annulus in a constant abelian gauge field background and at finite
temperature. We use the approach based on Green-Schwarz string path integral in
the light-cone gauge and compare it with NSR approach. We discuss the super
Yang-Mills theory limit and mention some D-brane applications.
