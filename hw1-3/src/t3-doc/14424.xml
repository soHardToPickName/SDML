Duality of Super D-brane Actions in General Type IIB Supergravity
  Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine duality transformations of supersymmetric and $\kappa$-symmetric
Dp-brane actions in a general type II supergravity background where in
particular the dilaton and the axion are supposed to not be zero or a constant
but a general superfield. Due to non-constant dilaton and axion, we can
explicitly show that the dilaton and the axion as well as the two 2-form gauge
potentials transform as doublets under the $SL(2,R)$ transformation from the
point of view of the world-volume field theory.
