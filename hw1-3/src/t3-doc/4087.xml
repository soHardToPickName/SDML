Automorphism Modular Invariants of Current Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider those two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs)
whose chiral algebras, when maximally extended, are isomorphic to the current
algebra formed from some affine non-twisted Kac--Moody algebra at fixed level.
In this case the partition function is specified by an automorphism of the
fusion ring and corresponding symmetry of the Kac--Peterson modular matrices.
We classify all such partition functions when the underlying finite-dimensional
Lie algebra is simple. This gives all possible spectra for this class of RCFTs.
While accomplishing this, we also find the primary fields with second smallest
quantum dimension.
