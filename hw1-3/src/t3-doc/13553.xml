<title>
Magnetic Catalysis of Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-perturbative effect of the formation of a chiral symmetry breaking
condensate <\bar\psi\psi> and of a dynamically generated fermion mass in QED in
the presence of an external magnetic field is considered. The dynamical mass of
a fermion (energy gap in the fermion spectrum) is shown to depend essentially
nonanalytically on the renormalized coupling constant \alpha in a strong
magnetic field. Possible applications of this effect are discussed.
