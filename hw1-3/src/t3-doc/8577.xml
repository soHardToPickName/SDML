<title>
Duality-Symmetric Three-Brane and its Coupling to Type IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the bosonic sector of the M-theory super-five-brane we obtain
the action for duality-symmetric three-brane and construct the consistent
coupling of the proposed action with the bosonic sector of type IIB
supergravity.
