<title>
A Generalization of the Submodel of Nonlinear CP^1 Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the submodel of nonlinear CP^1 models. The generalized models
include higher order derivatives. For the systems of higher order equations, we
construct a B\"acklund-like transformation of solutions and an infinite number
of conserved currents by using the Bell polynomials.
