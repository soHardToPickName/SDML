<title>
Conformal N=0 d=4 Gauge Theories from AdS/CFT Superstring Duality?
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-supersymmetric d=4 gauge theories which arise from superstring duality on
a manifold $AdS_5 \times S_5/Z_p$ are cataloged for a range $2 \leq p \leq 41$.
A number have vanishing two-loop gauge \beta-function, a necessary but not
sufficient condition to be a conformal field theory.
