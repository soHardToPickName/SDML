<title>
The vortex oscillations in Abelian Higgs model
</title>

<abstract>
  The excitations of the vortex in Abelian Higgs model with small ratio of
vector and Higgs particle masses are considered. Three main modes encountered
in numerical computations are described in detail. They are also compared to
analytic results obtained recently by Arodz and Hadasz.
