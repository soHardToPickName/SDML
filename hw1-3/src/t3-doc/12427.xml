Vanishing Next-to-Leading Corrections to the \beta-Function of the SUSY
  CP^{N-1} Model in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the ultraviolet properties of the supersymmetric CP^{N-1} sigma
model in three dimensions to next-to-leading order in the 1/N expansion. We
calculate the \beta-function to this order and verify that it has no
next-to-leading order corrections.
