<title>
Duality Induced Reflections and CPT
</title>

<abstract>
  The linear particle-antiparticle conjugation $\ty C$ and position space
reflection $\ty P$ as well as the antilinear time reflection $\ty T$ are shown
to be inducable by the selfduality of representations for the operation groups
$\SU(2)$, $\SL(\C^2)$ and $\R$ for spin, Lorentz transformations and time
translations resp. The definition of a colour compatible linear
$\ty{CP}$-reflection for quarks as selfduality induced is impossible since
triplet and antitriplet $\SU(3)$-representations are not linearly equivalent.
