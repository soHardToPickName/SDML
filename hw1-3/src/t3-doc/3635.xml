<title>
Nonperturbative solution of supersymmetric gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent work on the numerical solution of supersymmetric gauge theories is
described. The method used is SDLCQ (supersymmetric discrete light-cone
quantization). An application to N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in 2+1
dimensions at large N_c is summarized. The addition of a Chern-Simons term is
also discussed.
