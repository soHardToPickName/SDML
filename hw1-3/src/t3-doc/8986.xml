Thermalization and Lyapunov Exponents in the Yang-Mills-Higgs Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate thermalization processes occurring at different time scales in
the Yang-Mills-Higgs system at high temperatures. We determine the largest
Lyapunov exponent associated with the gauge fields and verify its relation to
the perturbatively calculated damping rate of a static gauge boson.
