One-loop Conformal Anomalies From AdS/CFT in the Schrodinger
  Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the conformal anomalies of boundary CFTs for scalar and fermionic
fields propagating in AdS spacetime at one-loop. The coefficients are
quantized, with values related to the mass-spectra for Kaluza-Klein
compactifications of Supergravity on AdS5xS5 and AdS7xS4. Our approach
interprets the boundary partition function of fields propagating on AdS
spacetime in terms of wave-functionals that satisfy the functional Schrodinger
equation.
