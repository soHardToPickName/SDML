<title>
A modification of the 10d superparticle action inspired by the
  Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme method
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the issue of the existence of a complex structure in the
Gupta-Bleuler quantization scheme. We prove an existence theorem for the
complex structure associated with the $d=10$ Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz
superparticle, based on an explicitly constructed Lagrangian that allows a
holomorphic-antiholomorphic splitting of the fermionic constraints consistent
with the vanishing of all first class constraints on the physical states.
