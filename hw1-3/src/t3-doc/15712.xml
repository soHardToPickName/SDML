From ALE-instanton Moduli to Super Yang-Mills Theories via Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A large class of equivalence relations between the moduli spaces of
instantons on ALE spaces and the Higgs branches of supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theories, are found by means of a certain kind of duality transformation
between brane configurations in superstring theories. 4d, N=2 and 5d, N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories with product gauge groups turn out to correspond
to the ALE-instanton moduli of type II B and type II A superstring theories,
respectively.
