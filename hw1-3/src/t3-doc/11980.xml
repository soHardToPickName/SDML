<title>
Stringy gravity, interacting tensionless strings and massless higher
  spins
</title>

<abstract>
  Consequences of a strong version of the AdS/CFT correspondence for extremely
stringy physics are examined. In particular, properties of N = 4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory are used to extract results about interacting tensionless
strings and massless higher spin fields in an AdS_5 x S^5 background.
Furthermore, the thermodynamics of this model signals the presence of a
Hawking-Page phase transition between AdS_5 space and a "black hole"-like high
temperature configuration even in the extreme string limit.
