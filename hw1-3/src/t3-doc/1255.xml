<title>
A Non-Perturbative Superpotential With $E_8$ Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the non-perturbative superpotential in $F$-theory compactification
to four dimensions on a complex three-fold $\P^1\times S$, where $S$ is a
rational elliptic surface. In contrast to examples considered previously, the
superpotential in this case has interesting modular properties; it is
essentially an $E_8$ theta function.
