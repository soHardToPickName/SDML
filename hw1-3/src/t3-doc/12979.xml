<title>
N=1 supersymmetric sigma model with boundaries, I
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an N=1 two-dimensional non-linear sigma model with boundaries
representing, e.g., a gauge fixed open string. We describe the full set of
boundary conditions compatible with N=1 superconformal symmetry. The problem is
analyzed in two different ways: by studying requirements for invariance of the
action, and by studying the conserved supercurrent. We present the target space
interpretation of these results, and identify the appearance of partially
integrable almost product structures.
