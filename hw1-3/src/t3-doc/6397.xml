Bouncing Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Two classical scalar fields are minimally coupled to gravity in the
Kachru-Shulz-Silverstein scenario with a rolling fifth radius. A Tolman
wormhole solution is found for a R x S^3 brane with Lorentz metric and for a R
x AdS_3 brane with positive definite metric.
