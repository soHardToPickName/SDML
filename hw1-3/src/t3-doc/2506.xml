A note on twist two operators in N=4 SYM and Wilson loops in Minkowski
  signature
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the anomalous dimension of twist two operators in N=4 SYM theory was
computed by Gubser, Klebanov and Polyakov in the limit of large 't Hooft
coupling using semi-classical rotating strings in AdS_5. Here we reproduce
their results for large angular momentum by using the cusp anomaly of Wilson
loops in Minkowski signature also computed within the AdS/CFT correspondence.
In this case the anomalous dimension is related to an Euclidean worldsheet
whose properties are completely determined by the symmetries of the problem.
This gives support to the proposed identification of rotating strings and twist
two operators.
