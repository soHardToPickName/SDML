Normalized Weyl-type $\star$-product on K\"ahler manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a normalized Weyl-type $\star$-product on general K\"{a}hler
manifolds. Expanding this product perturbatively we show that the cumbersome
term, which appears in a Berezin-type product, does not appear at least in the
first order of $\hbar$. This means a normalization factor, which is introduced
by Reshetikhin and Takhtajan for a Berezin-type product, is unnecessary for our
Weyl-type product at that order.
