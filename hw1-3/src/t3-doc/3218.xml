<title>
The Spectral Dimension of 2D Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the spectral dimension d_s of two-dimensional quantum gravity
coupled to Gaussian fields is two for all values of the central charge c <= 1.
The same arguments provide a simple proof of the known result d_s= 4/3 for
branched polymers.
