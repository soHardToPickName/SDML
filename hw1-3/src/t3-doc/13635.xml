From CFT's to Graphs
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we pursue the discussion of the connections between rational
conformal field theories (CFT) and graphs. We generalize our recent work on the
relations of operator product algebra (OPA) structure constants of $sl(2)\,$
theories with the Pasquier algebra attached to the graph. We show that in a
variety of CFT built on $sl(n)\,$ -- typically conformal embeddings and
orbifolds, similar considerations enable one to write a linear system satisfied
by the matrix elements of the Pasquier algebra in terms of conformal data --
quantum dimensions and fusion coefficients. In some cases, this provides a
sufficient information for the determination of all the eigenvectors of an
adjacency matrix, and hence of a graph.
