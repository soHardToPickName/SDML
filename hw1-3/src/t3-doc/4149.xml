<title>
Five-Dimensional BF Theory and Four-Dimensional Current Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the relation between the five-dimensional BF model and a
four-dimensional local current algebra from the point of view of perturbative
local quantum field theory. We use an axial gauge fixing procedure and show
that it allows for a well defined theory which actually can be solved exactly.
