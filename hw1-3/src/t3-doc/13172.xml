Completing the Square to Find the Supersymmetric Matter Effective Action
  Induced by Coupling to Linearized N=1 Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider generic N=1 supersymmetric matter coupled to linearized N=1
supergravity through the multiplet of currents. By completing the square, we
find the effective action giving the leading supergravity induced correction to
the matter dynamics, expressed explicitly as a quadratic form in the components
of the current multiplet. The effective action is supersymmetry invariant
through an interplay of the local terms arising from the auxiliary field
couplings, and the nonlocal terms arising from graviton and gravitino exchange,
neither of which is separately invariant. Having an explicit form for the
supergravity induced effective action is a first step in studying whether
supergravity corrections can lead to dynamical supersymmetry breaking in
supersymmetric matter dynamics. In Appendices we give explicit expressions for
the currents, in our notational conventions, in the Wess-Zumino and
supersymmetric Yang Mills models.
