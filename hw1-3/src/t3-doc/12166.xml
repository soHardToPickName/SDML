<title>
Hamiltonian reduction of the $U_{EM}(1)$ gauged three flavour WZW model
</title>

<abstract>
  The three-flavour Wess-Zumino model coupled to electromagnetism is treated as
a constraint system using the Faddeev-Jackiw method. Expanding into series of
powers of the Goldstone boson fields and keeping terms up to second and third
order we obtain Coulomb-gauge hamiltonian densities.
