Algebraic Renormalization of Parity-Preserving QED_3 Coupled to
  Scalar Matter II: Broken Case
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter the algebraic renormalization method, which is independent
of any kind of regularization scheme, is presented for the parity-preserving
QED_3 coupled to scalar matter in the broken regime, where the scalar assumes
a finite vacuum expectation value, $<\vf> = v$. The model shows to be stable
under radiative corrections and anomaly free.
