<title>
Chiral Poincare transformations and their anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  I consider global transformations of a Dirac fermion field, that are
generated by the generators of Poincar'e transformations, but with a \gamma_5
appended. Such chiral translations and chiral Lorentz transformations are
usually not symmetries of the Lagrangian, but naively they are symmetries of
the fermionic measure. However, by using proper time regularization in
Minkowski space, I find that they in general give rise to a nontrivial
Jacobian. In this sense they have "anomalies". I calculate these anomalies in a
theory of a massive fermion coupled to an external Abelian vector field. My
motivation for considering chiral Poincar'e transformations is the possibility
that they are relevant to bosonization in four dimensions.
