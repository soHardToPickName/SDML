The Classification of Affine SU(3) Modular Invariant Partition Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  A complete classification of the WZNW modular invariant partition functions
is known for very few affine algebras and levels, the most significant being
all levels of SU(2), and level 1 of all simple algebras. In this paper we solve
the classification problem for SU(3) modular invariant partition functions. Our
approach will also be applicable to other affine Lie algebras, and we include
some preliminary work in that direction, including a sketch of a new proof for
SU(2).
