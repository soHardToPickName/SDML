<title>
Meaning of Noncommutative Geometry and the Planck-Scale Quantum Group
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an introduction for nonspecialists to the noncommutative geometric
approach to Planck scale physics coming out of quantum groups. The canonical
role of the `Planck scale quantum group' $C[x]\bicross C[p]$ and its
observable-state T-duality-like properties are explained. The general meaning
of noncommutativity of position space as potentially a new force in Nature is
explained as equivalent under quantum group Fourier transform to curvature in
momentum space. More general quantum groups $C(G^\star)\bicross U(g)$ and
$U_q(g)$ are also discussed. Finally, the generalisation from quantum groups to
general quantum Riemannian geometry is outlined. The semiclassical limit of the
latter is a theory with generalised non-symmetric metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ obeying
$\nabla_\mu g_{\nu\rho}-\nabla_\nu g_{\mu\rho}=0$
