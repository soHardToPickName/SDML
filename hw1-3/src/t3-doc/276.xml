Jack polynomials in superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  This work initiates the study of {\it orthogonal} symmetric polynomials in
superspace. Here we present two approaches leading to a family of orthogonal
polynomials in superspace that generalize the Jack polynomials. The first
approach relies on previous work by the authors in which eigenfunctions of the
supersymmetric extension of the trigonometric Calogero-Moser-Sutherland
Hamiltonian were constructed. Orthogonal eigenfunctions are now obtained by
diagonalizing the first nontrivial element of a bosonic tower of commuting
conserved charges not containing this Hamiltonian. Quite remarkably, the
expansion coefficients of these orthogonal eigenfunctions in the supermonomial
basis are stable with respect to the number of variables. The second and more
direct approach amounts to symmetrize products of non-symmetric Jack
polynomials with monomials in the fermionic variables. This time, the
orthogonality is inherited from the orthogonality of the non-symmetric Jack
polynomials, and the value of the norm is given explicitly.
