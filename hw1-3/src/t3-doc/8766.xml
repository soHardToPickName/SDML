One-Loop Renormalization in Two-Dimensional Matter-Dilaton Quantum
  Gravity and Charged Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum properties of two-dimensional matter-dilaton gravity
  ---which includes a large family of actions for two-dimensional gravity (in
particular, string-inspired models)--- are investigated. The one-loop
divergences in linear covariant gauges are calculated and the structure of the
one-loop renormalization is studied. The explicit forms of the dilaton
potential, dilaton-Maxwell, and dilaton-scalar couplings for which the theory
is one-loop multiplicatively renormalizable are found.
  A comparison with the one-loop renormalization structure of four-dimensional
gravity-matter theory is given. Charged multiple-horizon black holes which
appear in the model are also considered.
