Black holes and exact solutions in string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some recent results about exact classical solutions in string
theory. In particular, we consider four dimensional extremal electric black
holes which are related via dimensional reduction to the exact five dimensional
fundamental string solutions. We also comment on the issue of \a' corrections
to non-extremal black holes. (To appear in Proceedings of the Conference on
Current Topics in Astrofundamental Physics, September 1994, Erice)
