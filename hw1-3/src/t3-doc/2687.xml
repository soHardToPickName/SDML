<title>
Comment on the Bound State Problem in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We re-examine the threshold bound state problem on the wrong sign Taub-Nut
space; the metric on which describes the relative moduli space of well
separated BPS monopoles. The quantum mechanics gives rise to a continuous
family of threshold bound states, in distinction to the unique one found on the
Atiyah-Hitchin metric.
