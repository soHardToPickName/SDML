Technical Remarks and Comments on the UV/IR-Mixing Problem of a
  Noncommutative Scalar Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we will dicuss the possibility of a resummation procedure in
order to cure the UV/IR-mixing problem of noncommutative field theories. The
method is presented for a scalar phi^4 theory on Euclidean space. Finally, we
sketch the idea of resummation for U(1)-gauge theories.
