<title>
Exotic Gauge Theories from Tensor Calculus
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct non-standard interactions between exterior form gauge fields by
gauging a particular global symmetry of the Einstein-Maxwell action for such
fields. Furthermore we discuss generalizations of such interactions by adding
couplings to gravitational Chern-Simons forms and to fields arising through
dimensional reduction. The construction uses an appropriate tensor calculus.
