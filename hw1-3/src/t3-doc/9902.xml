On Eigenvalue Decompactification in QCD$_{1+1} $
</title>

<abstract>
  The question whether it is necessary to decompactify the gauge eigenvalue
degrees of freedom in QCD$_{1+1} $ is addressed. A careful consideration of the
dynamics governing these degrees of freedom leads to the conclusion that
eigenvalue decompactification is not necessary due to the curvature on the
space of eigenvalues.
