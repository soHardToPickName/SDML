Energy Computation in Wormhole Background with the Wheeler-DeWitt
  Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility of computing energy by means of operators
associated to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. By choosing three dimensional
wormholes as a framework, we apply such calculation scheme to the black hole
pair creation. We compare our results with the recent ones appeared in the
literature.
