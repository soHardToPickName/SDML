The Spectrum of the Neumann Matrix with Zero Modes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the spectrum of the matrix M' of Neumann coefficients of the
Witten vertex, expressed in the oscillator basis including the zero-mode a_0.
We find that in addition to the known continuous spectrum inside [-1/3,0) of
the matrix M without the zero-modes, there is also an additional eigenvalue
inside (0,1). For every eigenvalue, there is a pair of eigenvectors, a
twist-even and a twist-odd. We give analytically these eigenvectors as well as
the generating function for their components. Also, we have found an
interesting critical parameter b_0 = 8 ln 2 on which the forms of the
eigenvectors depend.
