<title>
Antifield Dependence of Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that generally the consistency equation for anomalies of quantum
field theories has solutions which depend nontrivially on the sources of the
(generalized) BRS-transformations of the fields. Explicit previously unknown
examples of such solutions are given for Yang-Mills and super Yang-Mills
theories.
