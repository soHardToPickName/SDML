<title>
Integrable System Constructed out of Two Interacting Superconformal
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe how it is possible to introduce the interaction between
superconformal fields of the same conformal dimensions. In the classical case
such construction can be used to the construction of the Hirota - Satsuma
equation. We construct supersymmetric Poisson tensor for such fields, which
generates a new class of Hamiltonin systems. We found Lax representation for
one of equation in this class by supersymmetrization Lax operator responsible
for Hirota - Satsuma equation. Interestingly our supersymmetric equation is not
reducible to classical Hirota - Satsuma equation. We show that our generalized
system is reduced to the one of the supersymmetric KDV equation (a=4) but in
this limit integrals of motion are not reduced to integrals of motion of the
supersymmetric KdV equation.
