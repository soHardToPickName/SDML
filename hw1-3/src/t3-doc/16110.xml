Constraints on Low-Dimensional String Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the restrictions imposed by cancellation of the tadpoles for two,
three, and four-form gauge fields in string theory, M-theory and F-theory
compactified to two, three and four dimensions, respectively. For a large class
of supersymmetric vacua, turning on a sufficient number of strings, membranes
and three-branes, respectively, can cancel the tadpoles, and preserve
supersymmetry. However, there are cases where the tadpole cannot be removed in
this way, either because the tadpole is fractional, or because of its sign. For
M-theory and F-theory compactifications, we also explore the relation of the
membranes and three-branes to the nonperturbative space-time superpotential.
