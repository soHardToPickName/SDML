Remarks on supersymmetric effective actions and supersymmetry breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some issues related to the definition of different effective
actions, in connection with the work on supersymmetric theories by Seiberg and
collaborators. We also comment on the possibility of extending this work to
broken supersymmetric theories.
