Spacetime torsion and parity violation: a gauge invariant formulation
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of parity violation through spacetime torsion has been
explored in a scenario containing fields with different spins. Taking the
Kalb-Ramond field as the source of torsion, an explicitly parity violating
$U(1)_{EM}$ gauge invariant theory has been constructed by extending the KR
field with a Chern-Simons term.
