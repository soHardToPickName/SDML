<title>
On the geometry of the Hawking Turok instanton
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the coordinate complexification necessary to obtain a spatially
homogeneous open universe in the singular instantonic solution recently
suggested by Hawking and Turok (hep-th/9802030), concluding that only the
time coordinate $\sigma$ of the spatially inhomogeneous De Sitter-like
Lorentzian solution and its scale factor should be rotated in order to
continue into a Lorentzian open universe.
