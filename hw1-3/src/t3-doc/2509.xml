<title>
A Curious Relation Between Gravity and Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We find that Euclidian or Minkowski gravity in d dimensions can be formally
expressed as the restriction to a slice of a supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory
in d+1 dimensions with SO(d+1), SO(d,1) or SO(d-1,2) internal symmetry. We
suggest that renormalization effects in the bulk imply a contraction of the
latter symmetry into the Poincare group ISO(d) or ISO(d-1,1).
