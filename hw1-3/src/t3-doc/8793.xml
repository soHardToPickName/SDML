T-Duality in Sigma Models with Kaluza-Klein Metric as Electric-Magnetic
  Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the T-duality in \sigma-model with Kaluza-Klein metric,
without or with a torsion term, can be interpreted as electric-magnetic duality
for some of their solitonic solutions. Actually Buscher's duality
transformation interchanges the topological and Noether charges.
