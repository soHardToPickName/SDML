Covariant Actions for the Bosonic Sector of D=10 IIB Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Covariant actions for the bosonic fields of D=10 IIB supergravity are
constructed with the help of a single auxiliary scalar field and in a
formulation with an infinite series of auxiliary (anti)-self-dual 5-form
fields.
