SU(3)X SU(2)XU(1) Chiral Models from Intersecting D4-/D5-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify RR tadpole cancellation conditions for intersecting D4-/D5-branes.
We find all of the D4-brane models which have D=4 three-generation chiral
fermions with the SU(3)XSU(2)XU(1)^n symmetries. For the D5-brane case, we
present a solution to the conditions which gives exactly the matter contents of
standard model with U(1) anomalies.
