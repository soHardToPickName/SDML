<title>
BFFT quantization and dynamical solutions of a fluid field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a field theory formulation of a fluid mechanical model. We implement
the Hamiltonian formalism by using the BFFT conjecture in order to build a
gauge invariant fluid field theory. We also generalize previous known classical
dynamical field solutions for the fluid model.
