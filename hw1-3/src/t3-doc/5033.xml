<title>
D-branes in a topologically nontrivial B-field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study global worldsheet anomalies for open strings ending on several
coincident D-branes in the presence of a B-field. We show that cancellation of
anomalies is made possible by a correlation between the t'Hooft magnetic flux
on the D-branes and the topological class of the B-field. One application of
our results is a proper understanding of the geometric nature of the gauge
field living on D-branes: rather than being a connection on a vector bundle, it
is a connection on a module over a certain noncommutative algebra. Our argument
works for a general closed string background. We also explain why in the
presence of a topologically nontrivial B-field whose curvature is pure torsion
D-branes represent classes in a twisted K-theory, as conjectured by E. Witten.
