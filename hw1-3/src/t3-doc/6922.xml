Dyonic Instantons in Five Dimensional Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that there exist finite energy, non-singular instanton solutions for
five-dimensional theories with broken gauge symmetry. The soliton is supported
against collapse by a non-zero electric charge. The low-energy dynamics of
these solutions is described by motion on the ADHM moduli space with potential.
