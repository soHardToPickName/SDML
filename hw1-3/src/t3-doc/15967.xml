<title>
Microscopic Entropy of N=2 Extremal Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory is used to compute the microscopic entropy for several examples
of black holes in compactifications with $N=2$ supersymmetry. Agreement with
the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and the moduli-independent $N=2$ area formula is
found in all cases.
