<title>
High Energy Asymptotics of Multi--Colour QCD and Exactly Solvable
  Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum inverse scattering method is applied to the solution of equations
for wave functions of compound states of $n$ reggeized gluons in the
multicolour QCD in a generalized leading logarithmic approximation.
