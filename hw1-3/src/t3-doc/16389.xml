String Creation and Monodromy from Fractional D-branes on ALE spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the anomalous creation of fundamental strings using the
boundary state formalism of fractional D-branes on ALE spaces in the orbifold
limit. The open string Witten index plays a crucial role in this calculation
and so the result remains unchanged even if we blow up the orbifold
geometrically, matching the anomaly inflow argument. Further we consider the
quiver gauge theories on such fractional D3-branes and see that the string
creation mechanism determines 1-loop logarithmic monodromy of these gauge
theories. Also we comment on the relation of D(-1)-D3 amplitude to the 1-loop
beta function.
