Supergravity M5-branes wrapped on Riemann surfaces and their QFT duals
</title>

<abstract>
  We find solutions of 11-dimensional supergravity for M5-branes wrapped on
Riemann surfaces. These solutions preserve ${\cal N} = 2$ four-dimensional
supersymmetry. They are dual to ${\cal N} = 2$ gauge theories, including
non-conformal field theories. We work out the case of ${\cal N} = 2$ Yang-Mills
in detail.
