Dressing Transformations and the Algebraic--Geometrical Solutions in the
  Conformal Affine $sl(2)$ Toda Model
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the algebraic--geometrical (or quasiperiodic) solutions of
the Conformal Affine $sl(2)$ Toda model are generated from the vacuum via
dressing transformations. This result generalizes the result of Babelon and
Bernard which states that the $N$--soliton solutions are generated from the
vacuum by dressing transformations.
