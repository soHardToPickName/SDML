<title>
Another Leigh-Strassler deformation through the Matrix model
</title>

<abstract>
  In here the matrix model approach, by Dijkgraaf and Vafa, is used in order to
obtain the effective superpotential for a certain deformation of N=4 SYM
discovered by Leigh and Strassler. An exact solution to the matrix model
Lagrangian is found and is expressed in terms of elliptic functions.
