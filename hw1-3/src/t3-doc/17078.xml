Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten Models Based on Lie Superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The affine current algebra for Lie superalgebras is examined. The bilinear
invariant forms of the Lie superalgebra can be either degenerate or
non-degenerate. We give the conditions for a Virasoro construction, in which
the currents are primary fields of weight one, to exist. In certain cases, the
Virasoro central charge is an integer equal to the super dimension of the group
supermanifold. A Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten action based on these Lie
superalgebras is also found.
