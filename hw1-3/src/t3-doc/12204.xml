<title>
Strings And Non-Topological Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We have numerically calculated topological andnon-topological solitons in two
spatial dimensions with Chern-Simons term. Their quantum stability, as well as
that of the Maxwell vortex, is analyzed by means of bounce instantons which
involve three-dimensional strings and non-topological solitons.
