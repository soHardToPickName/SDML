<title>
The Ring Division Self Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple construction of the instantonic type equation over
octonions where its similarities and differences with the quaternionic case are
very clear. We use the unified language of Clifford Algebra. We argue that our
approach is the pure algebraic formulation of the geometric based soft Lie
algebra. The topological criteria for the stability of our solution is given
explicitly to establish its solitonic property. Many beautiful features of the
parallelizable ring division spheres and Absolute Parallelism (AP) reveal their
presence in our formulation.
