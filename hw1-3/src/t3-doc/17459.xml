Moyal Brackets, Star Products and the Generalised Wigner Function
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wigner-Weyl- Moyal approach to Quantum Mechanics is recalled, and
similarities to classical probability theory emphasised. The Wigner
distribution function is generalised and viewed as a construction of a bosonic
object, a target space co-ordinate, for example, in terms of a bilinear
convolution of two fermionic objects, e.g. a quark antiquark pair. This
construction is essentially non-local, generalising the idea of a local
current. Such Wigner functions are shown to solve a BPS generalised Moyal-Nahm
equation.
