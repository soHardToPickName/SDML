<title>
Derivative expansion of quadratic operators in a general 't Hooft gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  A derivative expansion technique is developed to compute functional
determinants of quadratic operators, non diagonal in spacetime indices. This
kind of operators arise in general 't Hooft gauge fixed Lagrangians. Elaborate
applications of the developed derivative expansion are presented.
