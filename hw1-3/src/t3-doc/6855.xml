<title>
The zero-curvature representation for nonlinear O(3) sigma-model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider O(3) sigma-model as a reduction of the principal chiral field.
This approach allows to introduce the currents with ultralocal
  Poisson brackets and to obtain the zero-curvature equation which admits the
fundamental Poisson bracket.
