<title>
On dimensional regularization of sums
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a systematic way to dimensionally regularize divergent sums
arising in field theories with an arbitrary number of physical compact
dimensions or finite temperature. The method preserves the same symmetries of
the action as the conventional dimensional regularization and allows an easy
separation of the regulated divergence from the finite term that depends on the
compactification radius (temperature).
