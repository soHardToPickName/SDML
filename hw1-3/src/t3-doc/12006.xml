<title>
N=2 symplectic reparametrizations in a chiral background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the symplectic reparametrizations that are possible for theories of
N=2 supersymmetric vector multiplets in the presence of a chiral background and
discuss some of their consequences. One of them concerns an anomaly arising
from a conflict between symplectic covariance and holomorphy.
