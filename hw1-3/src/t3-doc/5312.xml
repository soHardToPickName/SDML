<title>
Wilsonian vs. 1PI renormalization group flow irreversibility
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a line of reasoning based on the analysis of scale variations of
the Wilsonian partition function and the trace of the stress tensor in a curved
manifold which results in a statement of irreversibility of Wilsonian
renormalization group flow for unitary theories. We also analyze subtleties
related to subtractions in the case of the 1PI effective action flow.
