Density Correlation Functions in Calogero Sutherland Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Using arguments from two dimensional Yang-Mills theory and the collective
coordinate formulation of the Calogero-Sutherland model, we conjecture the
dynamical density correlation function for coupling $l$ and $1/l$, where $l$ is
an integer. We present overwhelming evidence that the conjecture is indeed
correct.
