Condensates near the Argyres-Douglas point in SU(2) gauge theory with
  broken N=2 supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The behaviour of the chiral condensates in the SU(2) gauge theory with broken
N=2 supersymmetry is reviewed. The calculation of monopole, dyon, and charge
condensates is described. It is shown that the monopole and charge condensates
vanish at the Argyres-Douglas point where the monopole and charge vacua
collide. This phenomenon is interpreted as a deconfinement of electric and
magnetic charges at the Argyres-Douglas point.
