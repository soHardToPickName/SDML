Canonical Quantization and Topological Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical quantization of the topological particle is described; it is
shown that BRST quantization of the model gives the supersymmetric quantum
mechanical model considered by Witten when investigating Morse theory, and the
rigorous path integral method appropriate for this model is discussed.
Possibilities for the extension of this work to two dimensional models are
briefly considered.
