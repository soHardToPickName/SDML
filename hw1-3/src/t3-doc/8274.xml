Racah Sum Rule and Biedenharn-Elliott Identity for the Super-Rotation
  $6-j$ symbols
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the well known Racah sum rule and Biedenharn-Elliott
identity satisfied by the recoupling coefficients or by the $6-j$ symbols of
the usual rotation $SO(3)$ algebra can be extended to the corresponding
features of the super-rotation $osp(1|2)$ superalgebra. The structure of the
sum rules is completely similar in both cases, the only difference concerns the
signs which are more involved in the super-rotation case.
