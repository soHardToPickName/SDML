<title>
Translocality and a Duality Principle in Generally Covariant Quantum
  Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the formal rules of correspondence between local
observation procedures and observables do not exhaust the entire physical
content of generally covariant quantum field theory. This result is obtained by
expressing the distinguishing features of the local kinematical structure of
quantum field theory in the generally covariant context in terms of a
translocal structure which carries the totality of the nonlocal kinematical
informations in a local region. This gives rise to a duality principle at the
dynamical level which emphasizes the significance of the underlying translocal
structure for modelling a minimal algebra around a given point. We discuss the
emergence of classical properties from this point of view.
