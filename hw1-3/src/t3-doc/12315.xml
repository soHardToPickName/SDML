<title>
Perturbation Theory with a Variational Basis: the Generalized Gaussian
  Effective Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  The perturbation theory with a variational basis is constructed and
analyzed.The generalized Gaussian effective potential is introduced and
evaluated up to the second order for selfinteracting scalar fields in one and
two spatial dimensions. The problem of the renormalization of the mass is
discussed in details. Thermal corrections are incorporated. The comparison
between the finite temperature generalized Gaussian effective potential and the
finite temperature effective potential is critically analyzed. The phenomenon
of the restoration at high temperature of the symmetry broken at zero
temperature is discussed.
