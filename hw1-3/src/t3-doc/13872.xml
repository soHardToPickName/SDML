Finite Size Formula in the XYZ Spin Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  The XYZ spin chain with boundaries is studied. We construct the vacuum state
by the vertex operators in the level one modules of the elliptic algebra, and
compact it through a geometric symmetry of the model called the turning
symmetry. From this simplified expression the ``finite size formula'' for
magnetizations in the bounded and in the half-infinite chains is deduced.
Applying this formula we calculate the spontaneous magnetization in the bounded
XYZ model.
