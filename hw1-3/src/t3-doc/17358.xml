Axial Currents in Electrodynamics P.C.R
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present work we argue that the usual assumption that magnetic currents
possess the vector structure characteristic of electric currents may be the
source of several difficulties in the theory of magnetic monopoles. We propose
an {\it axial} magnetic current instead and show that such difficulties are
solved. Charge quantization is shown to be intimately connected with results of
theories of discrete space time.
