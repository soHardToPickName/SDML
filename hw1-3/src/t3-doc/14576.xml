<title>
Gauge invariant reformulation and BRST quantization of the nonconfining
  Schwinger model
</title>

<abstract>
  A new generalization of the vector Schwinger model is considered where gauge
symmetry is broken at the quantum mechanical level. By proper extension of the
phase space this broken symmetry has been restored. Also an equivalent first
class theory is reformulated in the actual phase space using Mitra and
Rajaraman's prescription \cite{mr1,mr2}. A BRST invariant effective action is
also formulated. The new dynamical fields introduced, turn into Wess-Zumino
scalar.
