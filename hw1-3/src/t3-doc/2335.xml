<title>
A Note on Abelian Conversion of Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that for a system containing a set of general second class
constraints which are linear in the phase space variables, the Abelian
conversion can be obtained in a closed form and that the first class
constraints generate a generalized shift symmetry. We study in detail the
example of a general first order Lagrangian and show how the shift symmetry
noted in the context of BV quantization arises.
