<title>
Local gravitational supersymmetry of Chern-Simons theory in the vielbein
  formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the Chern-Simons theory in three-dimensional curved space-time in
the vielbein formalism. Due to the additional presence of the local Lorentz
symmetry, beside the diffeomorphisms, we will include a local gravitational
supersymmetry (superdiffeomorphisms and super-Lorentz transformations), which
allows us to show the perturbative finiteness at all orders.
