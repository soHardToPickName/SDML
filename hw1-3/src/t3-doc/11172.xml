Three-Dimensional Gauge Theories and ADE Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  We study three-dimensional N=4 gauge theories with product gauge groups
constructed from ADE Dynkin diagrams. One-loop corrections to the metric on the
Coulomb branch are shown to coincide with the metric on the moduli space of
well-seperated ADE monopoles. We propose that this correspondence is exact.
