On the D = 4, N = 2 Non-Renormalization Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the harmonic superspace background field formulation for general D=4,
N=2 super Yang-Mills theories, with matter hypermultiplets in arbitrary
representations of the gauge group, we present the first rigorous proof of the
N=2 non-renormalization theorem; specifically, the absence of ultraviolet
divergences beyond the one-loop level. Another simple consequence of the
background field formulation is the absence of the leading non-holomorphic
correction to the low-energy effective action at two loops.
