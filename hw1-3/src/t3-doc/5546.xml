<title>
Second Order Derivative Supersymmetry and Scattering Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  Extensions of standard one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics are
discussed. Supercharges involving higher order derivatives are introduced
leading to an algebra which incorporates a higher order polynomial in the
Hamiltonian. We study scattering amplitudes for that problem. We also study the
role of a dilatation of the spatial coordinate leading to a q-deformed
supersymmetric algebra. An explicit model for the scattering amplitude is
constructed in terms of a hypergeometric function which corresponds to a
reflectionless potential with infinitely many bound states.
