<title>
A Monopole-Antimonopole Solution of the SU(2) Yang-Mills-Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  As shown by Taubes, in the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield limit the SU(2)
Yang-Mills-Higgs model possesses smooth finite energy solutions, which do not
satisfy the first order Bogomol'nyi equations. We construct numerically such a
non-Bogomol'nyi solution, corresponding to a monopole-antimonopole pair, and
extend the construction to finite Higgs potential.
