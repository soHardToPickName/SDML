Relativistic Dynamics of Spin in Strong External Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamics of relativistic spinning particles in strong external
electromagnetic or gravitational fields is discussed. Spin-orbit coupling is
shown to affect such relativistic phenomena as time-dilation and perihelion
shift. Possible applications include muon decay in a magnetic field and the
dynamics of neutron stars in binary systems.
