Finiteness Conditions for Light-Front Hamiltonians
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of simple models, it is shown that demanding finiteness for
physical masses with respect to a longitudinal cutoff, can be used to fix the
ambiguity in the renormalization of fermions masses in the Hamiltonian
light-front formulation. Difficulties that arise in applications of finiteness
conditions to discrete light-cone quantization are discussed.
