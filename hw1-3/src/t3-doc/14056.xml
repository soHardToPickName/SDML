Chiral Rings and Phases of Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve for the expectation values of chiral operators in supersymmetric
U(N) gauge theories with matter in the adjoint, fundamental and
anti-fundamental representations. A simple geometric picture emerges involving
a description by a meromorphic one-form on a Riemann surface. The equations of
motion are equivalent to a condition on the integrality of periods of this
form. The solution indicates that all semiclassical phases with the same number
of U(1) factors are continuously connected.
