<title>
Exact solution and interfacial tension of the six-vertex model with
  anti-periodic boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
We consider the six-vertex model with anti-periodic boundary conditions across
a finite strip. The row-to-row transfer matrix is diagonalised by the
`commuting transfer matrices' method. {}From the exact solution we obtain an
independent derivation of the interfacial tension of the six-vertex model in
the anti-ferroelectric phase. The nature of the corresponding integrable
boundary condition on the $XXZ$ spin chain is also discussed.
