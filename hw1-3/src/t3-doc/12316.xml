Two-Component Reduction of Nahm's Equations and Hyper-elliptic Solution
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the general hyper-elliptic solutions to the two-component reduced
Nahm equations proposed by Hitchin et al. Elliptic solutions are a special case
and can appear only for specific values of the monopole charges.
