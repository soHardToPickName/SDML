<title>
Coinvariants of nilpotent subalgebras of the Virasoro algebra and
  partition identities
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that the dimensions of coinvariants of certain nilpotent subalgebras
of the Virasoro algebra do not change under deformation in the case of
irreducible representations of (2,2r+1) minimal models. We derive a
combinatorial description of these representations and the Gordon identities
from this result.
