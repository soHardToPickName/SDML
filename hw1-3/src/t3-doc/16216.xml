Exact Duality and Nilpotent Gauging
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain new duality transformations relating some exact string backgrounds,
by defining the nilpotent duality. We show that the ungauged $SL(2, R)$ WZW
model transforms by its action into the three dimensional plane wave geometry.
We also give the inverse transformation from the plane wave to the $SL(2, R)$
model and discuss the implications of the results.
