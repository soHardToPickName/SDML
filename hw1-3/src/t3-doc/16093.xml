<title>
A finite model of two-dimensional ideal hydrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  A finite-dimensional su($N$) Lie algebra equation is discussed that in the
infinite $N$ limit (giving the area preserving diffeomorphism group) tends to
the two-dimensional, inviscid vorticity equation on the torus. The equation is
numerically integrated, for various values of $N$, and the time evolution of an
(interpolated) stream function is compared with that obtained from a simple
mode truncation of the continuum equation. The time averaged vorticity moments
and correlation functions are compared with canonical ensemble averages.
