<title>
On Different Formulations of Chiral Bosons
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown, that recently constructed PST Lagrangians for chiral
supergravities follow directly from earlier Kavalov-Mkrtchyan Lagrangians by an
Ansatz for the $\theta $ tensor by expressing this in terms of the PST scalar.
The susy algebra which included earlier $\alpha$-symmetry in the commutator of
supersymmetry transformations, is now shown to include both PST symmetries,
which arise from the single $\alpha$-symmetry term. The Lagrangian for the
5-brane is not described by this correspondence, and probably can be obtained
from more general Lagrangians, posessing $\alpha$-symmetry.
