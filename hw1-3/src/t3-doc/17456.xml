<title>
On Dubrovin Topological Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  I show that the new topological field theories recently associated by
Dubrovin with each Coxeter group may be all obtained in a simple way by a
``restriction'' of the standard ADE solutions. I then study the Chebichev
specializations of these topological algebras, examine how the Coxeter graphs
and matrices reappear in the dual algebra and mention the intriguing connection
with the operator product algebra of conformal field theories. A direct
understanding of the occurrence of Coxeter groups in that context is highly
desirable.
