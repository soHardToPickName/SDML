<title>
The HOMFLY polynomial for torus links from Chern-Simons gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Polynomial invariants corresponding to the fundamental representation of the
gauge group $SU(N)$ are computed for arbitrary torus knots and links in the
framework of Chern-Simons gauge theory making use of knot operators. As a
result, a formula for the HOMFLY polynomial for arbitrary torus links is
presented.
