Deformed QED via Seiberg-Witten Map
</title>

<abstract>
  With the help of the Seiberg-Witten map for photons and fermions we define a
theta-deformed QED at the classical level. Two possibilities of gauge-fixing
are discussed. A possible non-Abelian extension for a pure theta-deformed
Yang-Mills theory is also presented.
