<title>
Propagation of a relativistic particle in terms of the unitary
  irreducible representations of the Lorentz group
</title>

<abstract>
  In a generalized Heisenberg/Schroedinger picture we use an invariant
space-time transformation to describe the motion of a relativistic particle. We
discuss the relation with the relativistic mechanics and find that the
propagation of the particle may be defined as space-time transition between
states with equal eigenvalues of the first and second Casimir operators of the
Lorentz algebra. In addition we use a vector on the light-cone. A massive
relativistic particle with spin 0 is considered. We also consider the
nonrelativistic limit.
