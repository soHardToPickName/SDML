<title>
Geometrical approach to Feynman integrals and the epsilon-expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  Application of the geometrically-inspired representations to the
epsilon-expansion of the two-point function with different masses is
considered. Explicit result for an arbitrary term of the expansion is obtained
in terms of log-sine integrals. Construction of the epsilon-expansion in the
three-point case is also discussed.
