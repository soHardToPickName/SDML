<title>
Effective quark Lagrangian in the instanton-gas model
</title>

<abstract>
  A straightforward derivation of the effective quark Lagrangian is presented
for the topologically neutral chiral broken phase of the dilute instanton gas.
The resulting quark Lagrangian is a nonlocal NJL-type and contains 4q, 6q,...
vertices for any number of flavours. Correspondence of this result with
previously known in literature is discussed in detail.
