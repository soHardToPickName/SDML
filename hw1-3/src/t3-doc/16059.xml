Dirac's Legacy: Light-Cone Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent years light-cone quantization of quantum field theory has emerged
as a promising method for solving problems in the strong coupling regime. This
approach has a number of unique features that make it particularly appealing,
most notably, the ground state of the free theory is also a ground state of the
full theory.
