Localization of Bulk Fields on AdS_4 Brane in AdS_5
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the localization of various bulk fields on an $AdS_4$ brane in
$AdS_5$. In this case, for a small brane cosmological constant, all the bulk
fields ranging from scalar to graviton are naturally confined to the brane only
through the gravitational interaction. In particular, for the vector field we
can find an interesting zero mode solution which satisfies the box boundary
condition. In the cases of spin 1/2 spinor and 3/2 gravitino fields, the form
of zero modes is very similar to as in a flat Minkowski brane, but they are
trapped on the $AdS_4$ brane even without introducing a mass term with a 'kink'
profile.
