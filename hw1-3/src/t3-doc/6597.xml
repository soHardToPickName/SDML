Note on mirror symmetry and coisotropic D-branes on tori
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe mirror symmetry on higher dimensional tori, paying special
attention to the behaviour of D-branes under mirror symmetry. To find the
mirror D-branes the description of mirror symmetry on D-branes due to Ooguri,
Oz en Yin is used. This method allows us to deal with the coisotropic D-branes
recently introduced by Kapustin and Orlov. We compare this to the description
of mirror symmetry on D-branes using the Fourier-Mukai transform of charges.
