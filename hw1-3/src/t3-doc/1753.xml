Hamiltonian Reduction and Topological Conformal Algebra in $c\leq 1$
  Non-critical Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the hamiltonian reduction of affine Lie superalgebra
$sl(2|1)^{(1)}$. Based on a scalar Lax operator formalism, we derive the free
field realization of the classical topological topological algebra which
appears in the $c\leq1$ non-critical strings. In the quantum case, we analyze
the BRST cohomology to get the quantum free field expression of the algebra.
