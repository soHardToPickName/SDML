<title>
Supersymmetric Nambu-Jona-Lasinio Model in an External Gravitational
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the effect of an external gravitational fields to the chiral
symmetry breaking in the SUSY (supersymmetric) NJL (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) model
non-minimally interacting with external supergravity. Evaluating the effective
potential in the leading order of the $1/N_{c}$-expansion and in the linear
curvature approximation it is found the possibility of the chiral symmetry
breaking in the SUSY NJL model in an external gravitational fields. In the
broken phase the dynamically generated mass is analytically and numerically
calculated.
