<title>
SUSY Gauge Dynamics and Singularities of 4d N=1 String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  Many N=1 heterotic string compactifications exhibit physically mysterious
singularities at codimension one in the moduli space of vacua. At these
singularities, Yukawa couplings of charged fields develop poles as a function
of the moduli. We explain these conformal field theory singularities, in a
class of examples, as arising from non-perturbative gauge dynamics of
non-perturbative gauge bosons (whose gauge coupling is the sigma model
coupling) in the string theory.
