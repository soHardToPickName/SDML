<title>
Light-Front Quantization and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  The spontaneous symmetry breaking (and Higgs) mechanism in the theory
quantized on the light-front ({\it l.f.}), in the {\it discretized
formulation}, is discussed. The infinite volume limit is taken to obtain the
{\it continuum version}. The hamiltonian formulation is shown to contain a new
ingredient in the form of nonlocal {\it constraint eqs.} which lead to a {\it
nonlocal l.f. Hamiltonian}. The description of the broken symmetry here has the
same physical content as in the conventional formulation though arrived at
through a different mechanism.
