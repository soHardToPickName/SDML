A Deformation of Three Dimensional BF Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a deformation of three dimensional BF theory by means of the
antifield BRST formalism. Possible deformations for the action and the gauge
symmetries are analyzed. We find a new class of gauge theories which include
nonabelian BF theory, higher dimensional nonlinear gauge theory and topological
membrane theory.
