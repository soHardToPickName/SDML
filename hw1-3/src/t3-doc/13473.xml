Closed String Brane-Like States, Brane Bound States and Noncommutative
  Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the mass and different RR charge distributions of the BPS
(p,p-2)-brane bound states in the closed string brane-like $\sigma$-model. We
show that such brane bound states can be realized by introducing a constant B
field in the closed string theory. In addition we show that the worldvolume
coordinates of these brane bound states turn out to be noncommutative.
