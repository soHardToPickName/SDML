Bulk Gauge Fields in the Bigravity Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by a recently proposed "bigravity" model with two positive tension
$AdS_4$ branes in $AdS_5$ by Kogan et al.[hep-th/0011141], we study behavior of
bulk gauge field in the model. In this case, the zero mode of the gauge field
is not constant but depends on the fifth dimensional coordinate transverse to
the brane. The zero mode then becomes massive on the brane. From the physical
requirement that the mass must be small, a parameter of the model is
constrained. We also discuss the Kaluza-Klein modes.
