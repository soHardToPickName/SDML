<title>
Two--poles R-matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We study integrable dynamical systems described by a Lax pair involving a
spectral parameter. By solving the classical Yang-Baxter equation when the
R-matrix has two poles we show that they can be interpreted as natural motions
on a twisted loop algebra.
