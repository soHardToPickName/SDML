<title>
On One-Loop Approximation to Tachyon Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the one-loop corrections to the tachyon potentials in both,
bosonic and supersymmetric, cases by worldsheet methods. In the process, we
also get some insight on tachyon condensation from the viewpoint of closed
string modes and show that there is an instability due to the closed string
tachyon in the bosonic case.
