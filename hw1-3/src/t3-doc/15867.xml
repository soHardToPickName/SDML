<title>
New Integrable Lattice Models From Fuss-Catalan Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new trigonometric solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, using
the Fuss-Catalan algebras, a set of multi-colored versions of the
Temperley-Lieb algebra, recently introduced by Bisch and Jones. These lead to
new two-dimensional integrable lattice models, describing dense gases of
colored loops.
