<title>
Four Dimensional Black Holes and Strings with Rescaled Tension
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a microscopic description of extreme and near-extreme
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four dimensions in terms of fundamental
strings in a background of magnetic five branes and monopoles. The string
oscillator numbers and tension are rescaled due to the Rindler space background
with the string mass fixed. The entropy of the black holes is reproduced
correctly by that of the string with the tension rescaling taken into account.
