<title>
Exact calculation of the radiatively-induced Lorentz and CPT violation
  in QED
</title>

<abstract>
  Radiative corrections arising from the axial coupling of charged fermions to
a constant vector b_\mu can induce a Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons
term in the QED action. We calculate the exact one-loop correction to this term
keeping the full b_\mu dependence, and show that in the physically interesting
cases it coincides with the lowest-order result. The effect of regularization
and renormalization and the implications of the result are briefly discussed.
