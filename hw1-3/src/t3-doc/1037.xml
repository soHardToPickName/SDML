<title>
Nonselfdual solutions for gauge fields in Schwarzschild and deSitter
  backgrounds for dimension $d\geq 4$
</title>

<abstract>
  A particularly simple class of nonselfdual solutions are obtained for gauge
fields in Schwarzschild and deSitter backgrounds. For Lorentz signature these
have finite energy and finite action for Euclidean signature. In each case one
obtains either real or a pair of complex conjugate solutions. The actions are
easily computed for any dimension d. Numerical values are given for d=
4,6,7,8,9,10. It is explained why d=5 is a very special case. Possible
continuations and generalizations of the results obtained are indicated. A
particular solution for AdS_4 background is presented in the Appendix.
