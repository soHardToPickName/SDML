<title>
Chiral bosons and improper constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that a consistent quantization of the Floreanini-Jackiw model, as a
constrained system, should start by recognizing the improper nature of the
constraints. Then each boundary conditon defines a problem which must be
treated sparately. The model is settled on a compact domain which allows for a
discrete formulation of the dynamics; thus, avoiding the mixing of local with
collective coordinates. For periodic boundary conditions the model turns out to
be a gauge theory whose gauge invariant sector contains only chiral
excitations. For antiperiodoc boundary conditions, the mode is a second-class
theory where the excitations are also chiral. In both cases, the equal-time
algebra of the quantum energy-momentum densities is a Virasoro algebra. The
Poincar\'e symmetry holds for the finite as well as for the infinite domain.
