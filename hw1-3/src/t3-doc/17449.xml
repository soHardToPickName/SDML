<title>
On flat connections with non-diagonalizable holonomies
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the long-standing puzzle about counting the Witten index in N=1
supersymmetric gauge theories was resolved. The resolution was based on
existence (for higher orthogonal $SO(N), N \geq 7$ and exceptional gauge
groups) of flat connections on $T^{3}$ which have commuting holonomies but
cannot be gauged to a Cartan torus. A number of papers has been published which
studied moduli spaces and some topological characteristics of those flat
connections. In the present letter an explicit description of such flat
connection for the basic case of $Spin(7)$ is given.
