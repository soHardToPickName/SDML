Comments on Open Wilson Lines and Generalized Star Products
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an open Wilson line as a momentum representation of a boundary
state which describes a D-brane in a constant B-field background. Using this
picture, we study the Seiberg-Witten map which relates the commutative and
noncommutative gauge fields, and determine the products of fields appearing in
the general terms in the expansion of this map.
