<title>
Ultra-violet Behavior of Bosonic Quantum Membranes
</title>

<abstract>
  We treat the action for a bosonic membrane as a sigma model, and then compute
quantum corrections by integrating out higher membrane modes. As in string
theory, where the equations of motion of Einstein's theory emerges by setting
$\beta = 0$, we find that, with certain assumptions, we can recover the
equations of motion for the background fields. Although the membrane theory is
non-renormalizable on the world volume by power counting, the investigation of
the ultra-violet behavior of membranes may give us insight into the
supersymmetric case, where we hope to obtain higher order M-theory corrections
to 11 dimensional supergravity.
