Closed Superstring in Noncommutative Compact Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the effects of noncommutativity on a closed
superstring propagating in the spacetime that is compactified on tori. The
effects of compactification and noncommutativity appear in the momentum,
quantization, supercurrent, super-conformal generators and in the boundary
state of the closed superstring emitted from a D$_p$-brane with the
NS$\otimes$NS background $B$-field.
