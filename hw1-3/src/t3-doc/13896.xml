<title>
Holography Principle and Topology Change in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  D-instantons of Type IIB string theory are Ramond-Ramond counterpart of
Giddings-Strominger wormholes connecting two asymptotic regions of spacetime.
Such wormholes, according to Coleman, might lead to spacetime topology change,
third-quantized baby universes and probabilistic determination of fundamental
coupling parameters. Utilizing correspondence between AdS5 x M5 Type IIB
supergravity and d=4 super Yang-Mills theory, we point out that topology change
and sum over topologies not only take place in string theory but also are
required for consistency with holography. Nevertheless, the effects of
D-instanton wormholes remain completely deterministic, in sharp contrast to
Coleman's scenario.
