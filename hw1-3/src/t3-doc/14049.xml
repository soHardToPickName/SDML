SL(2,R) Yang-Mills theory on a circle
</title>

<abstract>
  The kinematics of SL(2,R) Yang-Mills theory on a circle is considered, for
reasons that are spelled out. The gauge transformations exhibit hyperbolic
fixed points, and this results in a physical configuration space with a
non-Hausdorff "network" topology. The ambiguity encountered in canonical
quantization is then much more pronounced than in the compact case, and can not
be resolved through the kind of appeal made to group theory in that case.
