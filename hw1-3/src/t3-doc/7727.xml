<title>
Toward a q-Deformed Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  A gauge theory with an underlying SU_q(2) quantum group symmetry is
introduced, and its properties examined. With suitable assumptions, this model
is found to have many similarities with the usual SU(2)\times U(1) Standard
Model, specifically, the existence of four generators and thus four gauge
fields. However, the two classical symmetries are unified into one quantum
symmetry, and therefore there is only a single coupling constant, rather than
two. By incorporating a Higgs sector into the model, one obtains several
explicit tree-level predictions in the undeformed limit, such as the Weinberg
angle: $sin^2\Theta_{W} = 3/11$. With the Z-boson mass m_Z and fine structure
constant alpha as inputs, one can also obtain predictions for the weak coupling
constant, the mass of the W, and the Higgs VEV. The breaking of the quantum
invariance also results in a remaining undeformed U(1) gauge symmetry.
