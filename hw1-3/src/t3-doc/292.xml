Calculation of Gromov-Witten invariants for $ CP^{3},CP^{4}$,and
  $Gr(2,4)$
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the associativity relations of the topological Sigma Models with target
spaces, $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ , we derive recursion relations of their
correlation and evaluate them up to certain order in the expansion over the
instantons. The expansion coeffieients are regarded as the number of rational
curves in $CP^3, CP^4$ and $Gr(2,4)$ which intersect various types of
submanifolds corresponding to the choice of BRST invariant operators in the
correlation functions.
