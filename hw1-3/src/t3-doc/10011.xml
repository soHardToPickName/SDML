Brane Theory Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Field theories that describe {\sl small} fluctuations of branes are limits of
`brane theories' that describe {\sl large} fluctuations. In particular,
supersymmetric sigma-models arise in this way. These lectures discuss the
soliton solutions of the associated `brane theories' and their relation to
calibrations.
