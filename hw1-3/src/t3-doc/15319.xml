<title>
Point-Like Interactions in String Theory Induced by 2-D Topological
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a string theory with two types of strings with geometric
interaction. We show that the theory contains strings with constant Dirichlet
boundary condition and those strings are glued together by 2-d topological
gravity with macroscopic boundaries. A light-cone string field theory is given
and the theory has interactions to all orders. (Postscript files of the figures
can be obtained by anonymous ftp uful07.phys.ufl.edu and are in the directory
/het/ufift-hep-92-26.)
