Composite p-Branes in Diverse Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a simple algebraic method to find a special class of composite p-brane
solutions of higher dimensional gravity coupled with matter. These solutions
are composed of n constituent p-branes corresponding n independent harmonic
functions. A simple algebraic criteria of existence of such solutions is
presented. Relations with D=11,10 known solutions are discussed.
