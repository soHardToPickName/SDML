On The Finite Temperature Chern-Simons Coefficient
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the exact finite temperature effective action in a 0+1-dimensional
field theory containing a topological Chern-Simons term, which has many
features in common with 2+1-dimensional Chern-Simons theories. This exact
result explains the origin and meaning of puzzling temperature dependent
coefficients found in various naive perturbative computations in the higher
dimensional models.
