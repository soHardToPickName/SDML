Massless monopole clouds and electric-magnetic duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We qualitatively discuss the Montonen-Olive electric-magnetic duality in N=4
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with non-Abelian unbroken gauge symmetries,
where BPS configurations of massless monopole clouds have been found. We argue
that these low energy non-Abelian clouds can be identified as the dual of the
infrared bremsstrahlung radiations of the non-Abelian massless particles. After
we break the N=4 supersymmetry to N=1 by adding a superpotential, or to N=0 by
further adding soft breaking terms, these non-Abelian clouds will generally
condense and screen the non-Abelian charges of the massive monopole probes. The
effective mass of these dual non-Abelian states is likely to persist as we
lower the energy to QCD scale if all non-Abelian Higgs are massive. This meets
the expectation of the dual Meissner effect that the magnetic theory is in the
dual Higgs phase.
