<title>
Higher spins dynamics in the closed string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The general $\sigma$-model-type string action including both massless and
massive higher spins background fields is suggested. Field equations for
background fields are followed from the requirement of quantum Weyl invariance.
It is shown that renormalization of the theory can be produced level by level.
The detailed consideration of background fields structure and corresponding
fields equations is given for the first massive level of the closed bosonic
string.
