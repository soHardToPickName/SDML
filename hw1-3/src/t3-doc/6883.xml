<title>
The Uniqueness of the Abelian Born-Infeld Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from BPS solutions to Yang-Mills which define a stable holomorphic
vector bundle, we investigate its deformations. Assuming slowly varying
fieldstrengths, we find in the abelian case a unique deformation given by the
abelian Born-Infeld action. We obtain the deformed Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau
stability condition to all orders in alpha'. This result provides strong
evidence supporting the claim that the only supersymmetric deformation of the
abelian d=10 supersymmetric Yang-Mills action is the Born-Infeld action.
