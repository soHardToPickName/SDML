An N=8 Superaffine Malcev Algebra and Its N=8 Sugawara
</title>

<abstract>
  A supersymmetric affinization of the algebra of octonions is introduced. It
satisfies a super-Malcev property and is N=8 supersymmetric. Its Sugawara
construction recovers, in a special limit, the non-associative N=8 superalgebra
of Englert et al. This paper extends to supersymmetry the results obtained by
Osipov in the bosonic case.
