<title>
The Bosonic String Measure at Two and Three Loops and Symplectic
  Transformations of the Volume Form
</title>

<abstract>
  Symplectic modular invariance of the bosonic string partition function has
been verified at genus 2 and 3 using the period matrix coordinatization of
moduli space. A calculation of the transformation of the holomorphic part of
the differential volume element shows that an extra phase arises together with
the factor associated with a specific modular weight; the phase is cancelled in
the transformation of the entire volume element including the complex
conjugate. An argument is given for modular invariance of the reggeon measure
at genus twelve.
