<title>
Towards a Nonperturbative Covariant Regularization in 4D Quantum Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a noncommutative version of the complex projective space CP^2 and
show that scalar QFT on this space is free of UV divergencies. The tools
necessary to investigate Quantum fields on this fuzzy CP^2 are developed and
possibilities to introduce spinors and Dirac operators are discussed.
