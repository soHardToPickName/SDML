<title>
Universality of random matrices in the microscopic limit and the Dirac
  operator spectrum
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the universality of correlation functions of chiral unitary and
unitary ensembles of random matrices in the microscopic limit. The essence of
the proof consists in reducing the three-term recursion relation for the
relevant orthogonal polynomials into a Bessel equation governing the local
asymptotics around the origin. The possible physical interpretation as the
universality of soft spectrum of the Dirac operator is briefly discussed.
