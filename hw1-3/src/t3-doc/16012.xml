Finite Temperature Nonlocal Effective Action for Scalar Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Scalar fields at finite temperature are considered in four dimensional
ultrastatic curved spacetime. One loop nonlocal effective action at finite
temperature is found up to the second order in curvature expansion. This action
is explicitly infrared finite. In the high temperature expansion of free
energy, essentially nonlocal terms linear in temperature are derived.
