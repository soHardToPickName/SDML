QCD Flux Tubes as Sigma Model Relics
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe flux tubes and their interactions in a low energy sigma model
induced by $SU(\NF) \goto SO(\NF)$ flavor symmetry breaking in $SO(N_c)$ QCD.
Gauge confinement manifests itself in the low energy theory through flux tube
interactions with unscreened sources. The flux tubes which mediate confinement
also illustrate an interesting ambiguity in defining global Alice strings.
