Stacks and D-Brane Bundles
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we describe explicitly how the twisted ``bundles'' on a D-brane
worldvolume in the presence of a nontrivial B field, can be understood in terms
of sheaves on stacks. We also take this opportunity to provide the physics
community with a readable introduction to stacks and generalized spaces.
