Jackson Integral Representations for Solutions to the Quantized
  Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantized Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations associated with the
trigonometric R-matrix or the rational R-matrix of the A-type are considered.
Jackson integral representations for solutions of these equations are
described. Asymptotic solutions for a holonomic system of difference equations
are constructed. Relations between the integral representations and the Bethe
ansatz are indicated.
