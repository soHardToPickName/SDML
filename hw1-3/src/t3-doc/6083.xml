Highest weight representations of the N=1 Ramond algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the highest weight representations of the N=1 Ramond algebra and
show that their structure is richer than previously suggested in the
literature. In particular, we show that certain Verma modules over the N=1
Ramond algebra contain degenerate (2-dimensional) singular vector spaces and
that in the supersymmetric case they can even contain subsingular vectors.
After choosing a suitable ordering for the N=1 Ramond algebra generators we
compute the ordering kernel, which turns out to be two-dimensional for complete
Verma modules and one-dimensional for G-closed Verma modules. These
two-dimensional ordering kernels allow us to derive multiplication rules for
singular vector operators and lead to expressions for degenerate singular
vectors. Using these multiplication rules we study descendant singular vectors
and derive the Ramond embedding diagrams for the rational models. We give all
explicit examples for singular vectors, degenerate singular vectors, and
subsingular vectors until level 3. We conjecture the ordering kernel
coefficients of all (primitive) singular vectors and therefore identify these
vectors uniquely.
