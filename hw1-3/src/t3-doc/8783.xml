Gauge-Invariant Couplings of Noncommutative Branes to Ramond-Ramond
  Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the couplings of noncommutative D-branes to spatially varying
Ramond-Ramond fields, extending our earlier results in hep-th/0009101. These
couplings are expressed in terms of *n products of operators involving open
Wilson lines. Equivalence of the noncommutative to the commutative couplings
implies interesting identities as well as an expression for the Seiberg-Witten
map that was previously conjectured. We generalise our couplings to include
transverse scalars, thereby obtaining a Seiberg-Witten map relating commutative
and noncommutative descriptions of these scalars. RR couplings for unstable
non-BPS branes are also proposed.
