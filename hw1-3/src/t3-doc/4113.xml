<title>
The `s-rule' exclusion principle and vacuum interpolation in worldvolume
  dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the worldvolume realization of the Hanany-Witten effect for a
supersymmetric D5-brane in a D3 background also provides a classical
realization of the `s-rule' exclusion principle. Despite the supersymmetry, the
force on the D5-brane vanishes only in the D5 `ground state', which is shown to
interpolate between 6-dimensional Minkowski space and an $OSp(4^*|4)$-invariant
$adS_2\times S^4$ geometry. The M-theory analogue of these results is briefly
discussed.
