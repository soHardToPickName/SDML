How Does God Play Dice? (Pre-)Determinism at the Planck Scale
</title>

<abstract>
  In deterministic theories, one can start from a set of ontological states to
formulate the dynamical laws, but these may not be directly observable.
Observable are only equivalence classes of states, and these will span a basis
of "beables", to be promoted to an orthonormal basis of Hilbert Space. After
transforming this basis to a more conventional basis, a theory may result that
is fundamentally quantum mechanical. It is conjectured that the quantum laws of
the real world may be understood from exactly such a procedure.
