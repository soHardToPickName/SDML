<title>
Induced N=2 composite supersymmetry in 2+1 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from N=1 scalar supermultiplets in 2+1 dimensions, we build
explicitly the composite superpartners which define a N=2 superalgebra induced
by the initial N=1 supersymmetry. The occurrence of this extension is linked to
the topologically conserved current out of which the composite superpartners
are constructed.
