Hairs on the Unicorn: Fine Structure of Monopoles and Other Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Intrinsically stable or `fundamental' solitons may be decorated with
conserved charges which are pieces of those carried by elementary particles in
the same medium. These `hairs' are always significant in principle, and in the
strong-coupling regime (where solitons and particles exchange roles) may become
major factors in dynamics.
