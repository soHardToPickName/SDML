A Remark on Smoothing Out Higher Codimension Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some issues arising in studying (linearized) gravity on non-BPS
higher codimension branes in an infinite-volume bulk. In particular, such
backgrounds are badly singular for codimension-3 and higher delta-function-like
branes with non-zero tension. As we discuss in this note, non-trivial issues
arise in smoothing out such singularities. Thus, adding higher curvature terms
might be necessary in this context.
