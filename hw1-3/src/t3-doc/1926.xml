Morita Equivalence and Interpolation of The Dirac-Born-infeld Theory on
  the Non-Commutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  In the noncommutative Dirac-Born-Infeld action with Chern-Simons term, an
interpolation field $\Phi$ is used in both DBI action and Chern-Simons term.
The Morita equivalence is discussed in both the lagrangian and the Hamiltonian
formalisms, which is more transparent in this treatment.
