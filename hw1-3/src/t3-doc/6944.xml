<title>
W Algebras, W Gravities and their Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  By generalizing the Drinfel'd--Sokolov reduction we construct a large class
of W algebras as reductions of Kac--Moody algebras. Furthermore we construct
actions, invariant under local left and right W transformations, which are the
classical covariant induced actions for W gravity. Talk presented by T. Tjin at
the Trieste Summerschool on strings and related topics.
