<title>
Relativistic wave equations with fractional derivatives and
  pseudo-differential operators
</title>

<abstract>
  The class of the free relativistic covariant equations generated by the
fractional powers of the D'Alambertian operator $(\square^{1/n})$ is studied.
Meanwhile the equations corresponding to n=1 and 2 (Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations) are local in their nature, the multicomponent equations for
arbitrary n>2 are non-local. It is shown, how the representation of generalized
algebra of Pauli and Dirac matrices looks like and how these matrices are
related to the algebra of SU(n) group. The corresponding representations of the
Poincar\'e group and further symmetry transformations on the obtained equations
are discussed. The construction of the related Green functions is suggested.
