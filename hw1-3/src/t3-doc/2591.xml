<title>
Equivalence of Constrained Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study two constrained scalar models. While there seems to be equivalence
when the partially integrated Feynman path integral is expanded graphically,
the dynamical behaviour of the two models are different when quantization is
done using Dirac constraint analysis.
