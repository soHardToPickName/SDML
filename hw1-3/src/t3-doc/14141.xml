Renormalization group equations in curved space-time with non-trivial
  Topology
</title>

<abstract>
  Renormalization group equations for massless GUT's in curved space-time with
non-trivial topology are formulated. The asymptotics of the effective action
both at high and low energies are obtained. It is shown that the Casimir energy
contribution at high curvature (early Universe) becomes non-essential in the
effective action.
