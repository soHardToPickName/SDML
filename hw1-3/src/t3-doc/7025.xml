<title>
From Hamiltonian to Lagrangian Sp(2) BRST Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a formal proof of the equivalence of Hamiltonian and Lagrangian BRST
quantization. This is done for a generic $Sp(2)$-symmetric theory using flat
(Darboux) coordinates. A new quantum master equation is derived in a
Hamiltonian setting which contains all the Hamiltonian fields and momenta of a
given theory.
