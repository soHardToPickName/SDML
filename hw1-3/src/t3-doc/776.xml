<title>
Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz for boundary sine-Gordon model
</title>

<abstract>
  (R-channel) TBA is elaborated to find the effective central charge dependence
on the boundary parameters for the massless boundary sine-Gordon model with the
coupling constant $(8\pi)/\beta^2 = 1+ \lambda$ with $\lambda$ a positive
integer. Numerical analysis of the massless boundary TBA demonstrates that
excited state contributions should be included to have the right behavior of
the effective central charge.
