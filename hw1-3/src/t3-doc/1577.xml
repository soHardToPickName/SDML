Effective quark interactions from QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new method for an analytical, non-perturbative computation of
effective quark interactions from QCD. It is based on an exact flow equation
which describes the scale dependence of the effective average action for quarks
in presence of gluons.
