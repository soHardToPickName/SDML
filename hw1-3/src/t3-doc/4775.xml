Exact Three Dimensional Black Holes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A black hole solution to three dimensional general relativity with a negative
cosmological constant has recently been found. We show that a slight
modification of this solution yields an exact solution to string theory. This
black hole is equivalent (under duality) to the previously discussed three
dimensional black string solution. Since the black string is asymptotically
flat and the black hole is asymptotically anti-de Sitter, this suggests that
strings are not affected by a negative cosmological constant in three
dimensions.
