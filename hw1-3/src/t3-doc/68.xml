<title>
F-Theory and the universal string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the techniques of the ``universal string theory'' to the
``manifold'' paradigm for superstring/M-theory and come up with a candidate
manifold: the manifold of F-theory vacua, defined in conformal field
theoretical terms. It contains the five known superstring theories as
particular vacua; although the natural vacua are (10+2)-dimensional. As a
byproduct, a natural explanation emerges for the compactness of the extra two
coordinates in F-theory.
