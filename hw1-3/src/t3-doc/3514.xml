Computations in Large N Matrix Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebraic formulation of Large N matrix mechanics recently developed by
Halpern and Schwartz leads to a practical method of numerical computation for
both action and Hamiltonian problems. The new technique posits a boundary
condition on the planar connected parts X_w, namely that they should decrease
rapidly with increasing order. This leads to algebraic/variational schemes of
computation which show remarkably rapid convergence in numerical tests on some
many- matrix models. The method allows the calculation of all moments of the
ground state, in a sequence of approximations, and excited states can be
determined as well. There are two unexpected findings: a large d expansion and
a new selection rule for certain types of interaction.
