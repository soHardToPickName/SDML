<title>
Nonrenormalizability of (Last Hope) D=11 Supergravity, with a Terse
  Survey of Divergences in Quantum Gravities
</title>

<abstract>
  Before turning to the new result that D=11 supergravity is 2-loop
nonrenormalizable, we give a very brief history of the ultraviolet problems of
ordinary quantum gravity and of supergravities in general D.
