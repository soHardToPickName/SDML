<title>
The second law of thermodynamics, TCP, and Einstein causality in anti-de
  Sitter space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  If the vacuum is passive for uniformly accelerated observers in anti-de
Sitter space-time (i.e. cannot be used by them to operate a "perpetuum
mobile"), they will (a) register a universal value of the Hawking-Unruh
temperature, (b) discover a TCP symmetry, and (c) find that observables in
complementary wedge-shaped regions are commensurable (local) in the vacuum
state. These results are model independent and hold in any theory which is
compatible with some weak notion of space-time localization.
