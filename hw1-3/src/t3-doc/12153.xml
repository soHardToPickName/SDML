<title>
Elliptic analog of the Toda lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  The action-angle variables for N-particle Hamiltonian system with the
Hamiltonian $H=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \ln sh^{-2}(p_n/2)+\ln(\wp(x_n-x_{n+1})-
\wp(x_n+x_{n+1})), x_N=x_0,$ are constructed, and the system is solved in terms
of the Riemann $\theta$-functions. It is shown that this system describes pole
dynamics of the elliptic solutions of 2D Toda lattice corresponding to spectral
curves defined by the equation $w^2-P_{N}^{el}(z)w+\Lambda^{2N}=0$, where
$P_{N}^{el}(z)$ is an elliptic function with pole of order N at the point z=0.
