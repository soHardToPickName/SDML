D-Branes, AdS/CFT Correspondence, and T-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The $D$-brane spectra in the Type IIB string theory compactified on
$AdS_{p+2}\times S^{8-p}$ are computed using the K-theory approach. The results
signal the existence of the mirror-symmetry-analogue for $D$-branes, analogous
to that rised in the context of derived categories.
