<title>
Geometric Holography, the Renormalization Group and the c-Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper the whole geometrical set-up giving a conformally invariant
holographic projection of a diffeomorphism invariant bulk theory is clarified.
By studying the renormalization group flow along null geodesic congruences a
holographic version of Zamolodchikov's c-theorem is proven.
