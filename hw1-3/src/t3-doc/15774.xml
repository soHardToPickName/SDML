Local Physical Coodinates from Symplectic Projector Method
</title>

<abstract>
  The basic arguments underlying the symplectic projector method are presented.
By this method, local free coordinates on the constrait surface can be obtained
for a broader class of constrained systems. Some interesting examples are
analyzed.
