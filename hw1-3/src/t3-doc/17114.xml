DLCQ On a Twisted Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently it has been demonstrated by Dienes and Mafi, that the physics of
toroidal compactified models of extra dimensions can depend on the shape angle
of the torus. Toroidal compactification has also recently been used as a
regulator for numerical solutions of supersymmetric fields theories in 2+1
dimensions. The question is; does the shape angle of the torus also affect the
physics in this situation? Clearly a numerical solution should be independent
of the shape of the space we compactify on. We show that within the context of
standard DLCQ, that toroidal compactification is only allowed for a specific
set of shape angles and for that set of shape angles the numerical solutions
are unchanged.
