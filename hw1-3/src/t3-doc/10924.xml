<title>
Local Field Theory ON $\kappa$-Minkowski Space, Star Products and
  Noncommutative Translations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider local field theory on $\kappa$-deformed Minkowski space which is
an example of solvable Lie-algebraic noncommutative structure. Using
integration formula over $\kappa$-Minkowski space and $\kappa$-deformed Fourier
transform we consider for deformed local fields the reality conditions as well
as deformation of action functionals in standard Minkowski space. We present
explicite formulas for two equivalent star products describing CBH quantization
of field theory on $\kappa$-Minkowski space. We express also via star product
technique the noncommutative translations in $\kappa$-Minkowski space by
commutative translations in standard Minkowski space.
