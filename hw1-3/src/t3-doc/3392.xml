Counting BPS states of the M-5brane
</title>

<abstract>
  An on-shell model for the supersymmetric index counting multiplicities of BPS
states of the M5-brane theory is reviewed. In particular we explicitly study
the tensionless Little String states appearing at intersections in a bound
state of $N$ 5-branes wrapped on a six-manifold with product topology
$M_4\times T^2$.
