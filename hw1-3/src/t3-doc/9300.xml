Flat connections for Yang-Mills theories on the 3--torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the moduli space of flat connections of Yang-Mills theories
formulated on T^3 x R, with periodic boundary conditions. When the gauge group
is SO(N>=7), G_2, F_4, E_6, E_7 or E_8, the moduli space consists of more than
one component.
