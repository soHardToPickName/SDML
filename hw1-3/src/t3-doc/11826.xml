<title>
Braid Relations in Affine Toda Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
We provide explicit realizations for the operators which when exchanged give
rise to the scattering matrix. For affine Toda field theory we present two
alternative constructions, one related to a free bosonic theory and the other
formally to the quantum affine Heisenberg algebra of $U_q(\hat{Sl_2})$.
