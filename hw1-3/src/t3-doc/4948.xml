<title>
Proposal for non-BPS D-brane action
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short note we would like to propose a form for the action of a
non-BPS D-brane, which will be manifestly supersymmetric invariant and
T-duality covariant. We also explicitly show that tachyon condensation on the
world-volume of this brane leads to the Dirac-Born-Infeld action for BPS
D(p-1)-brane.
