Uniform Asymptotic Solutions of a System of two Schr\"odinger Equations
  with Potential-Curve-Crossing Point
</title>

<abstract>
  A formal uniform asymptotic solution of the system of differential equations
$ h^{2}\frac{d^{2}U_{1}}{dz^{2}}+\Phi_{1} U_{1}=\alpha U_{2} $ , $
h^{2}\frac{d^{2}U_{2}}{dz^{2}}+\Phi_{2} U_{2}=\alpha U_{1}$ , for $ z\in D$ and
for h real, large is obtained, when D contains curve-crossing point. Asymptotic
approximations for the solutions are constructed in terms of parabolic cylinder
functions. Analytical properties of the expansion's coefficients are
investigated.The case of potantial barier is also considered.
