Holomorphic Yang-Mills Theory on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory on compact K\"{a}hler
manifolds and show that there exists a simple mapping from the $N=2$
topological Yang-Mills theory. It follows that intersection parings on the
moduli space of Einstein-Hermitian connections can be determined by examining
the small coupling behavior of the $N=2$ holomorphic Yang-Mills theory. This
paper is a higher dimensional generalization of the Witten's work on physical
Yang-Mills theory in two dimensions.
