On the generalized unitary parasupersymmetry algebra of Beckers-Debergh
</title>

<abstract>
  An appropriate generalization of the unitary parasupersymmetry algebra of
Beckers-Debergh to arbitrary order is presented in this paper. A special
representation for realizing of the even arbitrary order unitary
parasupersymmetry algebra of Beckers-Debergh is analyzed by one dimensional
shape invariance solvable models, 2D and 3D quantum solvable models obtained
from the shape invariance theory as well. In particular in the special
representation, it is shown that the isospectrum Hamiltonians consist of the
two partner Hamiltonians of the shape invariance theory.
