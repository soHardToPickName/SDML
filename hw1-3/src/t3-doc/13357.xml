<title>
On the Vacuum Energy Density and Non-Perturbative Effects in Sigma
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuum energy density is obtained for the $O(N)$ nonlinear sigma model.
It is shown that non-perturbative contributions are connected with the square
of the symmetry current of the group $O(N)$. This result is valid for $\sigma$-
fields which are subject to the constraint.
