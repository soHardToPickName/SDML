N=2 Electric-magnetic duality in a chiral background
</title>

<abstract>
  We establish the consistency of duality transformations for generic systems
of $N=2$ vector supermultiplets in the presence of a chiral background field.
This is relevant, for instance, when dealing with spurion fields or when
considering higher-derivative couplings of vector multiplets to supergravity.
We point out that under duality most quantities do not transform as functions.
With few exceptions, true functions are nonholomorphic, even though the duality
transformations themselves are holomorphic in nature.
