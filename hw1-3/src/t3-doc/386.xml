<title>
Regulating the $P^+ = 0$ Singularity
</title>

<abstract>
  I shall discuss the regulation of the $P^+ = 0$ singularity and give some
examples. Regulating the singularity induces new operators into the theory.
This process seems rather different for the case of ultraviolet singularities
than for the case of infrared singularities.
