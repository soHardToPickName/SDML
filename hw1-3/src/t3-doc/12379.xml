Multi-soliton Solutions of Two-dimensional Matrix Davey-Stewartson
  Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The explicit formulae for m-soliton solutions of (1+2)-dimensional matrix
Davey-Stewartson equation are represented. They are found by means of known
general solution of the matrix Toda chain with the fixed ends [1]. These
solutions are expressed trough m+m independent solutions of a pair of linear
Shrodinger equations with Hermitian potentials.
