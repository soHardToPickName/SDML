Absorption of angular momentum by black holes and D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the absorption of higher angular momentum modes of scalars into
black holes, at low energies, and ask if the resulting cross sections are
reproduced by a D-brane model. To get the correct dependence on the volume of
the compactified dimensions, we must let the absorbing element in the brane
model have a tension that is the geometric mean of the tensions of the D-string
and an effective stringlike tension obtained from the D-5-brane; this choice is
also motivated by T-duality. In a dual model we note that the correct
dependence on the volume of the compact dimensions and the coupling arise if
the absorbing string is allowed to split into many strings in the process of
absorbing a higher angular momentum wave. We obtain the required energy
dependence of the cross section by carrying out the integrals resulting from
partitioning the energy of the incoming quantum into vibrations of the string.
