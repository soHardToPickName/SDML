<title>
Induced Parity Breaking Term at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the exact induced parity-breaking part of the effective action for
2+1 massive fermions in $QED_3$ at finite temperature by calculating the
fermion determinant in a particular background. The result confirms that gauge
invariance of the effective action is respected even when large gauge
transformations are considered.
