Line Bundles Over Families of (SUPER) Riemann Surfaces. II: The Graded
  Case
</title>

<abstract>
  A relative Picard theory in the context of graded manifolds is introduced. A
Berezinian calculus and a theory of connections over SUSY-curves are
systematically developed, and used to prove a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for line
bundles in that setting and to discuss the validity of a flatness theorem
