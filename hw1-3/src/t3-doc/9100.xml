<title>
The structure of the ground ring in critical $W_3$ gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  By explicit calculation, I determine the structure of the ground ring of the
critical $W_3$ gravity and show that there is an $su(3)$ invariant quadratic
relation among the six basic elements. By using this result, I also construct
some discrete physical states of the critical $W_3$ gravity.
