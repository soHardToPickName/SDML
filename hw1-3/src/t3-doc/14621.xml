<title>
Abelian Bosonization, the Wess-Zumino Functional and Conformal Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We look at the equivalence of the massive Thirring and sine-Gordon models.
Previously, this equivalence was derived perturbatively in mass (though to all
orders). Our calculation goes beyond that and uncovers an underlying conformal
symmetry.
