Classical and Quantum Nambu Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical and quantum features of Nambu mechanics are analyzed and
fundamental issues are resolved. The classical theory is reviewed and developed
utilizing varied examples. The quantum theory is discussed in a parallel
presentation, and illustrated with detailed specific cases. Quantization is
carried out with standard Hilbert space methods. With the proper physical
interpretation, obtained by allowing for different time scales on different
invariant sectors of a theory, the resulting non-Abelian approach to quantum
Nambu mechanics is shown to be fully consistent.
