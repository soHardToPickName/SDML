Tachyon Condensation and Spectrum of Strings on D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate spectrum of open strings on D-branes after tachyon
condensation in bosonic string theory. We calculate 1-loop partition function
of the string and show that its limiting forms coincide with partition
functions of open strings with different boundary conditions.
