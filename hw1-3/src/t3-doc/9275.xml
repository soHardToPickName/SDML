Cosmological Perturbations in Brane Worlds: Brane Bending and
  Anisotropic Stresses
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a metric-based formalism to treat cosmological perturbations, we
discuss the connection between anisotropic stress on the brane and brane
bending. First we discuss gauge-transformations, and draw our attention to
gauges, in which the brane-positions remain unperturbed. We provide a unique
gauge, where perturbations both on the brane and in the bulk can be treated
with generality. For vanishing anisotropic stresses on the brane, this gauge
reduces to the generalized longitudinal gauge. We further comment on the
gravitational interaction between the branes and the bulk.
