Rotating Charged Black Strings in General Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  Einstein-Maxwell equations with a cosmological constant are analyzed in a
four dimensional stationary spacetime admitting in addition a two dimensional
group $G_2$ of spatial isometries. Charged rotating open and closed black
string solutions are found.
