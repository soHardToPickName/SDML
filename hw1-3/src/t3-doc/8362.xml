Coherent States in Null-Plane Q.E.D
</title>

<abstract>
  Light front field theories are known to have the usual infra-red divergences
of the equal time theories, as wellas new `spurious' infra-red divergences. The
formar kind of IR divergences are usually treated by giving a small mass to the
gauge particle. An alternative method to deal with these divergences is to
calculate the transition matrix elements in a coherent state basis. In this
paper we present, as a model calculation the lowest order correction to the
three point vertex in QED using a coherent state basis in the light cone
formalism. The relevant transition matrix element is shown to be free of the
true IR divergences up to $O(e^2)$.
