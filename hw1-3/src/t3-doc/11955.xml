Instanton Correction of Prepotential in Ruijsenaars Model Associated
  with N=2 SU(2) Seiberg-Witten Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Instanton correction of prepotential of one-dimensional SL(2) Ruijsenaars
model is presented with the help of Picard-Fuchs equation of Pakuliak-Perelomov
type. It is shown that the instanton induced prepotential reduces to that of
the SU(2) gauge theory coupled with a massive adjoint hypermultiplet.
