<title>
Renormalization Group in Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The running coupling constants are introduced in Quantum Mechanics and their
evolution is described by the help of the renormalization group equation. The
harmonic oscillator and the propagation on curved spaces are presented as
examples. The hamiltonian and the lagrangian scaling relations are obtained.
These evolution equations are used to construct low energy effective models.
