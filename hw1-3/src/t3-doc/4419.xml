<title>
The sine-Gordon model and the small k^+ region of light-cone
  perturbation theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-perturbative ultraviolet divergence of the sine-Gordon model is used
to study the $k^+ = 0$ region of light-cone perturbation theory. The light-cone
vacuum is shown to be unstable at the non-perturbative $\beta^2 = 8\pi$
critical point by a light-cone version of Coleman's variational method. Vacuum
bubbles, which are $k^+=0$ diagrams in light-cone field theory and are
individually finite and non-vanishing for all $\beta$, conspire to generate
ultraviolet divergences of the light-cone energy density. The $k^+ = 0$ region
of momentum also contributes to connected Green's functions; the connected two
point function will not diverge, as it should, at the critical point unless
diagrams which contribute only at $k^+ = 0$ are properly included. This
analysis shows in a simple way how the $k^+ =0$ region cannot be ignored even
for connected diagrams. This phenomenon is expected to occur in higher
dimensional gauge theories starting at two loop order in light-cone
perturbation theory.
