Constructing Bidimensional Scalar Field Theory Models From Zero Mode
  Fluctuations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we review how to reconstruct scalar field theories in two
dimensional spacetime starting from solvable Schrodinger equations. Three
different Schrodinger potentials are analyzed. We obtained two new models
starting from the Morse and Scarf II hyperbolic potentials, {\it i.e}, the
$U(\phi)=\phi^2\ln^2(\phi^2)$ model and $U(\phi)=\phi^2\cos^2(\ln(\phi^2))$
model respectively.
