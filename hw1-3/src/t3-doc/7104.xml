Discretized Light-Cone Quantization: Solving a 1+1 dimensional field
  theory (QED)
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the programming method for generating the spectrum of bound
states for relativistic quantum field theories using the nonperturbative
Hamiltonian approach of Discretized Light-Cone Quantization. The method is
intended for eventual application to quantum chromodynamics in 3+1 dimensions.
Here the fundamental principles are illustrated concretely by treatment of QED
in two dimensions. The code is intended as a basis for extensions to include
more complicated gauge symmetry groups, such as SU(3) color, and other quantum
numbers. The code was written in Fortran 77 and implemented on a DEC 5000-260
workstation with a typical runtime of 0.2s at total momentum 10.
