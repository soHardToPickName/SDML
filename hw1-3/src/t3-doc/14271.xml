On the Necessity of Rational Velocities: a Gedankenexperiment
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present contribution we propose a gedankenexperiment in which the
restriction of rational values on the velocities emerges as a necessary
condition from Classical Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics. This
restriction is shown to be intimately connected to Dirac's electric charge
quantization condition.
