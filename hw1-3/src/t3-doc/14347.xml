<title>
Pre-equilibrium evolution of non-abelian plasma
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the production and the equilibration of a non-Abelian $q\bar{q}$
plasma in an external chromoelectric field, by solving the Boltzmann equation
with the non-Abelian features explicitly incorporated. We consider the gauge
group $SU(2)$ and show that the colour degree of freedom has a major and
dominant role in the dynamics of the system. It is seen that the assumption of
the so called Abelian dominance is not justified. Finally, it is also shown
that many of the features of microscopic studies of the system appear naturally
in our studies as well.
