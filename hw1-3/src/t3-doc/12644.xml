<title>
Instantons in curvilinear coordinates
</title>

<abstract>
  The multi-instanton solutions by 'tHooft and Jackiw, Nohl & Rebbi are
generalized to curvilinear coordinates. Expressions can be notably simplified
by the appropriate gauge transformation. This generates the compensating
addition to the gauge potential of pseudoparticles. Singularities of the
compensating connection are irrelevant for physics but affect gauge dependent
quantities.
