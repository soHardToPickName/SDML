<title>
Strings from Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct models in 1+1 dimensions with chiral (0,N) supersymmetry by
taking orientifolds of type IIB on an eight-torus identified by different
numbers of reflections. The resulting models have Dirichlet strings, fivebranes
and ninebranes stretched along different directions. The cases we study in
detail have residual chiral supersymmetry (0,8), (0,4) and (0,2). The
gravitational anomaly in all cases is shown to cancel.
