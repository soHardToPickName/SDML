<title>
Covariant technique of derivative expansion of one-loop effective action
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple systematic method for calculating derivative expansions of the
one-loop effective action is presented. This method is based on using symbols
of operators and well known deformation quantization theory. To demonstrate its
advantages we present several examples of application for scalar theory,
Yang-Mills theory, and scalar electrodynamics. The superspace formulation of
the method is considered for K\"ahlerian and non-K\"ahlerian quantum
corrections for Wess-Zumino and for Heisenberg-Euler lagrangians in super QED
models.
