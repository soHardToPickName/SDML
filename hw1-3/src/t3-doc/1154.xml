(0,2) Theory and String Baryon in M-Theory on $AdS_7\times S^4$
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we consider some properties of the (0,2) theory using AdS/
CFT correspondence. We also consider the "string baryonic state" of the theory.
We will show that stable baryon states for $k$ string exist provided $2/3 N
\leq k \leq N$. The (0,2) theory in the finite temperature is also considered
using Schwarzshild geometry, giving information about the five dimensional
theory obtained at higher temperature in this background. One can also see that
there are two descriptions of a four dimensional gauge theory which become
equivalent at strong coupling and approach this five dimensional theory.
