Brane-Waves and Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, solutions of the Born-Infeld theory representing strings emanating
from a Dirichlet p-brane have been constructed. We discuss the embedding of
these Born-Infeld solutions into the non-abelian theory appropriate to multiple
overlapping p-branes. We also prove supersymmetry of the solutions explicitly
in the full nonlinear theory. We then study transverse fluctuations, both from
the worldbrane point of view and by analyzing a test-string in the supergravity
background of a Dp-brane. We find agreement between the two approaches for the
cases p=3,4.
