<title>
String Theory and the Space-Time Uncertainty Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  The notion of a space-time uncertainty principle in string theory is
clarified and further developed. The motivation and the derivation of the
principle are first reviewed in a reasonably self-contained way. It is then
shown that the nonperturbative (Borel summed) high-energy and high-momentum
transfer behavior of string scattering is consistent with the space-time
uncertainty principle. It is also shown that, in consequence of the principle,
string theories in 10 dimensions generically exhibit a characteristic length
scale which is equal to the well-known 11 dimensional Planck length
$g_s^{1/3}\ell_s$ of M-theory as the scale at which stringy effects take over
the effects of classical supergravity, even without involving D-branes
directly. The meanings of the space-time uncertainty relation in connection
with D-branes and black holes are discussed and reinterpreted. Finally, we
present a novel interpretation of the Schild-gauge action for strings from a
viewpoint of noncommutative geometry, which conforms to the space-time
uncertainty relation by manifestly exhibiting a noncommutativity of quantized
string coordinates dominantly between space and time. We also discuss the
consistency of the space-time uncertainty relation with S and T dualities.
