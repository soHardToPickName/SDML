Backreaction of excitations on a domain wall
</title>

<abstract>
  Backreaction of excitations on a planar domain wall in a real scalar field
model is investigated in the cases of homogeneous, plane wave and wave packet
type excitations. It is found that the excited domain wall radiates. The method
of calculating backreaction for the general forms of excitations is also
presented.
