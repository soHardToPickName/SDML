Mirror Symmetry Constructions: A Review
</title>

<abstract>
  We review various constructions of mirror symmetry in terms of
Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds for arbitrary central charge $c$ and \CY\
hypersurfaces and complete intersections in toric varieties. In particular it
is shown how the different techniques are related
