Loop scattering in two-dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the integrability conditions that we recently obtained in QCD$_2$ with
massless fermions, we arrive at a sufficient number of conservation laws to be
able to fix the scattering amplitudes involving a local version of the Wilson
loop operator.
