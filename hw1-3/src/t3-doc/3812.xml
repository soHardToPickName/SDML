<title>
Fine-tuning and the Wilson renormalization group
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the Wilson renormalization group (RG) formulation to solve the
fine-tuning procedure needed in renormalization schemes breaking the gauge
symmetry. To illustrate this method we systematically compute the non-invariant
couplings of the ultraviolet action of the SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory at
one-loop order.
