Regularised Supermembrane Theory and Static Configurations of M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest that the static configurations of M-theory may be described by the
matrix regularisation of the supermembrane theory in static regime. We compute
the long range interaction between a M2-brane and an anti-M2-brane in agreement
with the 11 dimensional supergravity result.
