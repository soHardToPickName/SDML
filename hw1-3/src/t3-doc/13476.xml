Fuzzy Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Regularization of quantum field theories (QFT's) can be achieved by
quantizing the underlying manifold (spacetime or spatial slice) thereby
replacing it by a non-commutative matrix model or a ``fuzzy manifold'' . Such
discretization by quantization is remarkably successful in preserving
symmetries and topological features, and altogether overcoming the
fermion-doubling problem . In this thesis, the fuzzification of coadjoint
orbits and their QFT's are put forward.
