<title>
Liouville Equation And Schottky Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  An Ansatz for the Poincar\'e metric on compact Riemann surfaces is proposed.
This implies that the Liouville equation reduces to an equation resembling a
non chiral analogous of the higher genus relationships (KP equation) arising in
the framework of Schottky's problem solution. This approach connects
uniformization (Fuchsian groups) and moduli space theories with KP hierarchy.
Besides its mathematical interest, the Ansatz has some applications in the
framework of quantum Riemann surfaces arising in 2D gravity.
