Two Loop Renormalization of Massive (p,q) Supersymmetric Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the beta-functions of the general massive (p,q) supersymmetric
sigma model to two loop order using (1,0) superfields. The conditions for
finiteness are discussed in relation to (p,q) supersymmetry. We also calculate
the effective potential using component fields to one loop order and consider
the possibility of perturbative breaking of supersymmetry. The effect of one
loop finite local counter terms and the ultra-violet behaviour of the off-shell
(p,q) models to all orders in perturbation theory are also addressed.
