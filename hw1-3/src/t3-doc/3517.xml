<title>
The Holomorphic Anomaly of Topological Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the BRS operator of the topological string B model is not
holomorphic in the complex structure of the target space. This implies that the
so-called holomorphic anomaly of topological strings should not be interpreted
as a BRS anomaly.
