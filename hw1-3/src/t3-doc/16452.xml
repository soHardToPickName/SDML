<title>
Hamiltonian formulation of nonAbelian noncommutative gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We implement the Hamiltonian treatment of a nonAbelian noncommutative gauge
theory, considering with some detail the algebraic structure of the
noncommutative symmetry group. The first class constraints and Hamiltonian are
obtained and their algebra derived, as well as the form of the gauge invariance
they impose on the first order action.
