<title>
The OSp(1|4) Superparticle and Exotic BPS States
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the dynamics of a superparticle in a superspace whose isometry is
generated by the superalgebra OSp(1|4) or its central-charge contraction. Extra
coordinates of the superspace associated with tensorial central charges are
shown to describe spin degrees of freedom of the superparticle, so quantum
states form an infinite tower of (half)-integer helicities. A peculiar feature
of the model is that it admits BPS states which preserve 3/4 of target-space
supersymmetries.
