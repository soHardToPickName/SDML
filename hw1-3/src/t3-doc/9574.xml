Tachyon mass, c-function and Counting localized degrees of freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the localized tachyon condensation in the non-supersymmetric
orbifold theories by taking the cosmological constant as the measure of degrees
of freedom (d.o.f). We first show asymptotic density of state is not a proper
quantity to count the 'localized' d.o.f. We then show that localized d.o.f lead
us a c-function given by the lightest tachyon mass, which turns out to be the
same as the tachyon potential recently suggested by Dabholkar and Vafa. We also
argue that delocalized d.o.f also encode information on the process of
localized tachyon condensation in the g-function, based on the fact that the
global geometry of the orbifolds is completely determined by the local geometry
around the fixed points. For type II, both c- and g-function respect the
stability of the supersymmetric models and both allow all the process suggested
by Adams, Polchinski and Silverstein.
