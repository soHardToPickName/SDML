<title>
Interaction of Dual N=1, D=10 Supergravity with Yang-Mills Matter
  Multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  The lagrangian of the N=1, D=10 dual supergravity interacting with the
Yang-Mills matter multiplet is constructed starting immediately from the
equations of motion obtained from the Bianchi Identities in the superspace
approach. The difference is established in comparison with the Gates-Nishino
lagrangian at the fourth order level in fermionic fields.
