<title>
On the Geometry of the Quantum Poincare Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the construction of the multiparametric inhomogeneous orthogonal
quantum group ISO_qr(N) as a projection from SO_qr(N+2), and recall the
conjugation that for N=4 leads to the quantum Poincare group. We study the
properties of the universal enveloping algebra U_qr(iso(N)), and give an
R-matrix formulation. A quantum Lie algebra and a bicovariant differential
calculus on twisted ISO(N) are found.
