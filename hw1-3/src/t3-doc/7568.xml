The Stochastic Quantization Method in Phase Space and a New Gauge Fixing
  Procedure
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the stochastic quantization of the system with first class
constraints in phase space. Though the Langevin equations of the canonical
variables are defined without ordinary gauge fixing procedure, gauge fixing
conditions are automatically selected and introduced by imposing stochastic
consistency conditions upon the first class constraints. Then the equilibrium
solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is identical with corresponding path
integral distribution.
