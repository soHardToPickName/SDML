<title>
Dual Anti-de Sitter Superalgebras from Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  The partial breaking of supersymmetry in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space can be
accomplished using two of four dual representations for the massive OSp(1,4)
spin-3/2 multiplet. The representations can be ``unHiggsed,'' which gives rise
to a set of dual N=2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.
