Structures Symplectiques sur les Espaces de Courbes Projectives et
  Affines
</title>

<abstract>
  A symplectic structure on the space of nondegenerate and nonparametrized
curves in a locally affine manifold is defined. We also consider several
interesting spaces of nondegenerate projective curves endowed with Poisson
structures. This construction connects the Virasoro algebra and the
Gel'fand-Dikii bracket with the projective differential geometry.
