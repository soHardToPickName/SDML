<title>
Classical and Thermodynamic Stability of Black Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that many non-extremal black branes exhibit a classical
Gregory-Laflamme instability if, and only if, they are locally
thermodynamically unstable. For some black branes, the Gregory-Laflamme
instability must therefore disappear near extremality. For the black $p$-branes
of the type II supergravity theories, the Gregory-Laflamme instability
disappears near extremality for $p=1,2,4$ but persists all the way down to
extremality for $p=5,6$ (the black D3-brane is not covered by the analysis of
this paper). This implies that the instability also vanishes for the
near-extremal black M2 and M5-brane solutions.
