<title>
A comment on the 4D antisymmetric tensor field model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show the existence of a renormalizable local supersymmetry for the gauge
fixed action of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor field model in a
curved background quantized in a generalized axial gauge. By using the
technique of the algebraic renormalization procedure, we prove the ultraviolet
finiteness of the model to all orders of perturbation theory.
