Properties Of Heterotic Vacua From Superpotentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the superpotential for the heterotic string compactified on
non-Kahler complex manifolds. We show that many of the geometrical properties
of these manifolds can be understood from the proposed superpotential. In
particular we give an estimate of the radial modulus of these manifolds. We
also show, how the torsional constraints can be obtained from this
superpotential.
