New N=1 Superconformal Field Theories and their Supergravity Description
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we construct a new class of superconformal field theories as
mass deformed N=4 super Yang-Mills theories. We will argue that these theories
correspond to the fixed points which were recently found by Khavaev, Pilch and
Warner studying the deformations of the dual IIB string theory on AdS_5\times
S^5.
