Rolling among G_2 vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider topology-changing transitions between 7-manifolds of holonomy G_2
constructed as a quotient of CY x S^1 by an antiholomorphic involution. We
classify involutions for Complete Intersection CY threefolds, focussing
primarily on cases without fixed points. The ordinary conifold transition
between CY threefolds descends to a transition between G_2 manifolds,
corresponding in the N=1 effective theory incorporating the light black hole
states either to a change of branch in the scalar potential or to a Higgs
mechanism. A simple example of conifold transition with a fixed nodal point is
also discussed. As a spin-off, we obtain examples of G_2 manifolds with the
same value for the sum of Betti numbers b_2+b_3, and hence potential candidates
for mirror manifolds.
