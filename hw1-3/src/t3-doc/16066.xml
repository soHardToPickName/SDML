<title>
Diff invariant Poincare transformations as deformation of Poincare
  algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The concept of $Diff^4$ invariant Poincare transformations is a cornerstone
of T(opological) G(eometro)D(ynamics). This concept makes it possible to
understand the concept of subjective time and irreversibelity as well as
nontriviality of S-matrix at quantum level. In this paper the possibility of
identifying $Diff^4$ invariant Poincare transformations as the recently
discovered Lorentz invariant deformation of Poincare algebra with the basic
property that 'new' energy is some function of 'old' energy, is considered.
