<title>
Casimir Effect on the Radius Stabilization of the Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the one-loop correction to the spectrum of Kaluza-Klein system
for the $\phi^3$ model on $R^{1,d}\times (T_\theta^2)^L$, where $1+d$
dimensions are the ordinary flat Minkowski spacetimes and the extra dimensions
are the L two-dimensional noncommutative tori with noncommutativity $\theta$.
The correction to the Kaluza-Klein mass spectrum is then used to compute the
Casimir energy. The results show that when $L>2$ the Casimir energy due to the
noncommutativity could give repulsive force to stabilize the extra
noncommutative tori in the cases of $d = 4n - 2$, with $n$ a positive integral.
