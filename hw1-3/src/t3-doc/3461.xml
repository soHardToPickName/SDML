Supermanifolds, Rigid Manifolds and Mirror Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  By providing a general correspondence between Landau-Ginzburg orbifolds and
non-linear sigma models, we find that the elusive mirror of a rigid manifold is
actually a supermanifold. We also discuss when sigma models with super-target
spaces are conformally invariant and describe their chiral rings. Both
supermanifolds with and without Kahler moduli are considered. This work leads
us to conclude that mirror symmetry should be viewed as a relation among
super-varieties rather than bosonic varieties.
