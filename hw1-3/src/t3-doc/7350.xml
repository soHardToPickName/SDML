<title>
Quantum Deformations of Space-Time Symmetries with Mass-Like Deformation
  Parameter
</title>

<abstract>
  The difficulties with the measurability of classical space-time distances are
considered. We outline the framework of quantum deformations of D=4 space-time
symmetries with dimensionfull deformation parameter, and present some recent
results.
