<title>
Spectral sum rules and finite volume partition function in gauge
  theories with real and pseudoreal fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the chiral symmetry breaking pattern and the corresponding
low-energy effective lagrangian, we determine the fermion mass dependence of
the partition function and derive sum rules for eigenvalues of the QCD Dirac
operator in finite Euclidean volume. Results are given for $N_c = 2$ and for
Yang-Mills theory coupled to several light adjoint Majorana fermions. They
coincide with those derived earlier in the framework of random matrix theory.
