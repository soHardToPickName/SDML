<title>
On some local properties of Yang-Mills vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we use a non-covariant gauge which makes some of the YM
features manifest which otherwise do not appear explicitly in the Landau gauge
used by Nielsen and Olesen.We show, in fact, that the unstable mode which makes
a large contribution to the vacuum energy is non-perturbative even classically.
