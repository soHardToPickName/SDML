Quantum Mechanical Interaction-Free Measurements
</title>

<abstract>
  A novel manifestation of nonlocality of quantum mechanics is presented. It is
shown that it is possible to ascertain the existence of an object in a given
region of space without interacting with it. The method might have practical
applications for delicate quantum experiments.
