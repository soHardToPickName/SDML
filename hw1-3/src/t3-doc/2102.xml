<title>
Spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave background
</title>

<abstract>
  Models of string cosmology predict a stochastic background of gravitational
waves with a spectrum that is strongly tilted towards high frequencies. I give
simple approximate expressions for spectral densities of the cosmic background
which can be directly compared with sensitivities of gravitational wave
detectors.
