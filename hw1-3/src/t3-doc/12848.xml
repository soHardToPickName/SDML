<title>
On the convergence of the usual perturbative expansions
</title>

<abstract>
  The study of the convergence of power series expansions of energy eigenvalues
for anharmonic oscillators in quantum mechanics differs from general
understanding, in the case of quasi-exactly solvable potentials. They provide
examples of expansions with finite radius and suggest techniques useful to
analyze more generic potentials.
