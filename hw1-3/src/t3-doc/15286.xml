<title>
A Covariant Formulation of Classical Spinning Particle
</title>

<abstract>
  Covariantly we reformulate the description of a spinning particle in terms of
the Poincar\'{e} group. We also construct a Lagrangian which entails all
possible constraints explicitly; all constraints can be obtained just from the
Lagrangian. Furthermore, in this covariant reformulation, the Lorentz element
is to be considered to evolve the momentum or spin component from an arbitrary
fixed frame and not just from the particle rest frame. In distinction with the
usual formulation, our system is directly comparable with the pseudo-classical
formulation. We get a peculiar symmetry which resembles the supersymmetry of
the pseudo-classical formulation.
