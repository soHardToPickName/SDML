Supersymmetry on the Surface S_2
</title>

<abstract>
  By using symplectic Majorana spinors as Grassmann coordinates in a superspace
associated with the supersymmetric extension of the isometry group on the
spherical surface S_2, it proves possible to formulate supersymmetric models on
S_2 using superspace techniques.
