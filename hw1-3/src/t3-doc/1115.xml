<title>
String amplitudes in arbitrary dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate gravitational dressed tachyon correlators in non critcal
dimensions. The 2D gravity part of our theory is constrained to constant
curvature. Then scaling dimensions of gravitational dressed vertex operators
are equal to their bare conformal dimensions. Considering the model as d+2
dimensional critical string we calculate poles of generalized Shapiro-Virasoro
amplitudes.
