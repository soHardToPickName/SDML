<title>
Renormalization of the Hamiltonian and a geometric interpretation of
  asymptotic freedom
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a novel approach to renormalization in the Hamiltonian formalism, we
study the connection between asymptotic freedom and the renormalization group
flow of the configuration space metric. It is argued that in asymptotically
free theories the effective distance between configuration decreases as high
momentum modes are integrated out.
