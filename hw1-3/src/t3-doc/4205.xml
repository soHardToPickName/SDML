<title>
A brief history of hidden quantum symmetries in Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We review briefly a stream of ideas concerning the role of quantum groups as
hidden symmetries in conformal field theories, paying particular attention to
the field theoretical representations of quantum groups based on Coulomb gas
methods. An extensive bibliography is also included.
