<title>
Vector-Tensor Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  A dynamical non-abelian two-form potential gives masses to vector bosons via
a topological coupling. Unlike in the abelian case, the two-form cannot be
dualized to Goldstone bosons. Duality is restored by coupling a flat connection
to the theory in a particular way, and the new action is then dualized to a
non-linear sigma model. The presence of the flat connection is crucial, which
saves the original mechanism of Higgs-free topological mass generation from
being dualized to a sigma model.
