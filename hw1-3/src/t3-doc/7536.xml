<title>
The commutativity principle and lagrangian symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the commutativity of a general variation with the time differentiation
we discuss both global and local (gauge) symmetries of a lagrangian from a
unified point of view. The Noether considerations are thereby applicable for
both cases. A complete equivalence between the hamiltonian and lagrangian
formulations is established.
