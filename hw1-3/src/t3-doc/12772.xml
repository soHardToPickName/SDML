<title>
Local BRST cohomology for p-form gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In this thesis, we compute within the field-antifield formalism the local
BRST cohomology of various theories involving p-form gauge fields. A particular
emphasis is put on the cohomology groups corresponding to the consistent local
interactions, counterterms and candidate anomalies.
