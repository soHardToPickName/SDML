Chirality and Dirac Operator on Noncommutative Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a derivation of the Dirac operator on the noncommutative $2$-sphere
within the framework of the bosonic fuzzy sphere and define Connes' triple. It
turns out that there are two different types of spectra of the Dirac operator
and correspondingly there are two classes of quantized algebras. As a result we
obtain a new restriction on the Planck constant in Berezin's quantization. The
map to the local frame in noncommutative geometry is also discussed.
