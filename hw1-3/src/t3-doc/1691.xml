<title>
Representation theory of Code VOA and construction of VOAs
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a vertex operator algebra containing a tensor product of Ising
models. It is a direct sum of code vertex operator algebra and its irreducible
modules. Therefore, we classify all irreducible modules of code vertex operator
algebras and show a new construction of vertex operator algebras.
