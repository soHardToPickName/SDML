Smirnov's Integrals and Quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov Equation of Level
  $0$
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation of level $0$ associated
with the spin $1/2$ representation of $U_q \bigl(\widehat{\frak s \frak l
_{2}}\bigr)$. We find an integral formula for solutions in the case of an
arbitrary total spin and $|q|<1$. In the formula, different solutions can be
obtained by taking different integral kernels with the cycle of integration
being fixed.
