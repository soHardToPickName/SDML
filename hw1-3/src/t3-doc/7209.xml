<title>
Gauge field localization on Abelian vortices in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The vector and tensor fluctuations of vortices localizing gravity in the
context of the six-dimensional Abelian Higgs model are studied. These
string-like solutions break spontaneously six-dimensional Poincar\'e invariance
leading to a finite four-dimensional Planck mass and to a regular geometry both
in the bulk and on the core of the vortex. While the tensor modes of the metric
are decoupled and exhibit a normalizable zero mode, the vector fluctuations,
present in the gauge sector of the theory, are naturally coupled to the
graviphoton fields associated with the vector perturbations of the warped
geometry. Using the invariance under infinitesimal diffeomorphisms, it is found
that the zero modes of the graviphoton fields are never localized. On the
contrary,the fluctuations of the Abelian gauge field itself admit a
normalizable zero mode.
