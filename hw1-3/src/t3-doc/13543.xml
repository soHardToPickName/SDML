Domain Wall Junctions in Supersymmetric Field Theories in D=4
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the possible BPS domain wall junction configurations for general
polynomial superpotentials of N=1 supersymmetric Wess-Zumino models in D=4. We
scan the parameter space of the superpotential and find different possible BPS
states for different values of the deformation parameters and present our
results graphically. We comment on the domain walls in F/M/IIA theories
obtained from the Calabi-Yau fourfolds with isolated singularities and a
background flux.
