<title>
On algebraic equations satisfied by hypergeometric correlators in WZW
  models. II
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an explicit description of "bundles of conformal blocks" in
Wess-Zumino-Witten models of Conformal field theory and prove that integral
representations of Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations constructed earlier by the
second and third authors are in fact sections of these bundles.
