Boundary States for D-branes in $AdS_3$
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct boundary states representing D-strings in $AdS_3$. These wrap
twisted conjugacy classes of SL(2,R), and the boundary states are therefore
based on continuous representations only. We check Cardy's condition and find a
consistent open string spectrum. The open string spectrum on all the D-branes
is the same.
