</title>

<abstract>
  Contribution to the Proceedings of the International Congress of
Mathematicians 1994. We review recent developments in the physics and
mathematics of Yang-Mills theory in two dimensional spacetimes. This is a
condensed version of a forthcoming review by S. Cordes, G. Moore, and S.
Ramgoolam.
