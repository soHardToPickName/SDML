Open Dielectric Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive leading terms in the effective actions describing the coupling of
bulk supergravity fields to systems of arbitrary numbers of Dp-branes and
D(p+4)-branes in type IIA/IIB string theory. We use these actions to
investigate the physics of Dp-D(p+4) systems in the presence of weak background
fields. In particular, we construct various solutions describing collections of
Dp-branes blown up into open D(p+2)-branes ending on D(p+4)-branes. The
configurations are stabilized by the presence of background fields and
represent an open-brane analogue of the Myers dielectric effect. To deduce the
D-brane actions, we use supersymmetry to derive operators corresponding to
moments of various conserved currents in the Berkooz-Douglas matrix model of
M-theory in the presence of longitudinal M5-branes and then use dualities to
relate these operators to the worldvolume operators appearing in the
Dp-D(p+4)-brane effective actions.
