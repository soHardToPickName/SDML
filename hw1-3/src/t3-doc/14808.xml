<title>
Calculating the infrared central charges for perturbed minimal models:
  improving the RG perturbation
</title>

<abstract>
  We illustrate a method for improving Renormalisation Group improved
perturbation theory by calculating the infrared central charge of a perturbed
conformal field theory. The additional input is a dispersion relation that
exploits analyticity of the energy-momentum tensor correlator.
