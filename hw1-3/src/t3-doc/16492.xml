<title>
Spectra of Conformal Field Theories with Current Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an elementary review of our recent work on the classification of the
spectra of those two-dimensional rational conformal field theories (RCFTs)
whose (maximal) chiral algebras are current algebras. We classified all
possible partition functions for such theories when the defining
finite-dimensional Lie algebra is simple. The concepts underlying this work are
emphasized, and are illustrated using simple examples.
