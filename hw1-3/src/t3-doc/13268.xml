Yangians and Classical Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We study in detail the structure of the Yangian Y(gl(N)) and of some new
Yangian-type algebras called twisted Yangians. The algebra Y(gl(N)) is a
`quantum' deformation of the universal enveloping algebra U(gl(N)[x]), where
gl(N)[x] is the Lie algebra of gl(N)-valued polynomial functions. The twisted
Yangians are quantized enveloping algebras of certain twisted Lie algebras of
polynomial functions which are naturally associated to the B, C, and D series
of the classical Lie algebras.
