D-Branes on a gauged WZW model
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebraic classification of Cardy for boundary states on a $G/H$ coset
CFT of a compact group G, is geometrically realized on the corresponding
manifold resulting from gauging the WZW model. The branes consist of H orbits
of quantized G conjugacy classes shifted by quantized H conjugacy classes.
