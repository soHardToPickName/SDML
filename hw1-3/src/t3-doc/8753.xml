Singletons and Logarithmic CFT in ADS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a possible relation between singletons in $AdS$ space and
logarithmic conformal field theories at the boundary of $AdS$. It is shown that
the bulk Lagrangian for singleton field (singleton dipole) induces on the
boundary the two-point correlation function for logarithmic pair. Bulk
interpretation of mixing between logarithmic operator $D$ and zero mode
operator $C$ under the scale transformation is discussed as well as some other
issues.
