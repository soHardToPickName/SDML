Diffeomorphisms and Holographic Anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the relation between diffeomorphisms in the bulk and Weyl
transformations on the boundary we study the Weyl transformation properties of
the bulk metric on shell and of the boundary action. We obtain a universal
formula for one of the classes of trace anomalies in any even dimension in
terms of the parameters of the gravity action.
