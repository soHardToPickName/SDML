A General Expression for Symmetry Factors of Feynman Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  The calculation of the symmetry factor corresponding to a given Feynman
diagram is well known to be a tedious problem. We have derived a simple formula
for these symmetry factors. Our formula works for any diagram in scalar theory
($\phi^3$ and $\phi^4$ interactions), spinor QED, scalar QED, or QCD.
