<title>
Massive fields dynamics in open bosonic string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the theory of open bosonic string in massive background fields.
The general structure of renormalization is investigated. A general covariant
action for a string in background fields of the first massive level is
suggested and its symmetries are described. Equations of motion for the
background fields are obtained by demanding that the renormalized operator of
the energy-momentum tensor trace vanishes.
