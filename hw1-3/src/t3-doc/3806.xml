Some Issues in Noncommutative Solitons as D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate and interpret a large class of soliton solutions found in
noncommutative tachyon condensation. These constructions make extensive use of
the idea that Dp-branes may be built out of lower dimensional branes. Finally
we comment on a recently proposed solution generating technique.
