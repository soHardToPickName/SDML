AdS(3) x R as a target space for the (2,1) string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a target space geometry of the form $AdS_3 \times {\bf R}$ for the
$(2,1)$ heterotic string. This target space arises as the near horizon limit of
a solitonic configuration in 2+2 dimensions. We investigate the null isometries
of this space and discuss the reduction to 1+1 dimensions of the target space
geometry arising from the consistent gauging of one of these isometries.
