Non-BPS String Junctions and Dyons in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct non-BPS dyon solutions of N=4 SU(n) supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory. These solutions are the worldvolume solitons which describe non-BPS
Type IIB non-planar string junctions connecting n parallel D3-branes. The
solutions are smooth deformations of the 1/4 BPS states which describe planar
string junctions.
