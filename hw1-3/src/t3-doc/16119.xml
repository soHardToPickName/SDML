Chaotic Quantization: Maybe the Lord plays dice, after all?
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the quantized non-Abelian gauge theory can be obtained as the
infrared limit of the corresponding classical gauge theory in a higher
dimension. We show how the transformation from classical to quantum field
theory emerges, and calculate Planck's constant from quantities defined in the
underlying classical gauge theory.
