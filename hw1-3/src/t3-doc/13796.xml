Functional Relations and Analytic Bethe Ansatz for Twisted Quantum
  Affine Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Functional relations are proposed for transfer matrices of solvable vertex
models associated with the twisted quantum affine algebras
$U_q(X^{(\kappa)}_n)$ where $X^{(\kappa)}_n = A^{(2)}_n, D^{(2)}_n, E^{(2)}_6$
and $D^{(3)}_4$. Their solutions are obtained for $A^{(2)}_n$ and conjectured
for $D^{(3)}_4$ in the dressed vacuum form in the analytic Bethe ansatz.
