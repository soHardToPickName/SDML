<title>
Couplings of self-dual tensor multiplet in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The (1,0) supersymmetry in six dimensions admits a tensor multiplet which
contains a second-rank antisymmetric tensor field with a self-dual field
strength and a dilaton. We describe the fully supersymmetric coupling of this
multiplet to Yang-Mills multiplet, in the absence of supergravity. The
self-duality equation for the tensor field involves a Chern-Simons modified
field strength, the gauge fermions, and an arbitrary dimensionful parameter.
