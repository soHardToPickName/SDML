<title>
Extra dimensions and self-organizing criticality
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a possible explanation of the hierarchy problem within the
theories with spacetime dimensions higher than four. We show that the presence
of relatively (not hierarchically) large extra dimensions can significantly
alter the evolution of the Higgs field VEV, driving it to an infrared stable
fixed point $\sim M_{W}$. Such a behaviour results in self-organizing
criticality and naturally explains gauge hierarchy without any fine tuning of
the parameters.
