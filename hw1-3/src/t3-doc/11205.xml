A Representation of Symmetry Generators for the Type IIB Superstring on
  a Plane Wave in the U(4) Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the symmetry currents for the type IIB superstring on a
maximally supersymmetric plane wave background using the N=(2,2)
superconformally covariant U(4) formulation developed by Berkovits, Maldacena
and Maoz. An explicit realization of the U(4) generators together with 16
fermionic generators is obtained in terms of the N=(2,2) worldsheet fields.
Because the action is no longer quadratic, we use a light-cone version to
display the currents in terms of the covariant worldsheet variables.
