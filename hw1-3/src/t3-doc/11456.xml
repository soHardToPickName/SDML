Open and Closed Universes in Brane-World Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We find two types [called (S) and (A)] of new vacuum solutions of open, flat,
and closed universes which are inflating in the brane-world scenario. We show
that the warp factor of the stabilized metric is universal for the three
different kinds of universes. For (S) type solution, we show that one
positive-tension brane universe solution is admitted as well as two positive
tension brane solution even if we consider the vacuum solution. For (A) type
solution, we find that the inflating bulk solutions have black hole like
regions and that the full extended space is the R-S solution.
