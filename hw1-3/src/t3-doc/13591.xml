<title>
Towards understanding structure of the monopole clusters
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider geometrical characteristics of monopole clusters of the lattice
SU(2) gluodynamics. We argue that the polymer approach to the field theory is
an adequate means to describe the monopole clusters. Both finite-size and the
infinite, or percolating clusters are considered. We find out that the
percolation theory allows to reproduce the observed distribution of the
finite-size clusters in their length and radius. Geometrical characteristics of
the percolating cluster reflect, in turn, the basic properties of the ground
state of a system with a gap.
