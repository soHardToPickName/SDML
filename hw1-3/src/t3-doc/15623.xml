Rotating Brane World Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A five dimensional rotating black string in a Randall-Sundrum brane world is
considered. The black string intercepts the three brane in a four dimensional
rotating black hole. The geodesic equations and the asymptotics in this
background are discussed.
