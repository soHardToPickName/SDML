Linear Models of Supersymmetric D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a class of supersymmetric boundary interactions in N=2 field
theories on the half-space, which depend on parameters that are not at all
renormalized or not renormalized in perturbation theory beyond one-loop. This
can be used to study D-branes wrapped on a certain class of Lagrangian
submanifolds as well as holomorphic cycles. The construction of holomorphic
D-branes is in close relationship with the background independent open string
field theory approach to brane/anti-brane systems. As an application, mirror
pairs of Lagrangian and holomorphic D-branes are identified. The mirror pairs
are studied by twisting to open topological field theories.
