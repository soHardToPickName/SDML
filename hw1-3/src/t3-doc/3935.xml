M Theory from World-Sheet Defects in Liouville String
</title>

<abstract>
  We have argued previously that black holes may be represented in a D-brane
approach by monopole and vortex defects in a sine-Gordon field theory model of
Liouville dynamics on the world sheet. Supersymmetrizing this sine-Gordon
system, we find critical behaviour in 11 dimensions, due to defect condensation
that is the world-sheet analogue of D-brane condensation around an extra
space-time dimension in M theory. This supersymmetric description of
Liouville dynamics has a natural embedding within a 12-dimensional framework
suggestive of F theory.
