<title>
Inflation, Quantum Cosmology and the Anthropic Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  Anthropic principle can help us to understand many properties of our world.
However, for a long time this principle seemed too metaphysical and many
scientists were ashamed to use it in their research. I describe here a
justification of the weak anthropic principle in the context of inflationary
cosmology and suggest a possible way to justify the strong anthropic principle
using the concept of the multiverse.
