<title>
Classical Yang-Mills Vacua on $T^{3}$ : Explicit Constructions
</title>

<abstract>
  Flat connections for unitary gauge groups on a 3--torus with twisted boundary
conditions as well as recently discovered periodic nontrivial flat connections
with ``nondiagonalizable'' triples of holonomies for higher orthogonal and
exceptional groups are constructed explicitly in terms of Jacobi theta
functions with rational characteristics. The (fractional) Chern-Simons numbers
of these vacuum gauge field configurations are verified by direct computation.
