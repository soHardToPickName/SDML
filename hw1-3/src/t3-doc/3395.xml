A Derivation of K-Theory from M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how some aspects of the K-theory classification of RR fluxes follow
from a careful analysis of the phase of the M-theory action. This is a
shortened and simplified companion paper to ``E8 Gauge Theory, and a Derivation
of K-Theory from M-Theory.''
