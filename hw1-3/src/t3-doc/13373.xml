Black hole formation in bidimensional dilaton gravity coupled to scalar
  matter systems
</title>

<abstract>
  This work deals with the formation of black hole in bidimensional dilaton
gravity coupled to scalar matter fields. We investigate two scalar matter
systems, one described by a sixth power potential and the other defined with
two scalar fields containing up to the fourth power in the fields. The
topological solutions that appear in these cases allow the formation of black
holes in the corresponding dilaton gravity models.
