<title>
Tunnelling Effects in a Brane System and Quantum Hall Physics
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that a system of interacting D-branes, generalizing a recent
proposal, can be modelled as a Quantum Hall fluid. We show that tachyon
condensation in such a system is equivalent to one particle tunnelling. In a
conformal field theory effective description, that induces a transition from a
theory with central charge c=2 to a theory with c=3/2, with a corresponding
symmetry enhancement.
