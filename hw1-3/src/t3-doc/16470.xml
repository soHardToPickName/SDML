<title>
Replica Field Theory for Deterministic Models: Binary Sequences with Low
  Autocorrelation
</title>

<abstract>
  We study systems without quenched disorder with a complex landscape, and we
use replica symmetry theory to describe them. We discuss the
Golay-Bernasconi-Derrida approximation of the low autocorrelation model, and we
reconstruct it by using replica calculations. Then we consider the full model,
its low $T$ properties (with the help of number theory) and a Hartree-Fock
resummation of the high-temperature series. We show that replica theory allows
to solve the model in the high $T$ phase. Our solution is based on one-link
integral techniques, and is based on substituting a Fourier transform with a
generic unitary transformation. We discuss this approach as a powerful tool to
describe systems with a complex landscape in the absence of quenched disorder.
