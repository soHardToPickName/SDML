Superfield algorithms for topological field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A superfield algorithm for master actions of a class of gauge field theories
including topological ones in arbitrary dimensions is presented generalizing a
previous treatment in two dimensions. General forms for master actions in
superspace are given, and possible theories are determined by means of a ghost
number prescription and the master equations. The resulting master actions
determine the original actions together with their gauge invariances.
Generalized Poisson sigma models in arbitrary dimensions are constructed by
means of this algorithm, and other applications in low dimensions are given
including the Chern-Simon model.
