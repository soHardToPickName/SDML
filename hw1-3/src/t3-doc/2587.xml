Light Monopoles, Electric Vortices and Instantons

<abstract>
  The physics of the bare Seiberg-Witten action, without supersymmetric
partners, is considered in the framework of standard Quantum Field Theory. The
topological analysis related to the solutions of the Seiberg-Witten equations
is performed and the phase structure of the model is analysed.
