<title>
2D quantum dilaton gravitational Hamiltonian, boundary terms and new
  definition for total energy
</title>

<abstract>
  The ADM and Bondi mass for the RST model have been first discussed from
Hawking and Horowitz's argument. Expressing the localized RST action in terms
of the ADM formulation, the RST Hamiltonian can be derived, meanwhile keeping
track of all boundary terms. Then the total boundary terms can be taken as the
total energy for the RST model. It has been found that there is a new
contribution to the ADM and Bondi mass from the RST boundary due to the
existence of the hidden dynamical field. The ADM and Bondi mass have been
discussed respectively in detail, and some new properties have been found.
