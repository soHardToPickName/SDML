<title>
On gravitational dressing of renormalization group beta-functions beyond
  lowest order of perturbation theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on considerations in conformal gauge I derive up to nextleading order a
relation between the coefficients of beta-functions in 2D renormalizable field
theories before and after coupling to gravity. The result implies a coupling
constant dependence of the ratio of both beta-functions beyond leading order.
