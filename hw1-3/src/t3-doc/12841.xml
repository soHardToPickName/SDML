Strings in Nontrivial Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we discuss deformations of the BRST operator of the fermionic
string. These deformations preserve nilpotency of the BRST operator and
correspond to turning on infinitesimal Gravitino and Ramond-Ramond spacetime
fields.
