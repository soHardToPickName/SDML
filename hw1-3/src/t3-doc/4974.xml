Boundary S Matrix for the XXZ Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute by means of the Bethe Ansatz the boundary S matrix for the open
anisotropic spin-1/2 chain with diagonal boundary magnetic fields in the
noncritical regime (Delta > 1). Our result, which is formulated in terms of
q-gamma functions, agrees with the vertex-operator result of Jimbo et al.
