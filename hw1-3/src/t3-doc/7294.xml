<title>
Algebraic structure of the Green's ansatz and its q-deformed analogue
</title>

<abstract>
  The algebraic structure of the Green's ansatz is analyzed in such a way that
its generalization to the case of q-deformed para-Bose and para-Fermi operators
is becoming evident. To this end the underlying Lie (super)algebraic properties
of the parastatistics are essentially used.
