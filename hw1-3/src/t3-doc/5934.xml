<title>
Chiral stabilization of the renormalization group for flavor and color
  anisotropic current interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an all-orders beta function for current-current interactions in 2d
with flavor anisotropy. When the number of left-moving and right-moving flavors
are unequal, the beta function has a non-trivial fixed point at finite values
of the couplings. We also extend the computation to simple cases with both
flavor and color anisotropy.
