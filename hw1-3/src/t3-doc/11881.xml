<title>
The Vacuum Structure and Spectrum of N=2 Supersymmetric SU(N) Gauge
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an exact description of the metric on the moduli space of vacua
and the spectrum of massive states for four dimensional N=2 supersymmetric
SU(n) gauge theories. The moduli space of quantum vacua is identified with the
moduli space of a special set of genus n-1 hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces.
