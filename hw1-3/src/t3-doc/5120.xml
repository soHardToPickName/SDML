<title>
The exponential map of GL(N)
</title>

<abstract>
  A finite expansion of the exponential map for a $N\times N$ matrix is
presented. The method uses the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for writing the higher
matrix powers in terms of the first N-1 ones. The resulting sums over the
corresponding coefficients are rational functions of the eigenvalues of the
matrix.
