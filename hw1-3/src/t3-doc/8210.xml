Domain Walls in the Large N Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We study BPS saturated domain walls in supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills
theories in the large N limit. We focus on the Seiberg-Witten regime of ${\cal
N}=2$ theory perturbed by a small mass ($m<O(\Lambda/N^4)$) and determine the
wall profile by numerically minimizing its energy density. Similar to the SU(2)
wall studied in a previous work, the SU(N) wall has a five layer structure,
with two confinement phases on the outside, a Coulomb phase in the middle and
two transition regions.
