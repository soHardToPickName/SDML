<title>
Integrable quantum field theories with OSP(m/2n) symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture the factorized scattering description for OSP(m/2n)/OSP(m-1/2n)
supersphere sigma models and OSP(m/2n) Gross Neveu models. The non-unitarity of
these field theories translates into a lack of `physical unitarity' of the S
matrices, which are instead unitary with respect to the non-positive scalar
product inherited from the orthosymplectic structure. Nevertheless, we find
that formal thermodynamic Bethe ansatz calculations appear meaningful,
reproduce the correct central charges, and agree with perturbative
calculations. This paves the way to a more thorough study of these and other
models with supergroup symmetries using the S matrix approach.
