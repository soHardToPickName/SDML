Universal Spectral Correlators and Massive Dirac Operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the large-N spectral correlators of complex matrix ensembles with
weights that in the context of Dirac spectra correspond to N_f massive
fermions, and prove that the results are universal in the appropriate scaling
limits. The resulting microscopic spectral densities satisfy exact spectral sum
rules of massive Dirac operators in QCD.
