Quantum Chains with U_q(SL(2)) Symmetry and Unrestricted Representations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two-state (q^2=-1) and three-state (q^3=1) one-dimensional
quantum spin chains with U_q(SL(2)) symmetry. Taking unrestricted
representations (periodic, semi-periodic and nilpotent), we show which are the
necessary conditions to obtain a Hermitian Hamiltonian.
