<title>
Smallest Dirac Eigenvalue Distribution from Random Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the hole probability and the distribution of the smallest
eigenvalue of chiral hermitian random matrices corresponding to Dirac operators
coupled to massive quarks in QCD. They are expressed in terms of the QCD
partition function in the mesoscopic regime. Their universality is explicitly
related to that of the microscopic massive Bessel kernel.
