Statistical Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Strings and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The statistical entropy of a Schwarzschild black string in five dimensions is
obtained by counting the black string states which form a representation of the
near-horizon conformal symmetry with a central charge. The statistical entropy
of the string agrees with its Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as that of the
Schwarzschild black hole in four dimensions. The choice of the string length
which gives the Virasoro algebra also reproduces the precise value of the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and lies inside the stability bound of the string.
