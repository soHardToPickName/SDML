<title>
Statistical Entropy of Four-Dimensional Extremal Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory is used to count microstates of four-dimensional extremal black
holes in compactifications with $N=4$ and $N=8$ supersymmetry. The result
agrees for large charges with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.
