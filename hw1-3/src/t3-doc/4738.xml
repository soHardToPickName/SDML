<title>
Noncommutative instantons revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We find a new gauge in which U(1) noncommutative instantons are explicitly
non-singular on the whole noncommutative R^4, thus resolving the previous
confusions of the author. We start with the pedagogical introduction to the
noncommutative gauge theories.
