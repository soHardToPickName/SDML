Dynamics of BPS States in the Dirac-Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Dirac-Born-Infeld action with transverse scalar fields is considered to
study the dynamics of various BPS states. We first describe the characteristic
properties of the so-called 1/2 and 1/4 BPS states on the D3 brane, which can
be interpreted as F/D-strings ending on a D3-brane in Type IIB string theory
picture. We then study the response of the BPS states to low energy excitations
of massless fields on the brane, the scalar fields representing the shape
fluctuation of the brane and U(1) gauge fields describing the open string
excitations on the D-brane. This leads to an identification of interactions
between BPS states including the static potentials and the kinetic
interactions.
