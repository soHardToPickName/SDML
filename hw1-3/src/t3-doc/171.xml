Field Configurations and the SU(2) Haar Measure in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We characterise a class of SU(2) gluonic field configurations in the modified
axial gauge where a zero mode component vanishes at some space point but the
global Haar measure remains non-zero. The consequence of this is that gluonic
wavefunctionals need not vanish at the boundary of the fundamental modular
domain, which itself permits $\theta$ dependence in QCD(3+1).
