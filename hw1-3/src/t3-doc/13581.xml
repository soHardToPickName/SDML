Negative Energies on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been proposed that our universe is a three-brane embedded in
a higher dimensional spacetime. Here I show that black holes on the brane,
black strings intersecting the brane, and gravitational waves propagating in
the bulk induce an effective energy-momentum tensor on the brane that contains
negative energy densities.
