<title>
Schr\"odinger Functional and Quantization of Gauge Theories in the
  Temporal Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In the language of Feynman path integrals the quantization of gauge theories
is most easily carried out with the help of the Schr\"odinger Functional (SF).
Within this formalism the essentially unique gauge fixing condition is
$A_{\circ} = 0$ (temporal gauge), as any other rotationally invariant gauge
choice can be shown to be functionally equivalent to the former. In the
temporal gauge Gauss' law is automatically implemented as a constraint on the
states. States not annihilated by the Gauss operator describe the situation in
which external (infinitely heavy) colour sources interact with the gauge field.
The SF in the presence of an arbitrary distribution of external colour sources
can be expressed in an elegant and concise way.
