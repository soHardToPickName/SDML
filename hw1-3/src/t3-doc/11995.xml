<title>
Difficulties in a Kind of Averaging Procedure for Constructing
  Gauge-invariant Operators out of Gauge-variant Ones
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that a kind of averaging procedure for constructing gauge-invariant
operators(or functionals) out of gauge-variant ones is erroneous and
inapplicable for a large class of operators(or functionals).
