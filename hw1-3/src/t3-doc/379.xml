Singularity Resolution in Gauged Supergravity and Conifold Unification
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a unified picture for the conifold singularity resolution. We
propose that gauged supergravity, through a novel prescription for the
twisting, provides an appropriate framework to smooth out singularities in the
context of gravity duals of supersymmetric gauge theories.
