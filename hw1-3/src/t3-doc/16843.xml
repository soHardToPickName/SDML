Vacuum String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a brief review of vacuum string field theory, a new approach to open
string field theory based on the stable vacuum of the tachyon. We discuss the
sliver state explaining its role as a projector in the space of half-string
functionals. We review the construction of D-brane solutions in vacuum string
field theory, both in the algebraic approach and in the more general
geometrical approach that emphasizes the role of boundary CFT. -- To appear in
the Proceedings of Strings 2001, Mumbai, India.
