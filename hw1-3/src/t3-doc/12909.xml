Two-point function reduction of four-point amputated functions and
  transformations in $F\bar{F}$ and RA basis in a real-time finite
  temperature NJL model
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a general analysis of Green functions in the real-time thermal field
theory, we have proven that the four-point amputated functions in a NJL model
in the fermion bubble diagram approximation behave like usual two-point
functions. We expound the thermal transformations of the matrix propagator for
a scalar bound state in the $F\bar{F}$ basis and in the $RA$ basis. The
resulting physical causal, advanced and retarded propagator are respectively
identical to corresponding ones derived in the imaginary-time formalism and
this shows once again complete equivalence of the two formalisms of thermal
field theory on the discussed problem in the NJL model.
