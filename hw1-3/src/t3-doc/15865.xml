<title>
Multi-spin correlation functions for the Z-Invariant Ising model
</title>

<abstract>
  Continuing our work hep-th/9609135 where a explicit formula for the two-point
functions of the two dimensional Z-invariant Ising model were found. I obtain
here different results for the higher correlation functions and several
consistency checks are done.
