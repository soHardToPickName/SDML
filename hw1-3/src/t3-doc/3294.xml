<title>
Quantum mechanics of higher derivative systems and total derivative
  terms
</title>

<abstract>
  A general theory is presented of quantum mechanics of singular,
non-autonomous, higher derivative systems. Within that general theory, $n$-th
order and $m$-th order Lagrangians are shown to be quantum mechanically
equivalent if their difference is a total derivative.
