On solving Schwinger-Dyson equations for non-Abelian gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A method for solving Schwinger-Dyson equations for the Green function
generating functional of non-Abelian gauge theory is proposed. The method is
based on an approximation of Schwinger-Dyson equations by exactly soluble
equations. For the SU(2) model the first step equations of the iteration scheme
are solved which define a gauge field propagator. Apart from the usual
perturbative solution, a non-perturbative solution is found which corresponds
to the spontaneous symmetry breaking and obeys infrared finite behaviour of the
propagator.
