Self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills in the context of
  Macdowell-Mansouri formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we propose an action which unifies self-dual gravity and
self-dual Yang-Mills in the context of the Macdowell-Mansouri formalism. We
claim that such an action may be used to find the S-dual action for both
self-dual gravity and self-dual Yang-Mills.
