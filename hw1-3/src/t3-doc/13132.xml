Toward a Field Theoretical Description of Topologically Linked Polymers
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work a field theoretical model is constructed to describe the
statistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymers
in the context of the analytical approach of Edwards. As an application, the
effects of the topological interactions are studied in the one loop
approximation. A natural way to include in the treatment also more
sophisticated link invariants than the Gauss linking number is outlined.
