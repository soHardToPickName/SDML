<title>
Functional Schroedinger and BRST Quantization of (1+1)--Dimensional
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the quantization of pure string--inspired dilaton--gravity in
$(1+1)$--dimensions, and of the same theory coupled to scalar matter. We
perform the quantization using the functional Schroedinger and BRST formalisms.
We find, both for pure gravity and the matter--coupled theory, that the two
quantization procedures give inequivalent ``physical'' results.
