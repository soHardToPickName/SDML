<title>
On direct and crossed channel asymptotics of four-point functions in
  AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the leading logarithmic singularities in direct and crossed
channel limit of the four-point functions in dilaton-axion sector of type IIB
supergravity on $AdS_{5}$ in AdS/CFT correspondence. Logarithms do not cancel
in the full correlator in both channels.
