Volume Preserving Diffeomorphism and Noncommutative Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a representation of the volume preserving diffeomorphism of $\bR^p$
in terms of the noncommutative (p-2)-branes whose kinetic term is described by
the Hopf term. In the static gauge, the (p-2)-brane can be described by the
free fields and it suggests that the quantization of the algebra is possible.
