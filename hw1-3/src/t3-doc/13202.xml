<title>
Lagrangian for the Majorana-Ahluwalia Construct
</title>

<abstract>
  The equations describing self/anti-self charge conjugate states, recently
proposed by Ahluwalia, are re-written to covariant form. The corresponding
Lagrangian for the neutral particle theory is proposed. From a
group-theoretical viewpoint the construct is an example of the
Nigam-Foldy-Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type quantum field theory based on the
doubled representations of the extended Lorentz group. Relations with the
Sachs-Schwebel and Ziino-Barut concepts of relativistic quantum theory are
discussed.
