Strings on Orbifold Lines
</title>

<abstract>
  The orbifold lines IIA/I_8 and IIB/$I_8 (-1)^{F_L} possess BPS discrete
torsion variants which carry fundamental string (NSNS) charge. We show that
these variants are actually classified by an integral electric field F from the
twisted RR sector, and compute their tension and NSNS charge as a function of
F. The analysis employs equivariant K-theory and the string creation
phenomenon. The K-theory results demonstrate the corrections to cohomology in
the case of torsion; it is found that 8 units of F are invisible at transverse
infinity for IIA, and correspondingly 16 units for IIB.
