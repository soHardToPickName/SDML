<title>
Delocalized membrane model
</title>

<abstract>
  A model considered in the paper generalizes membrane theory to the case of
delocalized membranes. The model admits covariant formulation, which involves
no constraints. It generalizes the notion of membrane to the case of smooth
distribution of non-intersecting membranes. A generalization of p-brane
solution with delocalized membranes is presented.
