<title>
$U_q(sl(n))$ Difference Operator Realization
</title>

<abstract>
  A unified and systematic scheme for constraction of differential opreator
realization of any irreducible representation of $sl(n)$ is developed. The
$q$-analogue of this unified scheme is used to constract $q$-difference
operator realization of any irreducible representation of $U_q(sl(n))$.
Explicit results for $U_q(sl(2))$, $U_q(sl(3))$ and $U_q(sl(n))$ are given.
