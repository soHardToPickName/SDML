<title>
String from Large N Gauge Fields via Graph Summation on a P+ - x+
  Lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  I describe renewed efforts to establish a string description of large N_c QCD
by summing large ``fishnet'' diagrams. Earlier work on fishnets indicated that
the usual relativistic (zero thickness) string theory can arise at strong 't
Hooft coupling, at best yielding a highly idealized description, which fails to
incorporate such salient features of continuum QCD as asymptotic freedom and
point-like constituents. The recently conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence is
compatible with such limitations because it also gives a simple picture of
large N_c gauge theory only at strong coupling. In order to better understand
how string theory could emerge from large N_c QCD at strong coupling, Klaus
Bering, Joel Rozowsky, and I have developed an improved implementation of my
effort of the late seventies to digitize the planar diagrams of large N_c
light-cone quantized QCD by discretizing both P+ and x+. This discretization
allows a strong coupling limit of the sum of planar diagrams to be defined and
studied. It also provides a natural framework to explore the possible dual
relationship between QCD in light-cone gauge and string theory quantized on the
light-cone.
