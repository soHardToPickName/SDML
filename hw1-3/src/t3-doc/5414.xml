Logarithmic Operators Fold D branes into AdS_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We use logarithmic conformal field theory techniques to describe recoil
effects in the scattering of two Dirichlet branes in D dimensions. In the
particular case that a D1 brane strikes a D3 brane perpendicularly, thereby
folding it, we find that the recoil space-time is maximally symmetric, with
AdS_3 x E_{D-3} geometry. We comment on the possible applications of this
result to the study of transitions between different background metrics.
