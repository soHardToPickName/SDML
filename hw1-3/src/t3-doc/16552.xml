GRAMA. A Mathematica program for analytical calculations in
  10-dimensional supergravity. Version 1.0
</title>

<abstract>
  "GRAMA" is a Mathematica package for doing symbolic tensor computations and
complicated algebraic manipulations in 10-dimensional (D=10) simple (N=1)
supergravity. The main new ingredients of this package inside the general
Mathematica environment are the computation of complicated products of Dirac
matrices and the treatment of covariant derivatives: spinorial and vectorial.
In principle, with small modifications, GRAMA can also be used for calculations
in 4-dimensional supergravity. With the help of this package we were able to
obtain the equations of motion and the Lagrangian for the 10-D supergravity
including superstring corrections (see hep-th/9507033) - a calculation that
would be otherwise impossible to perform. "GRAMA" is designed as a community-
and user-friendly program.
