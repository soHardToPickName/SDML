Mellin-Barnes Representation for the Genus-g Finite Temperature String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Mellin-Barnes representation for the free energy of the genus-$g$ string
is constructed. It is shown that the interactions of the open bosonic string do
not modify the critical (Hagedorn) temperature. However,for the sectors having
a spinor structure, the critical temperature exists also for all $g$ and
depends on the windings. The appearance of a periodic structure is briefly
discussed.
