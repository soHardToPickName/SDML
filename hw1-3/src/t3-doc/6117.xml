<title>
QED in external fields, a functional point of view
</title>

<abstract>
  A functional partial differential equation is set for the proper graphs
generating functional of QED in external electromagnetic fields. This equation
leads to the evolution of the proper graphs with the external field amplitude
and the external field gauge dependence of the complete fermion propagator and
vertex is derived non-perturbativally.
