<title>
de Sitter entropy from conformal field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that the entropy of de Sitter space can be identified with the
mutual entropy of a dual conformal field theory. We argue that unitary time
evolution in de Sitter space restricts the total number of excited degrees of
freedom to be bounded by the de Sitter entropy, and we give a CFT
interpretation of this restriction. We also clarify issues arising from the
fact that both de Sitter and anti de Sitter have dual descriptions in terms of
conformal field theory.
