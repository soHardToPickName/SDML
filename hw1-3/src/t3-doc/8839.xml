Electric-Magnetic Duality Invariant Lagrangians
</title>

<abstract>
  We find general non-linear lagrangians of a U(1) field invariant under
electric-magnetic duality. They are characterized by an arbitrary function and
go to the Maxwell theory in the weak field limit. We give some explicit
examples which are generalizations of the Born-Infeld theory.
