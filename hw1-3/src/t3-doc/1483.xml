<title>
A Bohmian Interpretation for Noncommutative Quantum Field Theory and
  Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop Bohmian interpretations for noncommutative quantum field theory
and quantum mechanics. The conditions for the classical and commutative limits
for both theories are derived and applied for a formal discussion of the
quantum/classical and noncommutative/commutative passages. Classical field
theory and Newtonian mechanics are obtained as limit cases of noncommutative
quantum field theory and noncommutative quantum mechanics. Some advantages of
the Bohmian interpretation against the orthodox one are underlined. An
application of the theory for the noncommutative harmonic oscillator is
presented and worked out in detail
