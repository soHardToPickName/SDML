<title>
Monte Carlo Simulations of 2-Dimensional Quantum Gravity Coupled to $c =
  1$ Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We present results of a high precision Monte Carlo simulation of dynamically
triangulated random surfaces (up to $\approx$ 34,000 triangles) coupled to one
scalar field ($c=1$). The mean square extent has been measured for different
actions to test the universality of the leading term as a function of the size
of the surfaces. Furthermore, the integrated 2-point correlation function for
vertex operators is compared with conformal field theory and matrix model
predictions.
