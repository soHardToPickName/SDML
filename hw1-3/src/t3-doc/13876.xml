<title>
Supergravity duals of gauge field theories from SU(2) x U(1) gauged
  supergravity in five dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the SO(4)-symmetric solution of the five-dimensional SU(2) x U(1)
gauged N=4 supergravity theory obtained in [hep-th/0101202]. This solution
contains purely magnetic non-Abelian and electric Abelian fields. It can be
interpreted as a reduction of seven-dimensional gauged supergravity on a torus,
which comes from type IIB supergravity on S^3. We also show how to obtain that
solution from six-dimensional Romans' theory on a circle. We then up-lift the
solution to massless type IIA supergravity. The dual gauge field theory is
twisted and is defined on the worldvolume of a NS-fivebrane wrapped on S^3. Two
other spatial directions of the NS-fivebrane are on a torus. In the IR limit it
corresponds to a three-dimensional gauge field theory with two supercharges.
