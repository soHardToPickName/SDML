<title>
Bailey flows and Bose-Fermi identities for the conformal coset models
  $(A^{(1)}_1)_N\times (A^{(1)}_1)_{N'}/(A^{(1)}_1)_{N+N'}$
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the recently established higher-level Bailey lemma and Bose-Fermi
polynomial identities for the minimal models $M(p,p')$ to demonstrate the
existence of a Bailey flow from $M(p,p')$ to the coset models
$(A^{(1)}_1)_N\times (A^{(1)}_1)_{N'}/(A^{(1)}_1)_{N+N'}$ where $N$ is a
positive integer and $N'$ is fractional, and to obtain Bose-Fermi identities
for these models. The fermionic side of these identities is expressed in terms
of the fractional-level Cartan matrix introduced in the study of $M(p,p')$.
Relations between Bailey and renormalization group flow are discussed.
