Symmetric Instantons and Skyrme Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  By explicit construction of the ADHM data, we prove the existence of a charge
seven instanton with icosahedral symmetry. By computing the holonomy of this
instanton we obtain a Skyrme field which approximates the minimal energy charge
seven Skyrmion. We also present a one parameter family of tetrahedrally
symmetric instantons whose holonomy gives a family of Skyrme fields which
models a Skyrmion scattering process, where seven well-separated Skyrmions
collide to form the icosahedrally symmetric Skyrmion.
