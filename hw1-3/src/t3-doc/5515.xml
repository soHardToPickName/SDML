<title>
Large N Strong/Weak Coupling Phase Transition and the Correspondence
  Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the large N strong/weak phase transition is a generic
phenomenon in a finite temperature supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory of maximal
supersymmetry. ${\cal N}=4$, D=4 SYM is the canonical example, where we also
argue that the large N Hawking-Page phase transition disappears for a
sufficiently small coupling. The Hawking-Page transition temperature is lowered
by the first $\ap$ correction. Physically, the strong/weak phase transition is
identified with the correspondence point of Horowitz and Polchinski. We also
try to construct toy models to demonstrate the large N phase transitions, with
limited success.
