BRST Analysis of Physical States in Two-Dimensional Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the BRST cohomology for $SL(2,R)/U(1)$ coset model, which describes
an exact string black hole solution. It is shown that the physical spectrum
could contain not only the extra discrete states corresponding to those in
$c=1$ two-dimensional gravity but also many additional new states with ghost
number $N_{FP}= -1 \sim 2$. We also discuss characters for nonunitary
representations and the relation of our results to other approaches.
