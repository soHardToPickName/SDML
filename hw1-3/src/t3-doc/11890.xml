Imprints of Short Distance Physics On Inflationary Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the impact of certain modifications to short distance physics on
the inflationary perturbation spectrum. For the specific case of power-law
inflation, we find distinctive -- and possibly observable -- effects on the
spectrum of density perturbations.
