<title>
Selfdual backgrounds in N=2 five-dimensional Chern-Simons Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider five-dimensional S(2,2|N) Chern-Simons supergravity on M_4 * R .
By fine-tuning the Kaluza-Klein reduction to make the 4d cosmological constant
equal zero, it is shown that selfdual curvatures on M_4 provide exact solutions
to the equations of motion if N=2.
