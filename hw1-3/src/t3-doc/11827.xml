Recovering Infinities in Graviton Scattering Amplitudes using Cutkosky
  rules
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the Cutkosky rules as a tool for determining the infinities present in
graviton scattering amplitudes. We are able to confirm theoretical derivations
of counterterms in Einstein-Maxwell theory and to determine new results in the
Dirac-Einstein counter-Lagrangian.
