Comments on the Riemann conjecture and index theory on Cantorian fractal
  space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  An heuristic proof of the Riemman conjecture is proposed. It is based on the
old idea of Polya-Hilbert. A discrete/fractal derivative self adjoint operator
whose spectrum may contain the nontrivial zeroes of the zeta function is
presented. To substantiate this heuristic proposal we show using generalized
index-theory arguments, corresponding to the (fractal) spectral dimensions of
fractal branes living in Cantorian-fractal space-time, how the required
$negative$ traces associated with those derivative operators naturally agree
with the zeta function evaluated at the spectral dimensions. The $\zeta (0) = -
1/2$ plays a fundamental role. Final remarks on the recent developments in the
proof of the Riemann conjecture are made.
