<title>
Infinite Dimensional Geometry and Quantum Field Theory of Strings. II.
  Infinite Dimensional Noncommutative Geometry of a Self-Interacting String
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometric interpretation of quantum self-interacting string field theory is
given. Relations between various approaches to the second quantization of an
interacting string are described in terms of the geometric quantization. An
algorithm to construct a quantum nonperturbative interacting string field
theory in the quantum group formalism is proposed. problems of a metric
background (in)dependence are discussed.
