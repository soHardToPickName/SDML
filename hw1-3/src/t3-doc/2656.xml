The Perturbative Gross Neveu Model Coupled to a Chern-Simons Field: A
  Renormalization Group Study
</title>

<abstract>
  In 2+1 dimensions, for low momenta, using dimensional renormalization we
study the effect of a Chern-Simons field on the perturbative expansion of
fermions self interacting through a Gross Neveu coupling. For the case of just
one fermion field, we verify that the dimension of operators of canonical
dimension lower than three decreases as a function of the Chern-Simons
coupling.
