Exact Solutions of Kemmer Equation for Coulomb Potential
</title>

<abstract>
  This article illustrates the bound states of Kemmer equation for spin-1
particles. The asymptotic, exact and Coulomb field solutions are obtained by
using action principle. In the conclusion the energy spectrum of spin-1
particles moving in a Coulomb potential compared with the energy spectrum of
spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles.
