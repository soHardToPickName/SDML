Euler Hierarchies and Universal Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Finite Euler hierarchies of field theory Lagrangians leading to universal
equations of motion for new types of string and membrane theories and for {\it
classical} topological field theories are constructed. The analysis uses two
main ingredients. On the one hand, there exists a generic finite Euler
hierarchy for one field leading to a universal equation which generalises the
Plebanski equation of self-dual four dimensional gravity. On the other hand,
specific maps are introduced between field theories which provide a
``triangular duality'' between certain classes of arbitrary field theories,
classical topological field theories and generalised string and membrane
theories. The universal equations, which derive from an infinity of
inequivalent Lagrangians, are generalisations of certain reductions of the
Plebanski and KdV equations, and could possibly define new integrable systems,
thus in particular integrable membrane theories. Some classes of solutions are
constructed in the general case. The general solution to some of the universal
equations is given in the simplest cases.
