<title>
Observables of Non-Commutative Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct gauge invariant operators in non-commutative gauge theories
which in the IR reduce to the usual operators of ordinary field theories (e.g.
F^2). We show that in the deep UV the two-point functions of these operators
admit a universal exponential behavior which fits neatly with the dual
supergravity results. We also consider the ratio between n-point functions and
two-point functions to find exponential suppression in the UV which we compare
to the high energy fixed angle scattering of string theory.
