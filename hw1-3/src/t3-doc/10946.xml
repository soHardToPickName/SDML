Exact String Theory Instantons by Dimensional Reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  We identify exact gauge-instanton-like solutions to (super)-string theory
using the method of dimensional reduction. We find in particular the Polyakov
instanton of 3d QED, and a class of generalized Yang-Mills merons. We discuss
their marginal deformations, and show that for the $3d$ instanton they
correspond to a dissociation of vector- and axial-magnetic charges.
