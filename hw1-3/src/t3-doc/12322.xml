<title>
On the equivalence of the self-dual and Maxwell-Chern-Simons models
  coupled to Fermions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the exact equivalence between the self-dual model minimally coupled
with a Dirac field and the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model with non-minimal magnetic
coupling to fermions. We show that the fermion sectors of the models are
equivalent only if a Thirring like interaction is included. Using functional
methods we verify that, up to renormalizations, the equivalence persists at the
quantum level.
