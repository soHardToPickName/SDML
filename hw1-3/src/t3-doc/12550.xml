<title>
On the Space-Time Uncertainty Principle and Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note further evidence is collected in support of the claim that the
space-time uncertainty principle implies holography, both within the context of
Matrix Theory and the framework of the proposed duality between certain
conformal field theories and M-theory/string theory on AdS backgrounds.
