A Geometric Realization of Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the geometric realization of the Higgs phenomenon in type II string
compactifications on Calabi--Yau manifolds. The string description is most
directly phrased in terms of confinement of magnetic flux, with magnetic
charged states arising from D-branes wrapped around chains as opposed to
cycles. The rest of the closed cycle of the D-brane worldvolume is manifested
as a confining flux tube emanating from the magnetic charges, in the
uncompactified space. We also study corrections to hypermultiplet moduli for
type II compactifications, in particular for type IIA near the conifold point.
