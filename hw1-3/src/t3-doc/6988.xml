<title>
Anyon Statistics and the Witten Index
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the theory of supersymmetric anyons, I extend the definition of the
Witten index to 2+1 dimensions so as to accommodate the existence of anyon spin
and statistics. I then demonstrate that, although in general the index receives
irrational and complex contributions from anyonic states, the overall index is
always integral, and I consider some of the implications and interpretations of
this result.
