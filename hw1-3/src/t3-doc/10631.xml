<title>
Generalized Action Principle and Geometric Approach for superstrings and
  super-p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short printed version of my talk I consider the generalized action
for super-p-branes proposed previously in collaboration with D. Sorokin and
Dmitrij V. Volkov. I describe briefly, the derivation doubly supersymmetric
geometric approach from the generalized action and discuss one of the direction
of its possible application.
