<title>
Asymptotic symmetries of AdS2 Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  I analyze the asymptotic symmetries of a theory of gravity in a background
consisting of two patches of ${\rm AdS}_3$ spacetime glued together along an
${\rm AdS}_2$ brane. These are generated by a single Virasoro algebra, as
expected from the conjectured dual description in terms of a scale-invariant
interface separating two conformal field theories. Contributed to the
proceedings of the Francqui Colloquium 2001: `Strings and Gravity: Tying the
Forces Together .'
