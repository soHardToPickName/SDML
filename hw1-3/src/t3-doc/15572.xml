<title>
Scale Anomaly and Quantum Chaos in the Billiards with Pointlike
  Scatterers
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the random-matrix like energy spectra found in pseudointegrable
billiards with pointlike scatterers are related to the quantum violation of
scale invariance of classical analogue system. It is shown that the behavior of
the running coupling constant explains the key characteristics of the level
statistics of pseudointegrable billiards.
