Counting BPS States via Holomorphic Anomaly Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Gromov-Witten invariants of a rational elliptic surface using
holomorphic anomaly equation in [HST1](hep-th/9901151). Formulating invariance
under the affine $E_8$ Weyl group symmetry, we determine conjectured
invariants, the number of BPS states, from Gromov-Witten invariants. We also
connect our holomorphic anomaly equation to that found by
Bershadsky,Cecotti,Ooguri and Vafa [BCOV1](hep-th/9302103).
