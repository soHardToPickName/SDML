<title>
Open string models with Scherk-Schwarz SUSY breaking and localized
  anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  We study examples of chiral four-dimensional IIB orientifolds with
Scherk--Schwarz supersymmetry breaking, based on freely acting orbifolds. We
construct a new Z3xZ3' model, containing only D9-branes, and rederive from a
more geometric perspective the known Z6'xZ2' model, containing D9, D5 and \bar
D 5 branes. The cancellation of anomalies in these models is then studied
locally in the internal space. These are found to cancel through an interesting
generalization of the Green--Schwarz mechanism involving twisted Ramond--Ramond
axions and 4-forms. The effect of the latter amounts to local counterterms from
a low-energy effective field theory point of view. We also point out that the
number of spontaneously broken U(1) gauge fields is in general greater than
what expected from a four-dimensional analysis of anomalies.
