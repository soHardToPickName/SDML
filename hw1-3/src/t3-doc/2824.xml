<title>
Study of Quommutators of Quantum Variables and Generalized Derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  A general deformation of the Heisenberg algebra is introduced with two
deformed operators instead of just one. This is generalised to many variables,
and permits the simultaneous existence of coherent states, and the
transposition of creation operators.
