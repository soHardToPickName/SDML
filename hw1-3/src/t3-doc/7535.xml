<title>
Einstein manifolds and conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In light of the AdS/CFT correspondence, it is natural to try to define a
conformal field theory in a large N, strong coupling limit via a supergravity
compactification on the product of an Einstein manifold and anti-de Sitter
space. We consider the five-dimensional manifolds T^{pq} which are coset spaces
(SU(2) x SU(2))/U(1). The central charge and a part of the chiral spectrum are
calculated, respectively, from the volume of T^{pq} and the spectrum of the
scalar laplacian. Of the manifolds considered, only T^{11} admits any
supersymmetry: it is this manifold which characterizes the supergravity
solution corresponding to a large number of D3-branes at a conifold
singularity, discussed recently in hep-th/9807080. Through a field theory
analysis of anomalous three point functions we are able to reproduce the
central charge predicted for the T^{11} theory by supergravity: it is 27/32 of
the central charge of the N=2 Z_2 orbifold theory from which it descends via an
RG flow.
