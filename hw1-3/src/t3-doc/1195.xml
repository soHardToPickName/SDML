<title>
Confinement and Chiral Dynamics in the Multi-flavor Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional QED with $N$ flavor fermions is solved at zero and finite
temperature with arbitrary fermion masses to explore QCD physics such as chiral
condensate and string tension. The problem is reduced to solving a
Schr\"odinger equation for $N$ degrees of freedom with a specific potential
determined by the ground state of the Schr\"odinger problem itself.
