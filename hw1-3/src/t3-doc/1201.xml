Aspects of D-brane actions
</title>

<abstract>
  A couple of issues concerning the effective dynamics of D-branes in string
theory are discussed. Primarily, I am concerned with linearization of the
actions by introduction of non-propagating fields and a full super- and
kappa-symmetric description of D-branes.
