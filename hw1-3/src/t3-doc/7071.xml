<title>
The Orbifolds of N=2 Superconformal Theories with c=3
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct Z_M, M= 2, 3, 4, 6 orbifold models of the N=2 superconformal
field theories with central charge c=3. Then we check the description of the
Z_3, Z_4 and Z_6 orbifolds by the N=2 superconformal Landau-Ginzburg models
with c=3, by comparing the spectrum of chiral fields, in particular the Witten
index Tr(-1)^F.
