A New Basis Function Approach to 't Hooft Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the new basis functions to investigate the 't Hooft equation, the
lowest order mesonic Light-Front Tamm-Dancoff equation for $\rm SU(N_C)$ gauge
theories. We find the wave function can be well approximated by new basis
functions and obtain an analytic formula for the mass of the lightest bound
state. Its value is consistent with the precedent results.
