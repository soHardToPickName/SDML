<title>
Universal Hidden Supersymmetry in Classical Mechanics and its Local
  Extension
</title>

<abstract>
  We review here a path-integral approach to classical mechanics and explore
the geometrical meaning of this construction. In particular we bring to light a
universal hidden BRS invariance and its geometrical relevance for the Cartan
calculus on symplectic manifolds. Together with this BRS invariance we also
show the presence of a universal hidden genuine non-relativistic supersymmetry.
In an attempt to understand its geometry we make this susy local following the
analogous construction done for the supersymmetric quantum mechanics of Witten.
