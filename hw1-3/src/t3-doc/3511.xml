Quantum Groups and Quantum Field Theory in Rindler Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum Field Theory (QFT) developed in Rindler space-time and its thermal
properties are analyzed by means of quantum groups approach. The quantum
deformation parameter, labelling the unitarily inequivalent representations,
turns out to be related to the acceleration of the Rindler frame.
