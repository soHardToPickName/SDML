AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence at finite temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  The AdS/CFT correspondence is established for the AdS_3 space compactified on
a solid torus with the CFT field on the boundary. Correlation functions that
correspond to the bulk theory at finite temperature are obtained in the
regularization a'la Gubser, Klebanov, and Polyakov. The BTZ black hole
solutions in AdS_3 are T-dual to the solution in the AdS_3 space without
singularity.
