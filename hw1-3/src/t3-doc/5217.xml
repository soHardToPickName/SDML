Tiling with almost-BPS states
</title>

<abstract>
  In the light of recent studies of BPS triple junctions in the Wess-Zumino
model we describe techniques to construct infinite lattices using similar
junctions. It is shown that whilst these states are only approximately locally
BPS they are nevertheless stable to small perturbations, giving a metastable
tiling of the plane.
