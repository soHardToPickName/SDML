Noncommutativity in a Time-Dependent Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute a time-dependent noncommutativity parameter in a model with a
time-dependent background, a space-time metric of the plane wave type supported
by a Neveu-Schwarz two-form potential. This model is the open string version of
the WZW model based on a non-semi-simple group previously studied by Nappi and
Witten. Like its closed string counterpart, it is exactly conformally
invariant. We quantize the sigma-model in light-cone gauge, compute the
worldsheet propagator, and use it to derive the noncommutativity parameter.
