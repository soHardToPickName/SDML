<title>
Solution of the Thirring Model with Imaginary Mass and Massless
  Scattering
</title>

<abstract>
  The Thirring model with imaginary mass (or the sine-Gordon model with
imaginary coupling) is deeply related to all the flows between minimal
conformal theories. We solve this model explicitely using the Bethe ansatz. We
find that there are Left and Right moving massless excitations with non trivial
LR scattering. We compute the S matrix and recover the result conjectured by
Fendley et al.
