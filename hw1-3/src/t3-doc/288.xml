Relativistically Invariant Description of Fluctuations Against the
  Background of Classical Kink Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  A relativistically invariant scheme for the description of excited states in
a one-kink sector is formulated. The normal oscillations of fluctuations
against the background of a moving kink are determined. Zero mode of these
oscillations is excluded automatically due to the properties of the integral
equation describing normal oscillations. A Hamiltonian for elementary
excitations is obtained reflecting the relativistic nature of the problem
considered. (35 kb)
