<title>
Deformed Poincare Algebra and Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine deformed Poincar\'e algebras containing the exact Lorentz algebra.
We impose constraints which are necessary for defining field theories on these
algebras and we present simple field theoretical examples. Of particular
interest is a case that exhibits improved renormalization properties.
