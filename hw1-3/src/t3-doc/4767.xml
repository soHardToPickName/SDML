A Proposal for the Wrapped Transverse Five Brane in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a state in 5+1 super Yang-Mills theory which corresponds to the
wrapped transverse five brane of M(atrix) theory on $T^5$. This state is a
magnetic flux quantized in units of $1/g_6^2$ through a plane defined by one
side of the box and a new direction which is not manifest.
