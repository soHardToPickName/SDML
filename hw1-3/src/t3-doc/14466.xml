<title>
Thermodynamic Partition Function of Matrix Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, in the limit of zero string coupling, $g_s \to 0$, the
thermodynamic partition function of matrix string theory is identical to that
of the finite temperature, discrete light-cone quantised (DLCQ) type IIA
superstring. We discuss how the superstring is recovered in the decompactified
$R^+\to\infty$ limit.
