Probing Five-Dimensional Black Holes with D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a one-brane probe in the presence of a five-dimensional black
hole in the classical limit. The velocity-dependent force on a slowly-moving
probe is characterized by a metric on the probe moduli space. This metric is
computed for large black holes using low-energy supergravity, and for small
black holes using D-brane gauge theory. The results are compared.
