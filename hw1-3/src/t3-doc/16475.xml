<title>
dS/CFT correspondence on a brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study branes moving in an AdS Schwarzschild black hole background. When
the brane tension exceeds a critical value, the induced metric on the brane is
of FRW type and asymptotically de Sitter. We discuss the relevance of such
configurations to dS/CFT correspondence. When the black hole mass reaches a
critical value that depends on the brane tension, the brane interpolates in the
infinite past and future between a dS space and a finite space of zero Hubble
constant. This corresponds to a cosmological evolution without a Big Bang or a
Big Crunch. Moreover, the central charge of the CFT dual to the dS brane enters
the Cardy-Verlinde formula that gives the entropy of the thermal CFT dual to
the bulk AdS black hole.
