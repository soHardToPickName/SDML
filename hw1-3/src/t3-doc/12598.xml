1/4 BPS solutions in massive IIA supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study four kinds of 1/4 BPS solutions in massive IIA supergravity
corresponding to D8-D0-F1, D8-D2, D8-D4 and D8-D6-NS5 systems. We show that
these solutions are reproduced without making nontrivial assumptions by using
supersymmetry conditions. D8-D2 and D8-D4 solutions are represented by harmonic
functions, as usual, while the other two are represented by solutions of
non-linear differential equations. Because these four solutions can be treated
in almost identical ways, we mainly focus on the D8-D6-NS5 systems. We first
discuss D6-NS5 solutions with uniform mass parameters. Then, we introduce
D8-branes as domain walls by connecting two solutions with different values of
the mass parameter. We also discuss boundary conditions and supersymmetry on
domain walls.
