Generalized Poisson sigma models
</title>

<abstract>
  A general master action in terms of superfields is given which generates
generalized Poisson sigma models by means of a natural ghost number
prescription. The simplest representation is the sigma model considered by
Cattaneo and Felder. For Dirac brackets considerably more general models are
generated.
