Moyal Nahm Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Various aspects of the Nahm equations in 3 and 7 dimensions are investigated.
The residues of the variables at simple poles in the 7-dimensional case form an
algebra. A large class of matrix representations of this algebra is
constructed. The large $N$ limit of these equations is taken by replacing the
commutators by Moyal Brackets, and a set of non trivial solutions in a
generalised form of Wigner distribution functions is obtained.
