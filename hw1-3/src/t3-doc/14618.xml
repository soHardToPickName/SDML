Calorons in Weyl Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate by explicit construction that while the untwisted
Harrington-Shepard caloron $A_\mu$ is manifestly periodic in Euclidean time,
with period $\beta=\frac{1}{T}$, when transformed to the Weyl ($A_0=0$) gauge,
the caloron gauge field $A_i$ is periodic only up to a large gauge
transformation, with winding number equal to the caloron's topological charge.
This helps clarify the tunneling interpretation of these solutions, and their
relation to Chern-Simons numbers and winding numbers.
