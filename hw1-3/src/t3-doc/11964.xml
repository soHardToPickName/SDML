QCD, Wick's Theorem for KdV $\tau$-functions and the String Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  Two consistency conditions for partition functions established by Akemann and
Dam-gaard in their studies of the fermionic mass dependence of the QCD
partition function at low energy ({\it a la} Leutwiller-Smilga-Verbaarschot)
are interpreted in terms of integrable hierarchies. Their algebraic relation is
shown to be a consequence of Wick's theorem for 2d fermionic correlators
(Hirota identities) in the special case of the 2-reductions of the KP hierarchy
(that is KdV/mKdV). The consistency condition involving derivatives is an
incarnation of the string equation associated with the particular matrix model
(the particular kind of the Kac-Schwarz operator).
