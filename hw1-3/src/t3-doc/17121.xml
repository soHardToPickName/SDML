Dual D-Brane Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  Dual super Dp-brane actions are constructed by carrying out a duality
transformation of the world-volume U(1) gauge field. The resulting world-volume
actions, which contain a (p - 2)-form gauge field, are shown to have the
expected properties. Specifically, the D1-brane and D3-brane transform in ways
that can be understood on the basis of the SL(2, Z) duality of type IIB
superstring theory. Also, the D2-brane and the D4-brane transform in ways that
are expected on the basis of the relationship between type IIA superstring
theory and 11d M theory. For example, the dual D4-brane action is shown to
coincide with the double-dimensional reduction of the recently constructed
M5-brane action. The implications for gauge-fixed D-brane actions are discussed
briefly.
