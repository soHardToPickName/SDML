<title>
Non-Localizability and Asymptotic Commutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  The mathematical formalism commonly used in treating nonlocal highly singular
interactions is revised. The notion of support cone is introduced which
replaces that of support for nonlocalizable distributions. Such support cones
are proven to exist for distributions defined on the Gelfand-Shilov spaces
$S^\beta$, where $0<\beta <1$ . This result leads to a refinement of previous
generalizations of the local commutativity condition to nonlocal quantum
fields. For string propagators, a new derivation of a representation similar to
that of K\"{a}llen-Lehmann is proposed. It is applicable to any initial and
final string configurations and manifests exponential growth of spectral
densities intrinsic in nonlocalizable theories.
