Generalised chiral QED2 : Anomaly and Exotic Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the influence of the anomaly on the physical quantum picture of the
generalized chiral Schwinger model defined on the circle. We show that the
anomaly i) results in the background linearly rising electric field and ii)
makes the spectrum of the physical Hamiltonian nonrelativistic without a
massive boson. The physical matter fields acquire exotic statistics . We
construct explicitly the algebra of the Poincare generators and show that it
differs from the Poincare one. We exhibit the role of the vacuum Berry phase in
the failure of the Poincare algebra to close. We prove that, in spite of the
background electric field, such phenomenon as the total screening of external
charges characteristic for the standard Schwinger model takes place in the
generalized chiral Schwinger model, too.
