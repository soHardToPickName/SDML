Finite W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  Finite versions of W-algebras are introduced by considering (symplectic)
reductions of finite dimensional simple Lie algebras. In particular a finite
analogue of $W^{(2)}_3$ is introduced and studied in detail. Its unitary and
non-unitary, reducible and irreducible highest weight representations are
constructed.
