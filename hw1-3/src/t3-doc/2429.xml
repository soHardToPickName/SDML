Broken quantum symmetry and confinement phases in planar physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Many two-dimensional physical systems have symmetries which are
mathematically described by quantum groups (quasi-triangular Hopf algebras). In
this letter we introduce the concept of a spontaneously broken Hopf symmetry
and show that it provides an effective tool for analysing a wide variety of
phases exhibiting many distinct confinement phenomena.
