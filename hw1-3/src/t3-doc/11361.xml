Electric-Magnetic Duality and WDVV Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the associativity (or WDVV) equations in the form they appear in
Seiberg-Witten theory and prove that they are covariant under generic
electric-magnetic duality transformations. We discuss the consequences of this
covariance from various perspectives.
