<title>
Wilson loop via AdS/CFT duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wilson loop in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory admits a dual
description as a macroscopic string configuration in the adS/CFT
correspondence. We discuss the correction to the quark anti-quark potential
arising from the fluctuations of the superstring.
