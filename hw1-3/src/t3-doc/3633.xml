<title>
A New Approach to Scalar Field Theory on Noncommutative Space
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach to constructing the noncommutative scalar field theory is
presented. Not only between x_i and p_j, we impose commutation relations
between x_is as well as p_js, and give a new representation of x_i,p_js. We
carry out both first- and second-quantization explicitly. The
second-quantization is performed in both the operator formalism and the
functional integral one.
