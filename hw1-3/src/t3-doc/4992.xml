<title>
On the thin-string limit of the 6d stringlike defect model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in 6d models localizing gravity on stringlike defects and
satisfying the dominant energy condition, the metric exterior to the string
inevitably depends on the string's thickness. As a consequence, in the limit of
thin string either the gravity delocalizes, or the six-dimensional Planck scale
must be much larger that the four-dimensional one.
