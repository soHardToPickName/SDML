1+1 Gauge Theories in the Light-Cone Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a representation independent solution to the continuum Schwinger
model in light-cone ($A^+ = 0$) gauge. We then discuss the problem of finding
that solution using various quantization schemes. In particular we shall
consider equal-time quantization and quantization on either characteristic
surface, $x^+ = 0$ or $x^- = 0$.
