On Action with Grassmann-Odd Lagrangian
</title>

<abstract>
  The action with the Grassmann-odd Lagrangian for the supersymmetric classical
Witten mechanics is constructed. It is shown that the exterior differential can
be used for the connection between Grassmann-even and Grassmann-odd
formulations of the classical dynamics in the superspace in both Hamilton's and
Lagrange's approaches.
