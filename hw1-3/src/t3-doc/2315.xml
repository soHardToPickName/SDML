Supersymmetry without hermiticity
</title>

<abstract>
  A new model of supersymmetry between bosons and fermions is proposed. Its
representation space is spanned by states with PT symmetry and real energies
but the inter-related partner Hamiltonians themselves remain complex and
non-Hermitian. The formalism admits vanishing Witten index.
