<title>
Matrices on a point as the theory of everything
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the world-line can be eliminated in the matrix quantum
mechanics conjectured by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind to describe the
light-cone physics of M theory. The resulting matrix model has a form that
suggests origins in the reduction to a point of a Yang-Mills theory. The
reduction of the Nishino-Sezgin 10+2 dimensional supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory to a point gives a matrix model with the appropriate features: Lorentz
invariance in 9+1 dimensions, supersymmetry, and the correct number of physical
degrees of freedom.
