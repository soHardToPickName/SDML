<title>
Two-dimensional SUSY-pseudo-Hermiticity without separation of variables
</title>

<abstract>
  We study SUSY-intertwining for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with special
emphasis to the two-dimensional generalized Morse potential, which does not
allow for separation of variables. The complexified methods of SUSY-separation
of variables and two-dimensional shape invariance are used to construct
particular solutions - both for complex conjugated energy pairs and for
non-paired complex energies.
