The Physics of Instantons in the pseudoscalar and vector meson mixing
</title>

<abstract>
  When the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics was introduced, it was to explain
the observed phenomena of quark confinement and scaling. It was then discovered
that the emergence of instantons is an essential consequence of this theory.
This led to unanticipated explanations not only for the anomalously high masses
of the $\eta$ and the $\eta'$ particles, but also for the remarkable
differences that had been observed in the mixing angles for the pseudoscalar
mesons and the vector mesons.
