Fermionic Coset Realization of Primaries in Critical Statistical Models
</title>

<abstract>
We obtain a fermionic coset realization of the primaries of minimal unitary
models and show how their four-point functions may be calculated by the use of
a reduction formula. We illustrate the construction for the Ising model, where
we obtain an explicit realization of the energy operator, Onsager fermions, as
well as of the order and disorder operators realizing the dual algebra, in
terms of constrained Dirac fermions. The four-point correlators of these
operators are shown to agree with those obtained by other methods.
