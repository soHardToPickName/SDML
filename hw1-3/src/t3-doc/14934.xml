Scalar-Scalar Bound State in Non-commutative Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Bethe-Salpeter equation in the non-commutative space for a scalar-scalar
bound state is considered. It is shown that in the non-relativistic limit, the
effect of spatial non-commutativity appears as if there exist a magnetic dipole
moment coupled to each particle.
