<title>
The no-ghost theorem in curved backgrounds with a timelike u(1): NSR
  string
</title>

<abstract>
  It is well-known that the standard no-ghost theorem is valid as long as the
background has the light-cone directions. We prove the no-ghost theorem for the
NSR string when only the timelike direction is flat. This is done by the BRST
quantization, using the technique of Frenkel, Garland and Zuckerman and our
previous results for the bosonic string. The theorem actually applies as long
as the timelike direction is written as a u(1) SCFT.
