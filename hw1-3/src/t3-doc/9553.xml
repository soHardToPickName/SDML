<title>
Determinant Formulae of Quasi-Finite Representation of W_{1+\infty}
  Algebra at Lower Levels
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the Kac determinant for the quasi-finite representation of \Winf
algebra up to level 8. It vanishes only when the central charge is integer. We
give an algebraic construction of null states and propose the character
formulae. The character of the Verma module is related to free fields in three
dimensions which has rather exotic modular properties.
