<title>
Superpropagators for explicitly broken 3D-supersymmetric theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A systematic algorithm to derive superpropagators in the case of either
explicitly or spontaneously broken supersymmetric three-dimensional theories is
presented. We discuss how the explicit breaking terms that are introduced at
tree-level induce 1-loop radiative corrections to the effective action. We also
point out that the renormalisation effects and the breaking-inducing-breaking
mechanism become more immediate whenever we adopt the shifted superpropagators
discussed in this letter.
