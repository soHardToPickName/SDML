<title>
On the symplectic structures arising in Optics
</title>

<abstract>
  Geometric optics is analysed using the techniques of Presymplectic Geometry.
We obtain the symplectic structure of the space of light rays in a medium of a
non constant refractive index by reduction from a presymplectic structure, and
using adapted coordinates, we find Darboux coordinates. The theory is
illustrated with some examples and we point out some simple physical
applications
