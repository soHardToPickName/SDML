<title>
The Holographic Principle
</title>

<abstract>
  After a pedagogical overview of the present status of High-Energy Physics,
some problems concerning physics at the Planck scale are formulated, and an
introduction is given to a notion that became known as ``the holographic
principle" in Planck scale physics, which is arrived at by studying quantum
mechanical features of black holes.
