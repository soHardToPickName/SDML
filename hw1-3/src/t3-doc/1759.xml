<title>
Solitons in topological field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a topological Lagrangian field theory that is geometrically
similar to the Yang-Mills(-Higgs) Lagrangian, and study the Bogomol'nyi
solitons contained within this theory. The topological field theory may provide
an example of a dual field theory to Yang-Mills(-Higgs). The existence of a
dual field theory to Yang-Mills(-Higgs) was conjectured by Montonen and Olive.
