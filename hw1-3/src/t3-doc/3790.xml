<title>
Local BRST cohomology of the gauged principal non-linear sigma model
</title>

<abstract>
  The local BRST cohomology of the gauged non-linear sigma model on a group
manifold is worked out for any Lie group G. We consider both, the case where
the gauge field is dynamical and the case where it has no kinetic term (G/G
topological theory). Our results shed a novel light on the problem of gauging
the WZW term as well as on the nature of the topological terms introduced a few
years ago by De Wit, Hull and Rocek. We also consider the BRST cohomology of
the rigid symmetries of the ungauged model and recover the results of D'Hoker
and Weinberg on the most general effective actions compatible with the
symmetries.
