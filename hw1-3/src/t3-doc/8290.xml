Super-Calogero-Moser-Sutherland systems and free super-oscillators : a
  mapping
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the supersymmetric rational Calogero-Moser-Sutherland (CMS)
model of A_{N+1}-type is equivalent to a set of free super-oscillators, through
a similarity transformation. We prescribe methods to construct the complete
eigen-spectrum and the associated eigen-functions, both in supersymmetry
preserving as well as supersymmetry breaking phases, from the free
super-oscillator basis. Further we show that a wide class of super-Hamiltonians
realizing dynamical OSp(2|2) supersymmetry, which also includes all types of
rational super-CMS as a small subset, are equivalent to free super-oscillators.
We study BC_{N+1}-type super-CMS model in some detail to understand the
subtleties involved in this method.
