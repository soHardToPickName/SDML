Anomaly cancellation in M-theory on orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present calculation of the anomaly cancellation in M-theory on orbifolds
$S^1/Z_2$ and $T^5/Z_2$ in the upstairs approach. The main requirement that
allows one to uniquely define solutions to the modified Bianchi identities in
this case is that the field strength $G$ be globally defined on $S^1$ or $T^5$
and properly transforming under $Z_2$. We solve for general $G$ that satisfies
these requirements and explicitly construct anomaly-free theories in the
upstairs approach. We also obtain the solutions in the presence of five-branes.
All these constructions show equivalence of the downstairs and upstairs
approaches. For example in the $S^1/Z_2$ case the ten-dimensional gauge
coupling and the anomaly cancellation at each wall are the same as in the
downstairs approach.
