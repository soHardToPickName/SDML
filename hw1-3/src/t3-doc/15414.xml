Supersymmetry at Large Distance Scales
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that the UV/IR relation that underlies the AdS/CFT duality may
provide a natural mechanism by which high energy supersymmetry can have large
distance consequences. We motivate this idea via (a string realization of) the
Randall-Sundrum scenario, in which the observable matter is localized on a
matter brane separate from the Planck brane. As suggested via the holographic
interpretation of this scenario, we argue that the local dynamics of the Planck
brane - which determines the large scale 4-d geometry - is protected by the
high energy supersymmetry of the dual 4-d theory. With this assumption, we show
that the total vacuum energy naturally cancels in the effective 4-d Einstein
equation. This cancellation is robust against changes in the low energy
dynamics on the matter brane, which gets stabilized via the holographic RG
without any additional fine-tuning.
