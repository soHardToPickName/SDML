<title>
Higher Derivatives and Canonical Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  A canonical formalism for higher-derivative theories is presented on the
basis of Dirac's method for constrained systems. It is shown that this
formalism shares a path integral expression with Ostrogradski's canonical
formalism.
