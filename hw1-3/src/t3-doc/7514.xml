<title>
Finite W Algebras and Intermediate Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  New realizations of finite W algebras are constructed by relaxing the usual
constraint conditions. Then, finite W algebras are recognized in the Heisenberg
quantization recently proposed by Leinaas and Myrheim, for a system of two
identical particles in d dimensions. As the anyonic parameter is directly
associated to the W-algebra involved in the d=1 case, it is natural to consider
that the W-algebra framework is well-adapted for a possible generalization of
the anyon statistics.
