Many-body Dynamics of D0--Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the growth of the size with the number of partons holds in a
Thomas-Fermi analysis of the threshold bound state of D0--branes. Our results
sharpen the evidence that for a fixed value of the eleven dimensional radius
the partonic velocities can be made arbitrarily small as one approaches the
large N limit.
