Quantum Field Theory and Unification in AdS5
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider gauge bosons in the bulk of AdS5 in a two-brane theory that
addresses the hierarchy problem. We show such a theory can be consistent with
gauge coupling unification at a high scale. We discuss subtleties in this
calculation and show how to regulate consistently in a bounded AdS5 background.
Our regularization is guided by the holographic dual of the calculation.
