<title>
A superspace approach to branes and supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent developments in string and M theory rely heavily on supersymmetry
suggesting that a revival of superspace techniques in ten and eleven dimensions
may be advantageous. Here we discuss three topics of current interest where
superspace is already playing an important role and where an improved
understanding of superspace might provide additional insight into the issues
involved.
