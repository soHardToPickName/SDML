<title>
An action for supergravity interacting with super-p-brane sources
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the coupled system of supergravity and a superbrane source by the
sum of the group manifold action for D--dimensional supergravity and the action
for a super--$p$--brane. We derive the generalized Einstein equation with the
source and discuss the local fermionic symmetries of the coupled action. Our
scheme could be especially relevant in $D=11, 10$, in which the superfield
actions for supergravity are not known.
