Quantum Fields in anti-de Sitter space and the Maldacena conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  We review in this lecture the relation between the Maldacena Conjecture, also
known as AdS/CFT correspondence, and the so called Holographic principle that
seems to be an essential ingredient for a quantum gravity theory. We also
illustrate the idea of Holography by showing that the curvature of the anti-de
Sitter space reduces the number of degrees of freedom making it possible to
find a mapping between a quantum theory defined on the bulk and another defined
on the corresponding boundary.
