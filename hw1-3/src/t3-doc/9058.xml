<title>
Static Quantization of Two-dimensional Dilaton Gravity and Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Two-dimensional matterless dilaton gravity is a topological theory and can be
classically reduced to a (0+1)-dimensional theory with a finite number of
degrees of freedom. If quantization is performed, a simple gauge invariant
quantum mechanics is obtained. The properties of the gauge invariant operators
and of the Hilbert space of physical states can be determined. In particular,
for N-dimensional pure gravity with (N-2)-dimensional spherical symmetry, the
square of the ADM mass operator is self-adjoint, not the mass itself.
