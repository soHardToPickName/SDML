Second Order Formalism for fermions: Anomalies and Species doubling on
  the Laticce
</title>

<abstract>
  A new formulation for fermions on the lattice based on a discretization of a
second order formalism is proposed. A comparison with the first order formalism
in connection with the $U(1)$ anomaly and the doubling problem is presented.
The new formulation allows to eliminate half of the degrees of freedom, which
can be important in non-perturbative calculations, and it can new possibities
to the formulation of chiral gauge theories.
