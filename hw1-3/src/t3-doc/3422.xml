Noncommutative Monopole at the Second Order in \theta
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the noncommutative U(2) monopole solution at the second order in the
noncommutativity parameter \theta^{ij}. We solve the BPS equation in
noncommutative super Yang-Mills theory to O(\theta^2), transform the solution
to the commutative description by the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map, and evaluate the
eigenvalues of the scalar field. We find that, by tuning the free parameters in
the SW map, we can make the scalar eigenvalues precisely reproduce the
configuration of a tilted D-string suspended between two parallel D3-branes.
This gives an example of how the ambiguities inevitable in the higher order SW
map are fixed by physical requirements.
