<title>
Warped Compactification with an Abelian Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate warped compactification with an abelian gauge theory in six
dimensions. The vanishing cosmological constant in four dimensions can
generically be realized with a regular metric even in a 3-brane background
without fine tuning of couplings.
