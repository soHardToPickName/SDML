Massless QCD_2 From Current Constituents
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the spectra of multi-flavor massless QCD_2. An approximation in
which the Hilbert space is truncated to two currents states is used. We write
down a 't Hooft like equation for the wave function of the two currents states.
We solve this equation for the lowest massive state and find an excellent
agreement with the DLCQ results. In addition, the 't Hooft model and the large
N_f limit spectra are re-derived by using a description in terms of currents.
