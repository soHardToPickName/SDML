<title>
On the Quantum Cohomology Rings of General Type Projective Hypersurfaces
  and Generalized Mirror Transformation
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we study the structure of the quantum cohomology ring of a
projective hypersurface with non-positive 1st Chern class. We prove a theorem
which suggests that the mirror transformation of the quantum cohomology of a
projective Calabi-Yau hypersurface has a close relation with the ring of
symmetric functions, or with Schur polynomials. With this result in mind, we
propose a generalized mirror transformation on the quantum cohomology of a
hypersurface with negative first Chern class and construct an explicit
prediction formula for three point Gromov-Witten invariants up to cubic
rational curves. We also construct a projective space resolution of the moduli
space of polynomial maps, which is in a good correspondence with the terms that
appear in the generalized mirror transformation.
