Eichler integrals and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article, it is shown how to obtain objects called Eichler integrals
in the mathematical literature that can be used for calculating scattering
amplitudes in String Theory. These Eichler integrals are also new examples of
Eichler integrals with poles.
