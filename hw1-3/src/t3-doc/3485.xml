The General Coset Orbifold Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently an action formulation, called the general WZW orbifold action, was
given for each sector of every WZW orbifold. In this paper we gauge this action
by general twisted gauge groups to find the action formulation of each sector
of every coset orbifold. Connection with the known current-algebraic
formulation of coset orbifolds is discussed as needed, and some large examples
are worked out in further detail.
