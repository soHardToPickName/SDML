Nonlinear Constraints from Non-Abelian Internal Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  Symmetry invariant local interaction of a many body system leads to global
constraints. We obtain explicit forms of the global macroscopic condition
assuring that at the microscopic level the evolution respects the overall
symmetry.
