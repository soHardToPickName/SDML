<title>
Asymptotic symmetry and conservation laws in 2d Poincar\'e gauge theory
  of gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The structure of the asymptotic symmetry in the Poincar\'e gauge theory of
gravity in 2d is clarified by using the Hamiltonian formalism. The improved
form of the generator of the asymptotic symmetry is found for very general
asymptotic behaviour of phase space variables, and the related conserved
quantities are explicitly constructed.
