Quantizing the (0,4) Supersymmetric ADHM Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the quantization of the ADHM sigma model. We show that the only
quantum contributions to the effective theory come from the chiral anomalies
and compute the first and second order terms. Finally the limit of vanishing
instanton size is discussed.
