R-matrices for highest weight representations of sl_q(2,C) at roots of
  unity
</title>

<abstract>
  The general formula for R-matrices of slq(2,C) for the highest weight repre-
sentations both for general q and for q being a root of unity by generalizing
G.Gomez's and G.Sierra's one for semiperiodic representations of slq(2,C) at
roots of unity is presented.
