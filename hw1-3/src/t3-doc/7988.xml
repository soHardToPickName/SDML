D=11, p=5
</title>

<abstract>
  The equations of motion of the super five-brane in D=11 dimensions are
derived using the formalism of superembeddings. The equations describe highly
nonlinear self-interactions of a tensor multiplet in the six dimensional
worlsurface, and they have manifest worldsurface local supersymmetry. The
geometry of the target space corresponds to D=11 supergravity.
