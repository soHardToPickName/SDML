Grand Unification in Non-Associative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate the flipped SU(5) x U(1)-GUT within the framework of
non-associative geometry. It suffices to take the matrix Lie algebra su(5) as
the input; the u(1)-part with its representation on the fermions is an
algebraic consequence. The occurring Higgs multiplets
(24,5,45,50-representations of su(5)) are uniquely determined by the fermionic
mass matrix and the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern to SU(3) x U(1). We
find the most general gauge invariant Higgs potential that is compatible with
the given Higgs vacuum. Our formalism yields tree-level predictions for the
masses of all gauge and Higgs bosons. It turns out that the low-energy sector
is identical with the standard model. In particular, there exists precisely one
light Higgs field, whose upper bound for the mass is 1.45 m_t. All remaining
207 Higgs fields are extremely heavy.
