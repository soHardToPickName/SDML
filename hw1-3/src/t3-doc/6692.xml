<title>
Probing partially localized supergravity background of fundamental
  string ending on Dp-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the dynamics of the probe fundamental string in the field background
of the partially localized supergravity solution for the fundamental string
ending on Dp-brane. We separately analyze the probe dynamics for its motion
along the worldvolume direction and the transverse direction of the source
Dp-brane. We compare the dynamics of the probe along the Dp-brane worldvolume
direction to the BIon dynamics.
