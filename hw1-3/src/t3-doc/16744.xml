Mesons, Baryons and Waves in the Baby Skyrmion Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study various classical solutions of the baby-Skyrmion model in $(2+1)$
dimensions. We point out the existence of higher energy states interpret them
as resonances of Skyrmions and anti-Skyrmions and study their decays. Most of
the discussion involves a highly exited Skyrmion-like state with winding number
one which decays into an ordinary Skyrmion and a Skyrmion-anti-Skyrmion pair.
We also study wave-like solutions of the model and show that some of such
solutions can be constructed from the solutions of the sine-Gordon equation. We
also show that the baby-Skyrmion has non-topological stationary solutions. We
study their interactions with Skyrmions.
