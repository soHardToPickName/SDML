Descent Relations in Type 0A/0B
</title>

<abstract>
  The type 0 theories have twice as many stable D-branes as the type II
theories. In light of this added complication, we find the descent relations
for D-branes in the type 0A and 0B theories. In addition, we work out how the
two types of D-branes differ in their couplings to NS-NS fields.
