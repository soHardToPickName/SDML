Nonassociative Star Product Deformations for D-brane Worldvolumes in
  Curved Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the deformation of D-brane world-volumes in curved
backgrounds. We calculate the leading corrections to the boundary conformal
field theory involving the background fields, and in particular we study the
correlation functions of the resulting system. This allows us to obtain the
world-volume deformation, identifying the open string metric and the
noncommutative deformation parameter. The picture that unfolds is the
following: when the gauge invariant combination \omega = B + F is constant one
obtains the standard Moyal deformation of the brane world-volume. Similarly,
when d\omega = 0 one obtains the noncommutative Kontsevich deformation,
physically corresponding to a curved brane in a flat background. When the
background is curved, H = d\omega \not= 0, we find that the relevant algebraic
structure is still based on the Kontsevich expansion, which now defines a
nonassociative star product with an A_\infty homotopy associative algebraic
structure. We then recover, within this formalism, some known results of Matrix
theory in curved backgrounds. In particular, we show how the effective action
obtained in this framework describes, as expected, the dielectric effect of
D-branes. The polarized branes are interpreted as a soliton, associated to the
condensation of the brane gauge field.
