<title>
Teleportation of Quantum States
</title>

<abstract>
  Bennett et al. (PRL 70, 1859 (1993)) have shown how to transfer ("teleport")
an unknown spin quantum state by using prearranged correlated quantum systems
and transmission of classical information. I will show how their results can be
obtained in the framework of nonlocal measurements proposed by Aharonov and
Albert I will generalize the latter to the teleportation of a quantum state of
a system with continuous variables.
