<title>
Tau-Functions and Generalized Integrable Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  The tau-function formalism for a class of generalized ``zero-curvature''
integrable hierarchies of partial differential equations, is constructed. The
class includes the Drinfel'd-Sokolov hierarchies. A direct relation between the
variables of the zero-curvature formalism and the tau-functions is established.
The formalism also clarifies the connection between the zero-curvature
hierarchies and the Hirota-type hierarchies of Kac and Wakimoto.
