<title>
Positronium as an example of algebraic composite calculations
</title>

<abstract>
  The functional quantum field theory, developed by Stumpf, provides the
possibility to derive the quantum dynamics of a positronium gas from Coulomb
interacting electrons and positrons. By this example, the method will be
brought in a Clifford algebraic light, through identifying the functional space
with an infinite dimensional Euclidean Clifford algebra.
