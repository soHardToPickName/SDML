<title>
The finiteness of the four dimensional antisymmetric tensor field model
  in a curved background
</title>

<abstract>
  A renormalizable rigid supersymmetry for the four dimensional antisymmetric
tensor field model in a curved space-time background is constructed. A closed
algebra between the BRS and the supersymmetry operators is only realizable if
the vector parameter of the supersymmetry is a covariantly constant vector
field. This also guarantees that the corresponding transformations lead to a
genuine symmetry of the model. The proof of the ultraviolet finiteness to all
orders of perturbation theory is performed in a pure algebraic manner by using
the rigid supersymmetry.
