<title>
The Continuum Limit of the Schwinger-Dyson Equations of the One and Two
  Matrix Model with Finite Loop Length
</title>

<abstract>
  We take the continuum limit of the \sdeq s of the one and two matrix model
without expanding them in the length of the loop. The resulting equations agree
with those proposed for string field theory in the temporal gauge. We find that
the loop operators are required to mix in the two matrix model case and
determine the non-constant tadpole terms.
