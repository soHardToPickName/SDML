Solving String Field Equations: New Uses for Old Tools
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the (NS-sector) superstring field equations are integrable,
i. e. their solutions are obtainable from linear equations. We adapt the
25-year-old solution-generating "dressing" method and reduce the construction
of nonperturbative superstring configurations to a specific cohomology problem.
The application to vacuum superstring field theory is outlined.
