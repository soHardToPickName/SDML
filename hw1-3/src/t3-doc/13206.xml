Mirror Transform and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Some aspects of Mirror symmetry are reviewed, with an emphasis on more recent
results extending mirror transform to higher genus Riemann surfaces and its
relation to the Kodaira-Spencer theory of gravity (talk given in the Geometry
and Topology Conference, April 93, Harvard, in honor of Raoul Bott)
