The Off-Shell Massive Hypermultiplets Revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  On the base of the notion of N=2 abelian Yang-Mills supergeometry with
constant curvature, we propose an off-shell formulation for the massive
q-hypermultiplet and complex $\omega$-hypermultiplet in the standard harmonic
superspase without central charge variables. The corresponding superpropagators
are derived.
