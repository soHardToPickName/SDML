<title>
Two-Dimensional Higher-Derivative Supergravity and a New Mechanism for
  Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the general form of quadratic (1,1) supergravity in two
dimensions, and show that this theory is equivalent to two scalar
supermultiplets coupled to non-trivial supergravity. It is demonstrated that
the theory possesses stable vacua with vanishing cosmological constant which
spontaneously break supersymmetry.
