<title>
The Effective Lagrangian of QED with a Magnetic Charge
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective Lagrangian of QED coupled to dyons is calculated. The resulting
generalization of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian contains non-linear $P$- and
$T$-nonivariant (but $C$ invariant) terms corresponding to the virtual pair
creation of dyons. As examples, the amplitudes for photon splitting and photon
coalescence are calculated.
