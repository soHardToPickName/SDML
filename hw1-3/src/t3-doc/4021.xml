Path Intergals and Perturbative Expansions for Non-Compact Symmetric
  Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to construct path integrals for quantum mechanical systems where
the space of configurations is a general non-compact symmetric space.
Associated with this path integral is a perturbation theory which respects the
global structure of the system. This perturbation expansion is evaluated for a
simple example and leads to a new exactly soluble model. This work is a step
towards the construction of a strong coupling perturbation theory for quantum
gravity.
