<title>
Antiferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg Chain and the Two-flavor Massless
  Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  An antiferromagnetic S=1/2 Heisenberg chain is mapped to the two-flavor
massless Schwinger model at \theta=\pi. The electromagnetic coupling constant
and velocity of light in the Schwinger model are determined in terms of the
Heisenberg coupling and lattice spacing in the spin chain system.
