Quantum Gravity in D=5 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a topological Chern-Simons term in D=5 dimensions coupled to
Einstein Hilbert theory. Hartree approximation for topological Lagrangian and
the Chern-Simons term in D=3 is considered. An effective model of Quantum
Gravity in D=5 dimensions is presented here. The analysis of residues is
considered and the unitarity is guaranteed at tree level. The propagator is
ghost and tachyon free.
