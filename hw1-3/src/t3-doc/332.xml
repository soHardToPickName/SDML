Topics in M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a brief history of the passage from strings to branes and we review
some aspects of the following topics in M-theory: (a) an extended brane scan,
(b) superembedding approach to the dynamics of superbranes and (c)
supermembranes in anti de Sitter space, singletons and massless higher spin
field theories.
