Logarithmic Corrections to Black Hole Entropy and AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula for
five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes due to thermodynamic
fluctuations. The result is then compared with the boundary gauge theory
entropy corrections via AdS/CFT correspondence. We then further generalise our
analysis for the rotating black hole in five dimensional AdS space.
