N=2 Supermultiplet of Currents and Anomalous Transformations in
  Supersymmetric Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine some properties of supermultiplet consisting of the U(1)_{J}
current, extended supercurrents, energy-momentum tensor and the central charge
in N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The superconformal improvement
requires adding another supermultiplet beginning with the U(1)_{R} current. We
determine the anomalous (quantum mechanical) supersymmetry transformation
associated with the central charge and the energy-momentum tensor to one-loop
order.
