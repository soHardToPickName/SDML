Superspace Geometrical Realization of the N-Extended Super Virasoro
  Algebra and its Dual
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive properties of N-extended GR super Virasoro algebras. These include
adding central extensions, identification of all primary fields and the action
of the adjoint representation on its dual. The final result suggest
identification with the spectrum of fields in supergravity theories and
superstring/M-theory constructed from NSR N-extended supersymmetric ${\cal
{GR}}$ Virasoro algebras.
