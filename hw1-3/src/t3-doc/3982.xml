<title>
Dark Matter, Quantum Gravity, Vacuum Energy, and Lorentz Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the problems of dark matter, quantum gravity, and vacuum energy
within the context of a theory for which Lorentz invariance is not postulated,
but instead emerges as a natural consequence in the physical regimes where it
has been tested.
