Nambu-Goto string action with Gauss-Bonnet term
</title>

<abstract>
We examine the relativistic Nambu-Goto model with Gauss-Bonnet boundary term
added to the action integral. The system is analysed using an invariant
representation of dynamical string degrees of freedom by complex Liouville
fields. The solutions of classical equations of motion for open strings are
described.
