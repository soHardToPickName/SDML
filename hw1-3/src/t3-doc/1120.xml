<title>
Parent Action Approach for the Duality between Non-Abelian Self-Dual and
  Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons Models
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been argued by some authors that the parent action approach cannot be
used in order to establish the duality between the 2+1 Abelian and non-Abelian
Self-Dual (SD) and Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons (YMCS) models for all the coupling
regimes. We propose here an alternative (perturbative) point of view, and show
that this equivalence can be achieved with the parent action approach.
