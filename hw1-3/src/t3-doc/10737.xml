Interaction of Branes at Angles in M(atrix) Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Interactions of relatively rotated Dp-branes in 1, 2, 3 and 4 angles in
M(atrix) model are calculated and it is found to be in agreement with string
theory calculations. In 4 angles case the agreement is achieved after
subtracting the contribution of the single chiral fermionic zero mode.
