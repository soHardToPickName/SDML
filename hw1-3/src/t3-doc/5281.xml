<title>
Dual Supersymmetry Algebras from Partial Supersymmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  The partial breaking of supersymmetry in flat space can be accomplished using
any one of three dual representations for the massive N=1 spin-3/2 multiplet.
Each of the representations can be ``unHiggsed'', which gives rise to a set of
dual N=2 supergravities and supersymmetry algebras.
