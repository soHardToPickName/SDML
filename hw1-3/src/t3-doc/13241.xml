<title>
The Role of the Central Element in the Quantum Algebra Underlying the
  Twisted XXZ Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relationship among the XXZ Heisenberg model and three models
obtained from it by various transformations. In particular, we emphasize the
role of a non trivial central element $t^Z$ in the underlying algebra and its
relationship with the twisted boundary conditions,
$S^{\pm}_{N+1}=t^{\pm N}S^{\pm}_1$.
