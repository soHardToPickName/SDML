<title>
One loop renormalization of the 4-D Quantum Dilaton Gravity in Spherical
  symmetric background
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the one loop renormalization in the most general metric-dilaton
theory with second derivative only. In constant background dilaton theory,
there are two types of gravity background which enable the theory
renormalizable at one-loop level. We show this concretely to discuss on the
spherical symmetric background.
