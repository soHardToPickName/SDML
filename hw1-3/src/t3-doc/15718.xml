<title>
8D oscillator as a hidden SU(2) - monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  In this report, in the framework of an analytical approach and with help of
the generalized version of the Hurwitz transformation the five-dimensional
SU(2)--monopole model is constructed from the eight-dimensional quantum
oscillator. The SU(2)--monopole fields, the Clebsh-Gordan expansion stimulated
by the space-gauge coupling, the hyperangle and the radial parts of the total
wave function, the energy spectrum of the charge-monopole bound system and the
corresponding degeneracy are calculated.
