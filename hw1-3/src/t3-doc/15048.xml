<title>
Hidden Symmetries of the Principal Chiral Model and a Nonstandard Loop
  Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the precise structure of the loop algebra of `dressing' symmetries
of the Principal Chiral Model, and discuss a new infinite set of abelian
symmetries of the field equations which preserve a symplectic form on the space
of solutions.
