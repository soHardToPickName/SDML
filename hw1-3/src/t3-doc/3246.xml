<title>
Nonabelian Fields in Exact String Solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  Within the framework of "anomalously gauged" Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models,
we construct solutions which include nonabelian fields. Both compact and
noncompact groups are discussed. In the case of compact groups, as an example
of background containing nonabelian fields, we discuss conformal theory on the
$SO(4)/SO(3)$ coset, which is the natural generalization of the 2D monopole
theory corresponding to the $SO(3)/SO(2)$ coset. In noncompact case, we
consider examples with $SO(2,1)/SO(1,1)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3,1)$ cosets.
