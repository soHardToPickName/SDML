<title>
Gaugino condensation with a linear multiplet
</title>

<abstract>
  An effective lagrangian analysis of gaugino condensation is performed in a
supersymmetric gauge theory with field-dependent gauge couplings described with
a linear multiplet. An original aspect of this effective lagrangian is the use
of a real vector superfield to describe composite gauge invariant degrees of
freedom. The duality equivalence of this approach with the more familiar
formulation using a chiral superfield is demonstrated. These results strongly
suggest that chiral-linear duality survives nonperturbative effects in
superstrings.
