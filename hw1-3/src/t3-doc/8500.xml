<title>
The trigonometric counterpart of the Haldane Shastry Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The hierarchy of Integrable Spin Chain Hamiltonians, which are trigonometric
analogs of the Haldane Shastry Model and of the associated higher conserved
charges, is derived by a reduction from the trigonometric Dynamical Models of
Bernard-Gaudin-Haldane-Pasquier. The Spin Chain Hamiltonians have the property
of $U_q(\hat{gl}_2)$-invariance. The spectrum of the Hamiltonians and the
$U_q(\hat{gl}_2)$-representation content of their eigenspaces are found by a
descent from the Dynamical Models.
