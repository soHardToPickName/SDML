<title>
Periods and Prepotential of N=2 Supersymmetric E_6 Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the periods and one-instanton coefficient of the N=2
superrsymmetric Yang-Mills theory with the exceptional gauge group E_6. These
calculations are based on the E_6 spectral curve and the obtained
one-instanton coefficient is in agreement with the microscopic results.
