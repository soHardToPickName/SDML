Anomaly in conformal quantum mechanics: From molecular physics to black
  holes
</title>

<abstract>
  A number of physical systems exhibit asymptotic conformal invariance. Within
a particular range of distances, they are characterized by an inverse square
potential, the absence of dimensional scales, and an SO(2,1) symmetry algebra.
Examples ranging from molecular physics to black holes are provided. For such
systems, quantum symmetry breaking -- revealed by the failure of the symmetry
generators to close the algebra -- is shown to be independent of the
renormalization procedure.
