<title>
Integrable Systems and W-Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  The basic concepts underlying our analysis of {\it W-algebras} as extended
symmetries of integrable systems are summarized. The construction starts from
the second hamiltonian structure of ``Generalized Drinfel'd-Sokolov''
hierarchies, and its correspondence with the $A_1$-embeddings is established,
providing a rather simple and general scheme.
