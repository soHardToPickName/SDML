Generalized Topological Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we will examine a "generalized topological sigma model." This
so-called "generalized topological sigma model" is the M-Theoretic analog of
the standard topological sigma model of string theory. We find that the
observables of the theory are elements in the cohomology ring of the moduli
space of supersymmetric maps; in addition, we find that the correlation
functions of such observables allow us to compute non-perturbative corrections
to the four-fermion terms present in M-Theory on a six-dimensional Calabi-Yau.
