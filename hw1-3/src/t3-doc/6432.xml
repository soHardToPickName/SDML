Dualities of the Matrix Model from T-Duality of the Type II String
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate in the Matrix theory framework, the subgroup of dualities of
the DLCQ of M-theory compactified on three-tori, which corresponds to T-duality
in the auxiliary Type II string theory. We show how these dualities are
realized in the supersymmetric Yang-Mills gauge theories on dual noncommutative
three-tori.
