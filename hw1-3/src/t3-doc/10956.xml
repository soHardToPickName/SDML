<title>
Quantization Ambiguity and Supersymmetric Ground State Wave Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric ground state wave functions of a model of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics on $S^1$ (supersymmetric simple pendulum) are studied.
Supersymmetry can be broken due to the existence of an undetermined parameter,
which is interpreted as a gauge field and appears as a firm consequence of
quantization on a space with a nontrivial topology such as $S^1$. The breaking
does not depend on the leading term of the superpotential, contrary to the
usual case. The mechanism of supersymmetry breaking is similar to that through
boundary conditions of fields in supersymmetric quantum field theory on
compactified space. The supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is realized in the
limit of the infinite radius of $S^1$ with the strength of the oscillator being
constant.
