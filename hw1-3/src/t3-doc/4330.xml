<title>
Solitons in a Grassmannian sigma-model Coupled to Chern-Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an exactly solvable Grassmannian sigma-model coupled to the
Chern-Simons theory. In the presence of a novel topological term our model
admits exact self-dual vortex solutions which are identical to those of pure
Grassmannian model, but the topological charge has a physical meaning as a
magnetic flux since the gauge field is no longer auxiliary. We also extend the
theory to a noncommutative plane and analyze the BPS solutions.
