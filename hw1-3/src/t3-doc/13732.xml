Comments on D-branes on general group manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate D-branes with maximal symmetry on general group manifolds in
terms of boundary states and effective actions. We show that in large $k$ limit
boundary states with an suitable Wilson line form boundary states of the other
types of D-branes, extending the known fact in SU(2) case. We also show that
fluctuation mass spectrum around D-brane solutions of the effective action
agrees with that of boundary CFT in large $k$ limit.
