Background Fields in 2+1 Topological Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The partition function of 2+1 Chern-Simons Witten topological gravity has an
attractive interpretation in terms of the unbroken and broken phases of
gravity. We make this physical interpretation manifest using the background
field method.
