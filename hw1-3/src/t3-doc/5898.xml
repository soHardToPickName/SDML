<title>
The Dirac Operator in a Fermion Bag Background in 1+1 Dimensions and
  Generalized Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the spectral theory of the Dirac operator $D = i\delsl-\sigma(x)
-i\pi(x)\gam_5$ in a static background $(\sigma(x),\pi(x))$ in 1+1 space-time
dimensions, is underlined by a certain generalization of supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, and explore its consequences.
