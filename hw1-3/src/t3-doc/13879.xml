<title>
Correlation functions for some conformal theories on Riemann surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the geometrical connection between 2D conformal field theories,
random walks on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces and knot theory. For the wide class
of CFTs with monodromies being the discrete subgroups of SL(2,R), the
determination of four-point correlation functions are related to construction
of topological invariants for random walks on multipunctured Riemann surfaces
