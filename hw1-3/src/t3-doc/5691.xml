Dynkin diagram strategy for orbifolding with Wilson lines
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple method for breaking gauge groups by orbifolding is presented. We
extend the method of Kac and Peterson to include Wilson lines. The complete
classification of the gauge group breaking, e.g. from heterotic string, is now
possible. From this Dynkin diagram technique, one can easily visualize the
origin and the symmetry pattern of the surviving gauge group.
