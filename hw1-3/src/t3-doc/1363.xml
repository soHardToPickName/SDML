<title>
Field Theory, Critical Phenomena and Interfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  These lecture notes want to illustrate the close connection between
statistical mechanics and field theory not only on the formal level, i.e. that
many concepts of one area can easily be taken over to the other one, but also
on the level of actual calculations. To this purpose, the last section will
demonstrate that a special statistical system, the binary fluid system, can be
described by field theory in its critical behaviour.
