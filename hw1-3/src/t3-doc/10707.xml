Two Phases for Compact U(1) Pure Gauge Theory in Three Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that if actions more general than the usual simple plaquette action
($\sim F_{\mu\nu}^2$) are considered, then compact $U(1)$ {\sl pure} gauge
theory in three Euclidean dimensions can have two phases. Both phases are
confining phases, however in one phase the monopole condensate spontaneously
`magnetizes'. For a certain range of parameters the phase transition is
continuous, allowing the definition of a strong coupling continuum limit. We
note that these observations have relevance to the `fictitious' gauge field
theories of strongly correlated electron systems, such as those describing
high-$T_c$ superconductors.
