<title>
Bose-Einstein condensation may occur in a constant magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  Bose-Einstein condensation of charged scalar and vector particles may
actually occur in presence of a constant homogeneous magnetic field, but there
is no critical temperature at which condensation starts. The condensate is
described by the statistical distribution. The Meissner effect is possible in
the scalar, but not in the vector field case, which exhibits a ferromagnetic
behavior.
