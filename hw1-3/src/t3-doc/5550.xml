Superembedding Approach and S-Duality. A unified description of
  superstring and super-D1-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  It is proved that a basic superembedding equation for the 2-dimensional
worldsheet superspace $\S^{(2|8+8)}$ embedded into D=10 type IIB superspace
$M^{(10|16+16)}$ provides a universal, S-duality invariant description of a
fundamental superstring and super-D1-brane. We work out generalized action
principle, obtain superfield equations of motion for both these objects and
find how the S-duality transformations relate the superfield equations of
superstring and super-D1-brane.
  The superembedding of 6-dimensional worldsheet superspace $\S^{(6|16)}$ into
the D=10 type IIB superspace will probably provide a similar universal
description for the set of type IIB super-NS5-brane, super-D5-brane and a
Kaluza-Klein monopole (super-KK5-brane).
