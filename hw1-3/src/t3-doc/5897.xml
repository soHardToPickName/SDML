<title>
Brackets in the jet-bundle approach to field theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first part the sh Lie structure of brackets in field theory, described
in the jet bundle context along the lines suggested by Gel'fand, Dickey and
Dorfman, is analyzed. In the second part, we discuss how this description
allows us to find a natural relation between the Batalin-Vilkovisky antibracket
and the Poisson bracket.
