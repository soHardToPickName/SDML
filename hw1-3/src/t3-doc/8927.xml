<title>
Quaternionic Extension of the Double Taub-NUT Metric
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the generic harmonic superspace action of the
quaternion-K\"ahler sigma models and using the quotient approach we present, in
an explicit form, a quaternion-K\"ahler extension of the double Taub-NUT
metric. It possesses $U(1)\times U(1)$ isometry and supplies a new example of
non-homogeneous Einstein metric with self-dual Weyl tensor.
