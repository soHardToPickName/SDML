<title>
Do Black Holes Destroy Information?
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the information loss paradox that was first formulated by Hawking,
and discuss possible ways of resolving it. All proposed solutions have serious
drawbacks. I conclude that the information loss paradox may well presage a
revolution in fundamental physics. (To appear in the proceedings of the
International Symposium on Black Holes,
  Membranes, Wormholes, and Superstrings.)
