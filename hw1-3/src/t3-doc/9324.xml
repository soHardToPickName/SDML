<title>
Warped Compactification with a Four-Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  Warped compactification of the six-dimensional bulk with a negative
cosmological constant is realized with a 4-brane along with an abelian gauge
theory. No fine tuning of couplings are needed to obtain the vanishing
cosmological constant in four dimensions, as is the case for the bulk with a
positive cosmological constant.
