<title>
On scheme dependence of gravitational dressing of renormalization group
  functions
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that for 2D field theories only the first order coefficient of
the gravitationally dressed RG $\beta$-function is scheme independent. This is
valid even for matter theories with one dimensionless coupling, where the first
two coefficients of the original $\beta$-function are scheme independent.
