<title>
Chiral Condensate and Short-Time Evolution of QCD(1+1) on the Light-Cone
</title>

<abstract>
  Chiral condensates in the trivial light-cone vacuum emerge if defined as
short-time limits of fermion propagators. In gauge theories, the necessary
inclusion of a gauge string in combination with the characteristic light-cone
infrared singularities contain the relevant non-perturbative ingredients
responsible for formation of the condensate, as demonstrated for the 't Hooft
model.
