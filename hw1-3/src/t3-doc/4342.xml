On Vertex Operator Construction of Quantum Affine Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the construction of the quantum deformed affine Lie algebras
using the vertex operators in the free field theory. We prove the Serre
relations for the quantum deformed Borel subalgebras of affine algebras, namely
the case of $ \hat{\it sl}_{2}$ is considered in details. We provide the
formulas for generators of affine algebra.
