<title>
General Triplectic Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  The general structure of the Sp(2) covariant version of the field-antifield
quantization of general constrained systems in the Lagrangian formalism, the so
called triplectic quantization, as presented in our previous paper with
A.M.Semikhatov is further generalized and clarified.
 We present new unified expressions for the generating operators which are more
invariant and which yield a natural realization of the operator V^a and provide
for a geometrical explanation for its presence. This V^a operator provides then
for an invariant definition of a degenerate Poisson bracket on the triplectic
manifold being nondegenerate on a naturally defined submanifold. We also
define inverses to nondegenerate antitriplectic metrics and give a natural
generalization of the conventional calculus of exterior differential forms
which e g explains the properties of these inverses. Finally we define and give
a consistent treatment of second class hyperconstraints.
