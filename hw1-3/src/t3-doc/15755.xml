Derivative Corrections from Noncommutativity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that an infinite subset of the higher-derivative alpha' corrections
to the DBI and Chern-Simons actions of ordinary commutative open-string theory
can be determined using noncommutativity. Our predictions are compared to some
lowest order alpha' corrections that have been computed explicitly by Wyllard
(hep-th/0008125), and shown to agree.
