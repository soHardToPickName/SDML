Symplectic Structures and Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  Canonical coordinates for the Schr\"odinger equation are introduced, making
more transparent its Hamiltonian structure. It is shown that the Schr\"odinger
equation, considered as a classical field theory, shares with Liouville
completely integrable field theories the existence of a {\sl recursion
operator} which allows for the infinitely many conserved functionals pairwise
commuting with respect to the corresponding Poisson bracket. The approach may
provide a good starting point to get a clear interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics in the general setting, provided by Stone-von Neumann theorem, of
Symplectic Mechanics. It may give new tools to solve in the general case the
inverse problem of quantum mechanics whose solution is given up to now only for
one-dimensional systems by the Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko formula.
