Generalized partition functions, interpolating statistics and higher
  virial coefficients
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from determinants at finite temperature obeying an intermediate
boundary condition between the periodic (bosonic) and antiperiodic (fermionic)
cases, we find results which can be mapped onto the ones obtained from anyons
for the second virial coefficient. Using this approach, we calculate the
corresponding higher virial coefficients and compare them with the results
known in the literature.
