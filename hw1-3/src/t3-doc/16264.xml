<title>
The Low-Energy Dynamics of N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories with Small Matter
  Content
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe the low-energy dynamics of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with
the Dynkin index of matter fields less than or equal to the Dynkin index of the
adjoint plus two. We explain what kinds of nonperturbative phenomena take place
in this class of supersymmetric gauge theories.
