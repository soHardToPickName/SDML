Dynamical Structure of Irregular Constrained Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Hamiltonian systems with functionally dependent constraints (irregular
systems), for which the standard Dirac procedure is not directly applicable,
are discussed. They are classified according to their behavior in the vicinity
of the constraint surface into two fundamental types. If the irregular
constraints are multilinear (type I), then it is possible to regularize the
system so that the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions are equivalent. When
the constraints are power of a linear function (type II), regularization is not
always possible and the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions may be
dynamically inequivalent. It is shown that the inequivalence between the two
formalisms can occur if the kinetic energy is an indefinite quadratic form in
the velocities. It is also shown that a system of type I can evolve in time
from a regular configuration into an irregular one, without any catastrophic
consequences.
