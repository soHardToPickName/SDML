Quantum Group and Quantum Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a self-contained review on the theory of quantum group and its
applications to modern physics. A brief introduction is given to the
Yang-Baxter equation in integrable quantum field theory and lattice statistical
physics. The quantum group is primarily introduced as a systematic method for
solving the Yang-Baxter equation. Quantum group theory is presented within the
framework of quantum double through quantizing Lie bi-algebra. Both the highest
weight and the cyclic representations are investigated for the quantum group
and emphasis is laid on the new features of representations for $q$ being a
root of unity. Quantum symmetries are explored in selected topics of modern
physics.
