Supersymmetry and Dualities
</title>

<abstract>
  Duality transformations with respect to rotational isometries relate
supersymmetric with non-supersymmetric backgrounds in string theory. We find
that non-local world-sheet effects have to be taken into account in order to
restore supersymmetry at the string level. The underlying superconformal
algebra remains the same, but in this case T-duality relates local with
non-local realizations of the algebra in terms of parafermions. This is another
example where stringy effects resolve paradoxes of the effective field theory.
