A Bilocal Field Theory in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A bilocal field theory having M\"{o}bius gauge invariance is proposed. In
four dimensions there exists a zero momentum state of the first quantized
model, which belongs to a non-trivial BRS cohomology class. A field theory
lagrangian having a gauge invariance only in four dimensions is constructed.
