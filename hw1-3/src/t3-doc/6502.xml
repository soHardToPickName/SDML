<title>
A local and integrable lattice regularization of the massive Thirring
  model
</title>

<abstract>
  The light--cone lattice approach to the massive Thirring model is
reformulated using a local and integrable lattice Hamiltonian written in terms
of discrete fermi fields. Several subtle points concerning boundary conditions,
normal--ordering, continuum limit, finite renormalizations and decoupling of
fermion doublers are elucidated. The relations connecting the six--vertex
anisotropy and the various coupling constants of the continuum are analyzed in
detail.
