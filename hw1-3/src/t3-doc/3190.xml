On the Super Higgs Effect in Extended Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the reduction of supersymmetry in N-extended four dimensional
supergravity via the super Higgs mechanism in theories without cosmological
constant. We provide an analysis largely based on the properties of long and
short multiplets of Poincare' supersymmetry. Examples of the super Higgs
phenomenon are realized in spontaneously broken N=8 supergravity through the
Scherk-Schwarz mechanism and in superstring compactification in presence of
brane fluxes. In many models the massive vectors count the difference in number
of the translation isometries of the scalar sigma-model geometries in the
broken and unbroken phase.
