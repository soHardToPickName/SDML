Boson Expansion Methods in (1+1)-dimensional Light-Front QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a bosonic Hamiltonian from two dimensional QCD on the light-front.
To obtain the bosonic theory we find that it is useful to apply the boson
expansion method which is the standard technique in quantum many-body physics.
We introduce bilocal boson operators to represent the gauge-invariant quark
bilinears and then local boson operators as the collective states of the
bilocal bosons. If we adopt the Holstein-Primakoff type among various
representations, we obtain a theory of infinitely many interacting bosons,
whose masses are the eigenvalues of the 't Hooft equation. In the large $N$
limit, since the interaction disappears and the bosons are identified with
mesons, we obtain a free Hamiltonian with infinite kinds of mesons.
