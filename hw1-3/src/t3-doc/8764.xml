An Extreme Black Hole with Electric Dipole Moment
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a new extreme black hole solution in toroidally compactified
heterotic string theory. The black hole saturates the Bogomol'nyi bound, has
zero angular momentum, but nonzero electric dipole moment. It is obtained by
starting with a higher dimensional rotating charged black hole, and
compactifying one direction in the plane of rotation.
