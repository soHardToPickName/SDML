Particle-vortex dynamics in noncommutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the problem of a charged particle in the presence of a uniform
magnetic field plus a vortex in noncommutative planar space considering the two
possible non-commutative extensions of the corresponding Hamiltonian, namely
the ``fundamental'' and the ``antifundamental'' representations. Using a Fock
space formalism we construct eigenfunctions and eigenvalues finding in each
case half of the states existing in the ordinary space case. In the limit of
$\theta \to 0$ we recover the two classes of states found in ordinary space,
relevant for the study of anyon physics.
