<title>
Konishi anomaly approach to gravitational F-terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We study gravitational corrections to the effective superpotential in
theories with a single adjoint chiral multiplet, using the generalized Konishi
anomaly and the gravitationally deformed chiral ring. We show that the genus
one correction to the loop equation in the corresponding matrix model agrees
with the gravitational corrected anomaly equations in the gauge theory. An
important ingrediant in the proof is the lack of factorization of chiral gauge
invariant operators in presence of a supergravity background. We also find a
genus zero gravitational correction to the superpotential, which can be removed
by a field redefinition.
