On N=2 SUSY gauge theories and integrable systems
</title>

<abstract>
  This note gives a brief review of the integrable structures presented in the
Seiberg-Witten approach to the N=2 SUSY gauge theories with emphasize on the
case of the gauge theories with matter hypermultiplets included (described by
spin chains). The web of different N=2 SUSY theories is discussed.
