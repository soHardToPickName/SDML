<title>
Ambiguity in the evaluation of the effective action on the cone
</title>

<abstract>
  An ambiguity in the computation of the one-loop effective action for fields
living on a cone is illustrated. It is shown that the ambiguity arises due to
the non-commutativity of the regularization of ultraviolet and (conical)
boundary divergencies.
