<title>
On the overlap formulation of chiral gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The overlap formula proposed by Narayanan and Neuberger in chiral gauge
theories is examined. The free chiral and Dirac Green's functions are
constructed in this formalism. Four dimensional anomalies are calculated and
the usual anomaly cancellation for one standard family of quarks and leptons is
verified.
