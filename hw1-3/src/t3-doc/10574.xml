Puzzles on the Duality between Heterotic and Type IIA Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility of the extension of the duality between the webs
of heterotic string and the type IIA string to Calabi-Yau 3-folds with another
K3 fiber by comparing the dual polyhedron of Calabi-Yau 3-folds given by
Candelas, Perevalov and Rajesh.
