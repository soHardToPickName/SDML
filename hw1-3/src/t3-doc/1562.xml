<title>
A 1D Model for N-level Atoms Coupled to an EM Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a model for n-level atoms coupled to quantized electromagnetic
fields in a fibrillar geometry. In the slowly varying envelope and rotating
wave approximations, the equations of motion are shown to satisfy a zero
curvature representation, implying integrability of the quantum system.
