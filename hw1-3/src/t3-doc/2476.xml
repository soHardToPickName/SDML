The Das-Popowicz Moyal Momentum Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce in this short note some aspects of the Moyal momentum algebra
that we call the Das-Popowicz Mm algebra. Our interest on this algebra is
motivated by the central role that it can play in the formulation of integrable
models and in higher conformal spin theories.
