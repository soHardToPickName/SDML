Coset Symmetries in Dimensionally Reduced Bosonic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the dimensional reduction of various effective actions,
particularly that of the closed Bosonic string and pure gravity, to two and
three dimensions. The result for the closed Bosonic string leads to coset
symmetries which are in agreement with those recently predicted and argued to
be present in a new unreduced formulation of this theory. We also show that
part of the Geroch group appears in the unreduced duality symmetric formulation
of gravity recently proposed. We conjecture that this formulation can be
extended to a non-linear realisation based on a Kac-Moody algebra which we
identify. We also briefly discuss the proposed action of Bosonic M-theory.
