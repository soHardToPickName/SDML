<title>
Determinant representation for dynamical correlation functions of the
  Quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The foundation for the theory of correlation functions of exactly solvable
models is determinant representation. Determinant representation permit to
describe correlation functions by classical completely integrable
differential equations [Barough, McCoy, Wu]. In this paper we show that
determinant represents works not only for free fermionic models. We obtained
determinant representation for the correlation function
$<\psi(0,0)\psi^\dagger(x,t)>$ of the quantum nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation, out of free fermionic point. In the forthcoming publications we
shall derive completely integrable equation and asymptotic for the quantum
correlation function of this model of interacting fermions.
