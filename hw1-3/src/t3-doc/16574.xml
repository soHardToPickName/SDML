<title>
Low-Temperature Expansions and Correlation Functions of the Z_3-Chiral
  Potts Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Using perturbative methods we derive new results for the spectrum and
correlation functions of the general Z_3-chiral Potts quantum chain in the
massive low-temperature phase. Explicit calculations of the ground state energy
and the first excitations in the zero momentum sector give excellent
approximations and confirm the general statement that the spectrum in the
low-temperature phase of general Z_n-spin quantum chains is identical to one in
the high-temperature phase where the role of charge and boundary conditions are
interchanged. Using a perturbative expansion of the ground state for the Z_3
model we are able to gain some insight in correlation functions. We argue that
they might be oscillating and give estimates for the oscillation length as well
as the correlation length.
