<title>
Generalized Wavefunctions for Correlated Quantum Oscillators I: Basic
  Formalism and Classical Antecedants
</title>

<abstract>
  In this first of a series of four articles, it is shown how a hamiltonian
quantum dynamics can be formulated based on a generalization of classical
probability theory using the notion of quasi-invariant measures on the
classical phase space, based on distributions rather than invariant Gibbs
measures. The first quantization is by functorial analytic continuation of real
probability amplitudes, effecting the introduction of correlation between
otherwise independent subsystems, and whose physical consequence is the
incorporation of Breit-Wigner resonances associated to Gamow vectors into our
description of dynamics. The resulting quantum distribution density dynamics
has a natural field theory interpretation, the subject for future installments
of this series.
