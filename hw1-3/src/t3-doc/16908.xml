<title>
Light-cone Quantum Mechanics of the Eleven-dimensional Superparticle
</title>

<abstract>
  The linearized interactions of eleven-dimensional supergravity are obtained
in a manifestly supersymmetric light-cone gauge formalism. These vertices are
used to calculate certain one-loop processes involving external gravitini,
antisymmetric three-form potentials and gravitons, thereby determining some
protected terms in the effective action of M-theory compactified on a
two-torus.
