<title>
Abelian Duality and Abelian Wilson Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a pure U(1) quantum gauge field theory on a general Riemannian
compact four manifold. We compute the partition function with Abelian Wilson
loop insertions. We find its duality covariance properties and derive
topological selection rules. Finally, we show that, to have manifest duality,
one must assume the existence of twisted topological sectors besides the
standard untwisted one.
