<title>
A Renormalized Supersymmetry in the Topological Yang-Mills Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the algebraic BRS renormalization of Witten's topological
Yang-Mills field theory by making use of a vector supersymmetry Ward identity
which improves the finiteness properties of the model. The vector
supersymmetric structure is a common feature of several topological theories.
The most general local counterterm is determined and is shown to be a trivial
BRS-coboundary.
