On Solutions of Tetrahedron Equations based on Korepanov Mechanism
</title>

<abstract>
  We have examined solutions of tetrahedron equations from the elliptic free
fermion model by using Korepanov mechanism based on tetrahedral Zamolodchikov
algebras. As a byproduct, we have found a new integrable 2-dim. lattice model.
We have also studied the relation between tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebras
and tetrahedron equations.
