<title>
The quantum 2-dimensional Poincare group from quantum group contraction
</title>

<abstract>
  A new derivation of the quantum deformation of the 2 dimensional Euclidean
Poincare group (cf S. Zakrzewski) is proposed. It is based on a contraction of
the Hopf algebra Fun(SO_q(3)). The deformation parameter q is sent to one, as
in the construction of the $\kappa$-Poincare deformed algebra. The quantum
group obtained is dual to that algebra.
