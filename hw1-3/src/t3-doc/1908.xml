<title>
Quantum boundary currents for nonsimply-laced Toda theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the quantum integrability of nonsimply--laced affine Toda theories
defined on the half--plane and explicitly construct the first nontrivial
higher--spin charges in specific examples. We find that, in contradistinction
to the classical case, addition of total derivative terms to the "bulk" current
plays a relevant role for the quantum boundary conservation.
