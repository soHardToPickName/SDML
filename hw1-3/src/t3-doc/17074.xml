Screening in three-dimensional QED
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the quark-antiquark potential in three dimensional massive Quantum
Electrodynamics. The result indicates that screening prevails for large quark
masses, contrary to the classical expectations. The classical result is
reproduced for small separation of the quarks.
