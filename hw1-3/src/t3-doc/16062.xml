<title>
Twist decomposition of nonlocal light-ray operators and harmonic tensor
  functions
</title>

<abstract>
  For arbitrary spacetime dimension a systematic procedure is carried on to
uniquely decompose nonlocal light-cone operators into harmonic operators of
well defined twist. Thereby, harmonic tensor polynomials up to rank 2 are
introduced. Symmetric tensor operators of rank 2 are considered as an example.
