M-Theory Origin of Mirror Symmetry in Three Dimensional Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We present M-theory compactifications on $K_3 \times K_3$ with membranes near
the $A_n$ or $D_n$ singularities of the $K_3$ spaces. By realizing each of
these compactifications in two different ways as type I' models with 2- and
6-branes, we explain the three-dimensional duality between gauge theories
recently found by Intriligator and Seiberg. We also find new pairs of dual
gauge theories, which we briefly describe.
