<title>
Non-Supersymmetric Large N Gauge Theories from Type 0 Brane
  Configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  We use dyonic brane configurations of type 0 string theory to study large N
non-supersymmetric 4d gauge theories. The brane configurations define theories
similar to the supersymmetric ones which arise in type II. We find the non-SUSY
analogues of N=2 and N=1. In particular we suggest new non-SUSY CFT's and a
brane realization of a non-SUSY Seiberg duality.
