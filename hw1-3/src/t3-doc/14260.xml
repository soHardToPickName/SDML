Bethe ansatz solution of the $Osp(1|2n)$ invariant spin chain
</title>

<abstract>
We have applied the analytical Bethe ansatz approach in order to solve the
$Osp(1|2n)$ invariant magnet. By using the Bethe ansatz equations we have
calculated the ground state energy and the low-lying dispersion relation. The
finite size properties indicate that the model has a central charge $c=n$.
