<title>
Spontaneous breaking of color in N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory without
  matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that in the pure N=1 Super Yang-Mills theory gauge symmetry is
spontaneously broken to the maximal Abelian subgroup. In particular, colored
gluino condensate is nonzero. It invalidates, in a subtle way, the so-called
strong-coupling instanton calculation of the (normal) gluino condensate and
resolves the long-standing paradox why its value does not agree with that
obtained by other methods.
