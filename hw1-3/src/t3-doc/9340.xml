<title>
General graviton exchange graph for four point functions in the AdS/CFT
  correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we explicitly compute the graviton exchange graph for scalar
fields with arbitrary conformal dimension \Delta in arbitrary spacetime
dimension d. This results in an analytical function in \Delta as well as in d.
