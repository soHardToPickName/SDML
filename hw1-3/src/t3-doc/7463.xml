<title>
The electrically charged BTZ black hole with self(anti-self) dual
  Maxwell field
</title>

<abstract>
  The Einstein-Maxwell equations with a negative cosmological constant in 2+1
spacetime dimensions discussed by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli are solved by
assuming a self(anti-self)dual equation. The solution describes an electrically
charged extreme black hole with an angular momentum.
