<title>
Non-analyticity in the large N renormalization group
</title>

<abstract>
  The flow of the action induced by changing $N$ is computed in large $N$
matrix models. It is shown that the change in the action is non-analytic. This
non-analyticity appears at the origin of the space of matrices if the action is
even.
