<title>
On the realization of chiral four-dimensional gauge theories using
  branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a general brane construction for realizing chiral
four-dimensional gauge theories. The advantage of the construction is the
simplicity and the possibility of realizing a large class of models existing in
the literature. We start the study of these models by determining the matter
content and the superpotential which naturally arise in the brane construction.
