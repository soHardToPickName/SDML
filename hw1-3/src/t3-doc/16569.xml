<title>
Self-Adjointness of the Dirac Hamiltonian and Vacuum Quantum Numbers
  Induced by a Singular External Field
</title>

<abstract>
  Effects of fermion-vacuum polarization by a singular configuration of an
external static vector field are considered in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.
Expressions for the induced vacuum charge and magnetic flux are obtained.
