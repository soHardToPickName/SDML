<title>
High energy QCD as a completely integrable model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the one-dimensional lattice model proposed by Lipatov to
describe the high energy scattering of hadrons in multicolor QCD is completely
integrable. We identify this model as the XXX Heisenberg chain of noncompact
spin $s=0$ and find the conservation laws of the model. A generalized Bethe
ansatz is developed for the diagonalization of the hamiltonian and for the
calculation of hadron-hadron scattering amplitude.
