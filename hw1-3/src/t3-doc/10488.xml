Thermodynamics of non-abelian exclusion statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  The thermodynamic potential of ideal gases described by the simplest
non-abelian statistics is investigated. I show that the potential is the linear
function of the element of the abelian-part statistics matrix. Thus, the
factorizable property in the Haldane (abelian) fractional exclusion shown by
the author [W. H. Huang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 2392 (1998)] is now extended to
the non-abelian case. The complete expansion of the thermodynamic potential is
also given.
