On the Hopf structure of $U_{p,q}(gl(1|1))$ and the universal ${\cal
  T}$-matrix of $Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1))$
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the technique developed by Fronsdal and Galindo (Lett. Math. Phys. 27
(1993) 57) for studying the Hopf duality between the quantum algebras
$Fun_{p,q}(GL(2))$ and $U_{p,q}(gl(2))$, the Hopf structure of
$U_{p,q}(gl(1|1))$, dual to $Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1))$, is derived and the
corresponding universal ${\cal T}$-matrix of $Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1))$, embodying
the suitably modified exponential relationship $U_{p,q}(gl(1|1))$ $\rightarrow$
$Fun_{p,q}(GL(1|1))$, is obtained.
