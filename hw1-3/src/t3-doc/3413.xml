Consistent and covariant anomalies in six-dimensional supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we clarify some issues in six-dimensional (1,0) supergravity
coupled to vector and tensor multiplets. In particular, we show that, while the
low-energy equations embody tensor-vector couplings that contribute only to
gauge anomalies, the divergence of the energy-momentum tensor is properly
non-vanishing. In addition, we show how to revert to a supersymmetric
formulation in terms of covariant non-integrable field equations that embody
corresponding covariant anomalies.
