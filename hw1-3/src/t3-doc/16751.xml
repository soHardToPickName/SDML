<title>
Holography for Coset Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  M/string theory on noncompact, negatively curved, cosets which generalize
$AdS_{D+1}=SO(D,2)/SO(D,1)$ is considered. Holographic descriptions in terms of
a conformal field theory on the boundary of the spacetime are proposed.
Examples include $SU(2,1)/U(2)$, which is a Euclidean signature (4,0) space
with no supersymmetry, and $SO(2,2)/SO(2)$ and $SO(3,2)/SO(3)$, which are
Lorentzian signature (4,1) and (6,1) spaces with eight supersymmetries.
Qualitatively new features arise due to the degenerate nature of the conformal
boundary metric.
