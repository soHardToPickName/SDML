Low Temperature Expansion of Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to expand the free energy of a matrix model coupled to arbitrary
matter in powers of the matter coupling constant. Concentrating on $\nu$
uncoupled Ising models---which have central charge $\nu/2$---we work out the
expansion to sixth order for $\nu$ = 1, 2, and 3. Analyzing the series by the
ratio method, we exhibit the spin-ordering phase transition. We discuss the
limit $\nu \rightarrow \infty$, which is especially clear in the low
temperature expansion; we prove that in this limit the dependence of the model
on $\nu$ becomes trivial.
