The incident wave in Aharonov-Bohm scattering wavefunction
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that only the infinite angular momentum quantum states contribute
to the incident wave in Aharonov-Bohm (AB) scattering. This result is clearly
shown by recalculating the AB calculation with arbitrary decomposition of
summation over the angular momentum quantum numbers in wave function. It is
motivated from the fact that the pole contribution in the integral
representation used by Jackiw is given by only the infinite angular momentum
states, in which the closed contour integration involving this pole gives just
the incident wave.
