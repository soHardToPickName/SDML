<title>
Direct solution of the hard pomeron problem for arbitrary conformal
  weight
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method is applied to solve the Baxter equation for the one dimensional
system of noncompact spins. Dynamics of such an ensemble is equivalent to that
of a set of reggeized gluons exchanged in the high energy limit of QCD
amplitudes. The technique offers more insight into the old calculation of the
intercept of hard Pomeron, and provides new results in the odderon channel.
