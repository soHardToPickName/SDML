String Corrections to the Hawking-Page Phase Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the O(alpha'^3) corrections to the AdS_5 Black hole metric in type
IIB string theory. Contrary to previous work in this direction we keep the
Black Hole radius finite. Thus the topology of the boundary is S^3 x S^1. We
find the corrections to the free energy and the critical temperature of the
phase transition.
