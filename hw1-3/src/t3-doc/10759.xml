<title>
Algebraic Structure in 0<c<1 Open-Closed String Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply stochastic quantization method to Kostov's matrix-vector models for
the second quantization of orientable strings with Chan-Paton like factors,
including both open and closed strings. The Fokker-Planck hamiltonian deduces
an orientable open-closed string field theory at the double scaling limit.
There appears an algebraic structure in the continuum F-P hamiltonian including
a Virasoro algebra and a SU(r) current algebra.
