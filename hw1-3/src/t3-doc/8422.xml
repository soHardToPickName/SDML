<title>
W_infty Structures of 2D String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The Ward identities of the $W_{\infty}$ symmetry in 2D string theory in the
tachyon background are studied in the continuum approach. Comparing the
solutions with the matrix model results, it is verified that 2D string
amplitudes are different from the matrix model amplitudes only by the external
leg factors even in higher genus. This talk is based on the recent work [1] and
also [2] for the $c_M <1$ model. (Talk given at the workshop on ``Frontiers in
Quantum Field Theory'', Osaka, Japan, December 1995.)
