<title>
Non-commutative Oscillators and the commutative limit
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown in first order perturbation theory that anharmonic oscillators in
non-commutative space behave smoothly in the commutative limit just as harmonic
oscillators do. The non-commutativity provides a method for converting a
problem in degenerate perturbation theory to a non-degenerate problem.
