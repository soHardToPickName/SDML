Continuum limit(s) of BMN matrix model: Where is the (nonabelian) gauge
  group?
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the continuum limits of Berenstein-Maldacena-Nastase matrix model.
They give rise to Poisson bracket gauge field theories on the ordinary two
sphere or on a set of two spheres with a gauge groups U(n) depending on the
degeneracy of the classical solution about which the model is considered. We
show that these models fail to be equivalent among each other in the continuum
limit.
