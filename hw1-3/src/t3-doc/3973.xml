<title>
Product Einstein Manifolds, Zeta-Function Regularization and the
  Multiplicative Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  The global additive and multiplicative properties of Laplace type operators
acting on irreducible rank 1 symmetric spaces are considered. The explicit form
of the zeta function on product spaces and of the multiplicative anomaly is
derived.
