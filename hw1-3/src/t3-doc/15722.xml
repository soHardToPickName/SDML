Type-I vacua and brane transmutation
</title>

<abstract>
  In a classic paper, Fradkin and Tseytlin showed how magnetic deformations can
be introduced in open strings. In this contribution we review some recent work
on type-I vacua with magnetised branes and describe the role of additional
discrete deformations, related to quantised values of the NS-NS antisymmetric
tensor B_ab.
