<title>
de Rham cohomology of SO(n) and some related manifolds by supersymmetric
  quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  We study supersymmetric quantum mechanics on RP_{n},SO(n),G_{2} and U(2) to
examine Witten's Morse theory concretely. We confirm the simple instanton
picture of the de Rham cohomology that has been given in a previous paper. We
use a reflection symmetry of each theory to select the true vacuums. The number
of selected vacuums agrees with the de Rham cohomology for each of the above
manifolds.
