Grand Unification from Gauge Theory on $M_4 \times Z_N$
</title>

<abstract>
  The SU(5) grand unified theory (GUT) is derived from the geometrical point of
view of gauge theory on three-sheeted space-time, i.e., $M_4 \times Z_3$
manifold without recourse to noncommutative geometry. A derivation of SO(10)
GUT is also discussed in the same point of view.
