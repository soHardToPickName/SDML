<title>
Correlators of open D-string theory from supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a minimally coupled massless scalar propagating in the background
of NS5-branes in the presence of a 2-form RR electric field. The supergravity
solution also called the (NS5,D1) bound state in the appropriate decoupling
limit is the holographic dual of Open D-string (OD1) theory. Using this
information, we compute the two-point function of the operators in OD1 theory
which couples to the massless string states such as the dilaton. We will
indicate how to obtain the absorption cross-section of a scalar on NS5-branes
(i.e. Little String Theory (LST)) obtained earlier, from our results in the
low-energy limit.
