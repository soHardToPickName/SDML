<title>
Elliptic quantum groups
</title>

<abstract>
  This note for the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematical
Physics gives an account of a construction of an ``elliptic quantum group''
associated with each simple classical Lie algebra. It is closely related to
elliptic face models of statistical mechanics, and, in its semiclassical limit,
to the Wess-Zumino-Witten model of conformal field theory on tori.
