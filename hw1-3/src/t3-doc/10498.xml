<title>
Gravitation as a Many Body Problem
</title>

<abstract>
  The idea of viewing gravitation as a many body phenomenon is put forward
here. Physical arguments supporting this idea are briefly reviewed. The basic
mathematical object of the new gravitational mechanics is a matrix of
operators. Striking similarity of the method of R-matrix (QISM) to the
mathematical formulation of the new gravitational mechanics is pointed out. The
s-wave difference Schrodinger equation describing a process of emission of
radiation by a gravitating particle is shown to be analogous to the Baxter
equation of the QISM.
