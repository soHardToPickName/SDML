Solitons in Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger Model and the Collective Ground
  State of One-Dimensional Delta-Function Gas
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine one-dimensional Bose gas interacting with delta-function potential
using the large-$N$ collective field theory. We show that in the case of
attractive potential the uniform ground state is unstable to small
perturbations and the instability is cured by formation of a collective ground
state, \lq\lq bright soliton'' configuration in corresponding nonlinear
Schr\"odinger field theory.
