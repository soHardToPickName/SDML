<title>
The State of Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a brief description of what has been accomplished and what remains to
be done in the construction of a nonperturbative formulation of "The Theory
Formerly Known as String". It is culled from two short talks given by the
author at SUSY 97 and Strings 97.
