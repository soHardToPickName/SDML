<title>
The Canonical Structure of Wess-Zumino-Witten Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The phase space of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model on a circle with target space
a compact, connected, semisimple Lie group $G$ is defined and the corresponding
symplectic form is given. We present a careful derivation of the Poisson
brackets of the Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We also study the canonical structure
of the supersymmetric and the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten models.
