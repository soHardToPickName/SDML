<title>
On the Renormalization of a Bosonized Version of the Chiral
  Fermion-Meson Model at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  Feynman's functional formulation of statistical mechanics is used to study
the renormalizability of the well known Linear Chiral Sigma Model in the
presence of fermionic fields at finite temperature in an alternative way. It is
shown that the renormalization conditions coincide with those of the zero
temperature model.
