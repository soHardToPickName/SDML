Supersymmetry and DLCQ
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk we describe the application of discrete light cone quantization
(DLCQ) to supersymmetric field theories. We find that it is possible to
formulate DLCQ so that supersymmetry is exactly preserved in the discrete
approximation and call this formulation of DLCQ, SDLCQ. It combines the power
of DLCQ with all of the beauty of supersymmetry. We have applied SDLCQ to
several interesting supersymmetric theories and discussed zero modes, vacuum
degeneracy, massless states, mass gaps, and theories in higher dimensions. Most
recently we have used it to discuss the Maldacena conjecture.
