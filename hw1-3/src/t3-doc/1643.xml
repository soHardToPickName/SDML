Nonlocal low-energy effective action for gravity with torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we calculate the low-energy effective action for gravity with
torsion, obtained after the integration of scalar and fermionic matter fields,
using the local momentum representation based on the Riemann normal coordinates
expansion. By considering this expansion around different space-time points, we
also compute the nonlocal terms together with the more usual divergent ones.
Finally we discuss the applicability of our results to the calculation of
particle production probabilities.
