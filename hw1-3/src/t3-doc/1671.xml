Bosonic Fields with Two Mass and Spin States
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the bosonic fields which describe a particle which may exist in
states with spins one and zero with different masses. All the linearly
independent solutions of the equation for a free particle are obtained in the
form of the projection matrix-dyads (density-matrices). The interaction with
anomalous magnetic dipole and quadruple electric moments of a particle is
studied. The Hamiltonian form of the first order equation has been
investigated.
