Methods for Generating Quasi-Exactly Solvable Potentials
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe three different methods for generating quasi-exactly solvable
potentials, for which a finite number of eigenstates are analytically known.
The three methods are respectively based on (i) a polynomial ansatz for wave
functions; (ii) point canonical transformations; (iii) supersymmetric quantum
mechanics. The methods are rather general and give considerably richer results
than those available in the current literature.
