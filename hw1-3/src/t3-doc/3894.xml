<title>
Interactions in the SL(2,R)/U(1) Black Hole Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate two- and three-point tachyon amplitudes of the SL(2,R)/U(1)
two-dimensional Euclidean black hole for spherical topologies in the continuum
approach proposed by Bershadsky and Kutasov. We find an interesting relation to
the tachyon scattering amplitudes of standard non-critical string theory.
