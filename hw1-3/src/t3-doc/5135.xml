<title>
Supersymmetic Extension of the Non-Abelian Scalar-Tensor Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  The field theory dual to the Freedman-Townsend model of a non-Abelian
anti-symmetric tensor field is a nonlinear sigma model on the group manifold G.
This can be extended to the duality between the Freedman-Townsend model coupled
to Yang-Mills fields and a nonlinear sigma model on a coset space G/H. We
present the supersymmetric extension of this duality, and find that the target
space of this nonlinear sigma model is a complex coset space, GC/HC.
