Lattice quantization of Yangian charges
</title>

<abstract>
  By placing theories with Yangian charges on the lattice in the analogue of
the St Petersburg school's approach to the sine-Gordon system, we exhibit the
Yangian structure of the auxiliary algebra, and explain how the two Yangians
are related.
