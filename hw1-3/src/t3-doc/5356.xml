A Note on Holography on a Curved Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  Some recent literature has examined the holographic-induced cosmology of a
brane universe in the background of an anti-de Sitter-black hole geometry. In
this regard, curved-brane scenarios have begun to receive considerable
attention. Our current interest is in a formal discrepancy that exists between
two such works by Padilla (hep-th/0111247) and Youm (hep-th/0111276). In
particular, these authors have incorporated different values for a conformal
factor that is used to relate the thermodynamics of the relevant (AdS bulk and
CFT brane) spacetimes. After a more general review, we clarify this issue and
discuss the implications on the prior results.
