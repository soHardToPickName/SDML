<title>
Yang-Baxter Equation for $A^{(1)}_{n-1}$ Broken ${\Bf Z}_N $ Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a factorized representation of the $\frak g \frak l _n$-Sklyanin
algebra from the vertex-face correspondence. Using this representation, we
obtain a new solvable model which gives an $\frak s \frak l _n$-generalization
of the broken $\bz _N $ model. We further prove the Yang-Baxter equation for
this model.
