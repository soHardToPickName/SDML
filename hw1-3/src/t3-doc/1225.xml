Unified Octonionic Representation of the 10-13 Dimensional Clifford
  Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a one dimensional octonionic representation of the different Clifford
algebra Cliff(5,5)\sim Cliff(9,1), Cliff(6,6)\sim Cliff(10,2) and lastly
Cliff(7,6)\sim Cliff(10,3) which can be given by (8x8) real matrices taking
into account some suitable manipulation rules.
