<title>
Geometry of Fermionic Constraints in Superstring Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Considered are superparticle and superstring models invariant under
supersymmetry in a target superspace and local extended worldsheet
supersymmetry the latter replacing the fermionic $\kappa$--symmetry of the
conventional Green--Schwarz formulations. (Talk given at the Conference on
Geometry of Constrained Dynamical Systems,
  Cambridge, June 15-18, 1994).
