Periodic Instantons with non-trivial Holonomy
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the detailed derivation of the charge one periodic instantons - or
calorons - with non-trivial holonomy for SU(2). We use a suitable combination
of the Nahm transformation and ADHM techniques. Our results rely on our ability
to compute explicitly the relevant Green's function in terms of which the
solution can be conveniently expressed. We also discuss the properties of the
moduli space, R^3 X S^1 X Taub-NUT/Z_2 and its metric, relating the holonomy to
the Taub-NUT mass parameter. We comment on the monopole constituent description
of these calorons, how to retrieve topological charge in the context of abelian
projection and possible applications to QCD.
