<title>
Supergravity before and after 1976
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper is part of the lecture given at the TH Division of CERN and
devoted to the CXXV anniversary of the birthday of Elie Cartan (1869-1951). It
is shown how the methods of differential geometry, due to E. Cartan, were
applied to the construction of the supersymmetry transformation law and to the
actions for Goldstone fermions and supergravity.
