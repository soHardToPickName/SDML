<title>
Exact Solution for the Most General Minimally Coupled One Dimensional
  Lattice Gauge Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider one dimensional lattice gauge theories constructed by the minimal
coupling prescription. It is shown that these theories are exactly solvable in
the thermodynamic limit. After considering the most general case, we discuss
some special cases on finite lattices, and also work out some examples. There
is no phase transition in these minimally coupled theories.
