Invariants of 3-Manifolds Derived From Finite Dimensional Hopf Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper studies invariants of 3-manifolds derived from certain fin ite
dimensional Hopf algebras. The invariants are based on right integrals for
these algebras. It is shown that the resulting class of invariants is distinct
from the class of Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants.
