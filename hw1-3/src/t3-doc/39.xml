<title>
Brane-induced decay of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  The enhancement in the decay rate of the Kaluza-Klein vacuum due to the
presence of a brane is studied, both in the test brane approximation and beyond
it. Spontaneous brane materialization in the Kaluza-Klein vacuum is also
described.
