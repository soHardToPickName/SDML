<title>
Nonlinear Sigma Model for String Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that a renormalizable nonlinear sigma model gives rise to the
effective string theory proposed by Polchinski and Strominger. In the presence
of long string background, the model contains massive world-sheet degrees of
freedom owing to the spontaneous breaking of conformal invariance.
