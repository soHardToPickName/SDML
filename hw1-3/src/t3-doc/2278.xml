Type II Branes from Brane-Antibrane in M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss in a systematic way all the possible realisations of branes of M
and type II theories as topological solitons of a brane-antibrane system. The
classification of all the possibilities, consistent with the structure of the
theory, is achieved by studying the Wess-Zumino terms in the worldvolume
effective actions of the branes of M-theory and their reductions.
