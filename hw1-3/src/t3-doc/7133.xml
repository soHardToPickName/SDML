Anomaly Inflow for Gauge Defects
</title>

<abstract>
  Topological defects constructed out of scalar fields and possessing chiral
fermion zero modes are known to exhibit an anomaly inflow mechanism which
cancels the anomaly in the effective theory of the zero modes through an inflow
of current from the space in which the defect is embedded. We investigate the
analog of this mechanism for defects constructed out of gauge fields in higher
dimensions. In particular we analyze this mechanism for string (one-brane)
defects in six dimensions and for fivebranes in ten dimensions.}
