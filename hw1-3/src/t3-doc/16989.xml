<title>
Stochastic Processes and the Dirac Equation with External Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The equation describing the stochastic motion of a classical particle in
1+1-dimensional space-time is connected to the Dirac equation with external
gauge fields. The effects of assigning different turning probabilities to the
forward and the backward moving particles in time are discussed.
