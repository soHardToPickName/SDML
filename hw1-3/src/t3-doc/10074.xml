<title>
Light-Front QCD and the Constituent Quark Model
</title>

<abstract>
  A general strategy is described for deriving a constituent approximation to
QCD, inspired by the constituent quark model and based on light-front
quantization. Some technical aspects of the approach are discussed, including a
mechanism for obtaining a confining potential and ways in which spontaneous
chiral symmetry breaking can be manifested. (Based on a talk presented by K.G.
Wilson at ``Theory of Hadrons and Light-Front QCD,'' Polana Zgorzelisko,
Poland, August 1994.)
