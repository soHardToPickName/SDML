<title>
Superconducting phase transitions in 2+1 dimensional quantum field
  theories modeling generalized polaronic interactions. Part I: Jahn-Teller
  inspired models
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the fundamentals of Jahn-Teller interactions and their field
theoretical modelings and show that a 2+1 dimensional gauge theory where the
gauge field couples to "flavored fermions" arises in a natural way from a
two-band model describing the dynamical Jahn-Teller effect. The theory exhibits
a second order phase transition to novel finite-temperature superconductivity.
