Picture Changing Operators in Closed Fermionic String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss appropriate arrangement of picture changing operators required to
construct gauge invariant interaction vertices involving Neveu-Schwarz states
in heterotic and closed superstring field theory. The operators required for
this purpose are shown to satisfy a set of descent equations.
