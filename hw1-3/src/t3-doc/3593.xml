<title>
Matrix String Theory from Brane Configuration
</title>

<abstract>
  Configurations of fivebranes, twobranes and fourbranes in type IIA string
theory, which give (1+1) dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories in the low
energy limit, are constructed. It is shown that these brane configurations are
equivalent to a certain class of matrix string theories. This opens up an
avenue for the investigation of matrix string dynamics via the geometry of the
brane configurations in type IIA string theory.
