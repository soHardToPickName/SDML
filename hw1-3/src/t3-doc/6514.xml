Gauge corrections and FI-term in 5D KK theories
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of a five dimensional N=1 Kaluza Klein model compactified on
S_1/Z_2 x Z_2' we compute the one-loop gauge corrections to the self energy of
the (zero-mode) scalar field. The result is quadratically divergent due to the
appearance of a Fayet-Iliopoulos term.
