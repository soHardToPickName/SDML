About the kinematics of spinning particles
</title>

<abstract>
  Inserting the correct Lorentz factor into the definition of the 4-velocity
v^mu for spinning particles entails new kinematical properties for v^2. The
well-known constraint (identically true for scalar particles, but entering also
the Dirac theory, and assumed a priori in all spinning particle models) p_mu
v^mu = m is here derived in a self-consistent way.
