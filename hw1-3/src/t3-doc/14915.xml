<title>
Duality-Invariant Gaugino Condensation and One-Loop Corrected Kahler
  Potentials in String Theory, Dieter Lust and Carlos Munoz
</title>

<abstract>
  The duality-invariant gaugino condensation with or without massive matter
fields is re-analysed, taking into account the dependence of the string
threshold corrections on the moduli fields and recent results concerning
one-loop corrected K\"ahler potentials. The scalar potential of the theory for
a generic superpotential is also calculated.
