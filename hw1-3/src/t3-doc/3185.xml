Boundary Dynamics of Higher Dimensional Chern-Simons Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the relevance to the black hole entropy problem of boundary
dynamics in Chern-Simons gravity. We then describe a recent derivation of the
action induced on the four dimensional boundary in a five dimensional
Chern-Simons gravity theory with gauge invariant, anti-deSitter boundary
conditions.
