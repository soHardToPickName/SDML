<title>
First Are Last Fractional-Charge Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  Jackiw and Rebbi found two types of intrinsically stable or `fundamental'
soliton (kinks in 1+1 D and magnetic monopoles in 3+1 D) which can carry pieces
of elementary-particle charges. After two decades there are no more, and it is
argued here why that is inevitable.
