<title>
Effective Potential and KK-Renormalization Scheme in a 5D Supersymmetric
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the 1-loop effective potential in a supersymmetric model in 5D
with $S^1/(Z_2\times Z_2)$ orbifold compactification. The procedure of
calculation consists of evaluating first the integrals over four-momenta using
the dimensional regularization and then the sum over Kaluza-Klein modes using
the zeta-regularization. We show that both fermionic and bosonic contributions
are separately finite and argue that, supersymmetry is not necessary for the
finiteness of the theory at 1-loop. Also, some general arguments on the
finiteness of the theory with arbitrary number of extra dimensions are
presented.
