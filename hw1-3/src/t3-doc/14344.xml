<title>
A Generalized Higgs Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Higgs model is generalized so that in addition to the radial Higgs field
there are fields which correspond to the themasy and entropy. The model is
further generalized to include state and sign parameters. A reduction to the
standard Higgs model is given and how to break symmetry using a non-zero VEV
(vacuum expectation value) is shown. A 'fluid rotation' can be performed on the
standard Higgs model to give a model dependant on the entropy and themasy and
with a constant mass.
