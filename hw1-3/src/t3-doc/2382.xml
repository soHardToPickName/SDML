<title>
Superconformal 2D Minimal Models and an Unusual Coset Construction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a coset construction of minimal models. We define it rigorously
and prove that it gives superconformal minimal models. This construction allows
to build all primary fields of superconformal models and to calculate their
three-point correlation functions.
