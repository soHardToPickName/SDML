Quantum Creation of the Randall-Sundrum Bubble
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the semiclassical instability of the Randall-Sundrum brane
world. We carefully analyze the bubble solution with the Randall-Sundrum
background, which expresses the decay of the brane world. We evaluate the decay
probability following the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity.
Since a bubble rapidly expands after the nucleation, the entire spacetime will
be occupied by such bubbles.
