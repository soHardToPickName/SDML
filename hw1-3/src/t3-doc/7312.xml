<title>
A Polynomial Weyl Invariant Spinning Membrane Action
</title>

<abstract>
  A review of the construction of a Weyl-invariant spinning-membrane action
that is $polynomial$ in the fields, without a cosmological constant term,
comprised of quadratic and quartic-derivative terms, and where supersymmetry is
linearly realized, is presented. The action is invariant under a $modified$
supersymmetry transformation law which is derived from a new $ Q + K + S $
sum-rule based on the 3D-superconformal algebra .
