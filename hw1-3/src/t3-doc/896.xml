<title>
Degeneracy Structure of the Calogero-Sutherland Model: an Algebraic
  Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The degeneracy structure of the eigenspace of the N-particle
Calogero-Sutherland model is studied from an algebraic point of view. Suitable
operators satisfying SU(2) algebras and acting on the degenerate eigenspace are
explicitly constructed for the two particle case and then appropriately
generalized to the N-particle model. The raising and lowering operators of
these algebras connect the states, in a subset of the degenerate eigenspace,
with each other.
