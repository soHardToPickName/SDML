<title>
Conformal symmetry of the coupled Chern-Simons and gauged nonlinear
  Schr\"odinger equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-relativistic conformal symmetry found by Jackiw and Pi for the
coupled Chern-Simons and gauged nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in the plane
is derived in a non-relativistic Kaluza-Klein framework.
