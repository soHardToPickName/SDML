Elastic Parton-Parton Scattering from AdS/CFT
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the AdS/CFT correspondence and the eikonal approximation, we evaluate
the elastic parton-parton scattering amplitude at large $N$ and strong coupling
$g^2N$ in N=4 SYM. We obtain a scattering amplitude with a Regge behavior that
unitarizes at large $\sqrt{s}$.
