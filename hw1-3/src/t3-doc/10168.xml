Matrix Models, Topological Strings, and Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that B-model topological strings on local Calabi-Yau threefolds are
large N duals of matrix models, which in the planar limit naturally give rise
to special geometry. These matrix models directly compute F-terms in an
associated N=1 supersymmetric gauge theory, obtained by deforming N=2 theories
by a superpotential term that can be directly identified with the potential of
the matrix model. Moreover by tuning some of the parameters of the geometry in
a double scaling limit we recover (p,q) conformal minimal models coupled to 2d
gravity, thereby relating non-critical string theories to type II superstrings
on Calabi-Yau backgrounds.
