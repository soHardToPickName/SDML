Object picture of quasinormal ringing on the background of small
  Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigated the evolution of a scalar field propagating in small
Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes. The imaginary part of the quasinormal
frequency decreases with the horizon size and the real part of the quasinormal
frequency keeps nearly as a constant. The object-picture clarified the question
on the quasinormal modes for small Anti-de Sitter black holes. Dependence of
quasinormal modes on spacetime dimensions and the multipole index for small
Anti-de Sitter black holes have also been illustrated.
