Efficiency of swimming of micro-organism and singularity in shape space
</title>

<abstract>
  Micro-organisms can be classified into three different types according to
their size. We study the efficiency of the swimming of micro-organism in two
dimensional fluid as a device for helping the explanation of this hierarchy in
the size. We show that the efficiency of flagellate becomes unboundedly large,
whereas that of ciliate has the upper bound. The unboundedness is related to
the curious feature of the shape space, that is, a singularity at the basic
shape of flagellate.
