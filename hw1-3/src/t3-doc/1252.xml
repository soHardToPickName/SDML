<title>
A Bogomol`nyi equation for intersecting domain walls
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the Wess-Zumino model with quartic superpotential admits static
solutions in which three domain walls intersect at a junction. We derive an
energy bound for such junctions and show that configurations saturating it
preserve 1/4 supersymmetry.
