<title>
Grassmannian Cohomolgy Rings and Fusion Rings from Algebraic Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The potential that generates the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian is given
in terms of the elementary symmetric functions using the Waring formula that
computes the power sum of roots of an algebraic equation in terms of its
coefficients. As a consequence, the fusion potential for $su(N)_K$ is obtained.
This potential is the explicit Chebyshev polynomial in several variables of the
first kind. We also derive the fusion potential for $sp(N)_K$ from a reciprocal
algebraic equation. This potential is identified with another Chebyshev
polynomial in several variables. We display a connection between these fusion
potentials and generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.
