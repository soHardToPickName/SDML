On Explicit Evaluations Around the Conformal Point in N=2 Supersymmetric
  Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to give the expression for periods, Higgs field and its dual of
N=2 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory around the conformal point. This is
achieved by evaluating the integral representation in the weak coupling region,
and by using analytic continuation to the conformal point. The explicit
representation is shown for the SU(2) theory with matter fields and also for
pure SU(N) and pure SO(2N) theory around the conformal point where the relation
to the beta function of the theory is clarified. We also discuss a relation
between the fixed points in the SU(2) theories with matter fields and the
Landau-Ginzburg point of 2-D N=2 SCFT.
