Scaling Dimensions of Manifestly Generally Covariant Operators in
  Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Using (2+$\epsilon$)-dimensional quantum gravity recently formulated by
Kawai, Kitazawa and Ninomiya, we calculate the scaling dimensions of manifestly
generally covariant operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to
$(p,q)$ minimal conformal matter. Although the spectrum includes all the
scaling dimensions of the scaling operators in the matrix model except the
boundary operators, there are also many others which do not appear in the
matrix model. We argue that the partial agreement of the scaling dimensions
should be considered as accidental and that the operators considered give a new
series of operators in two-dimensional quantum gravity.
