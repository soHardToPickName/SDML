<title>
K3 Surfaces, Igusa Cusp Form and String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently become apparent that the elliptic genera of K3 surfaces (and
their symmetric products) are intimately related to the Igusa cusp form of
weight ten. In this contribution, I survey this connection with an emphasis on
string theoretic viewpoints.
