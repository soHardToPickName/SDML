<title>
Geometries of orthogonal groups and their contractions: a unified
  classical deformation viewpoint
</title>

<abstract>
  The geometries of spaces having as groups the real orthogonal groups and some
of their contractions are described from a common point of view. Their central
extensions and Casimirs are explicitly given. An approach to the trigonometry
of their spaces is also advanced.
