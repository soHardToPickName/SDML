<title>
Integrable Extension of Nonlinear Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose an integrable extension of nonlinear sigma model on the target
space of Hermitian symmetric space (HSS). Starting from a discussion of soliton
solutions of O(3) model and an integrally extended version of it, we construct
general theory defined on arbitrary HSS by using the coadjoint orbit method. It
is based on the exploitation of a covariantized canonical structure on HSS.
This term results in an additional first-order derivative term in the equation
of motion, which accommodates the zero curvature representation. Infinite
conservation laws of nonlocal charges in this model are derived.
