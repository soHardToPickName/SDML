Renormalization In Coupled-Abelian Self-Dual Chern-Simons Models
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic restriction of the nonabelian self-dual Chern-Simons-Higgs
systems leads to coupled-abelian self-dual models with intricate mass spectra.
The vacua are characterized by embeddings of SU(2) into the gauge algebra; and
in the broken phases, the gauge and real scalar masses are related to the
exponents of the gauge algebra. In this paper we compute the gauge-gauge-Higgs
couplings in the broken phases and use this to compute the finite
renormalizations of the Chern-Simons coefficient in the various vacua.
