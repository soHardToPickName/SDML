<title>
A New $N = 4$ Superconformal Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the previously known $N=3$ and $N=4$ superconformal algebras
can be contracted consistently by singular scaling of some of the generators.
For the later case, by a contraction which depends on the central term, we
obtain a new $N=4$ superconformal algebra which contains an $SU(2)\times
{U(1)}^4$ Kac-Moody subalgebra and has nonzero central extension.
