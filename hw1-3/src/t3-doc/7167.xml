<title>
Curved branes and cosmological (a,b)-models
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct p-brane solutions with non-trivial world volume metrics and show
that applied to supergravity theories, they will lead to threshold BPS bound
states of intersecting solutions. However applied to certain specific values of
the couplings in cosmological (a,b)-models non-trivial solutions can be
constructed.
