<title>
Modified Reconstruction of Standard Model in Non-Commutative
  Differential Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Sogami recently proposed the new idea to express Higgs particle as a kind of
gauge particle by prescribing the generalized covariant derivative with gauge
and Higgs fields operating on quark and lepton fields. The field strengths for
both the gauge and Higgs fields are defined by the commutators of the covariant
derivative by which he could obtain the Yang-Mills Higgs Lagrangian in the
standard model. Inspired by Sogami's work, we present a modification of our
previous scheme to formulate the spontaneously broken gauge theory in
non-commutative geometry on the discrete space; Minkowski space multiplied by
two points space by introducing the generation mixing matrix in operation of
the generalized derivative on the more fundamental fields a_i(x,y) which
compose the gauge and Higgs fields. The standard model is reconstructed
according to the modified scheme, which does not yields not only any special
relations between the particle masses but also the special restriction on the
Higgs potential.
