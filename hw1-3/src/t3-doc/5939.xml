<title>
Effective Lagrangian and static black holes in 2D dilatonic gravity
  inspired by quantum effects
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the effective action in 2D dilaton-Maxwell quantum gravity. Working
with the one-loop renormalizable subset of such theories, we construct the
improved effective Lagrangian which contains curvature under logarithm. This
effective Lagrangian leads to new classical dilatonic gravity inspired by
quantum effects. The static black holes (BH) solutions which may play the role
of a remnant after the Hawking radiation for such theory are carefully
investigated. The effective Lagrangian for Gross-Neveu-dilaton gravity is also
constructed (in 1/N expansion).
