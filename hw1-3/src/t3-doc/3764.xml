Quantum Mechanics on a Noncommutative Brane in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the quantum mechanics of a particle on a noncommutative
two-sphere with the coordinates obeying an SU(2)-algebra. The momentum operator
can be constructed in terms of an $SU(2)\times SU(2)$-extension and the
Heisenberg algebra recovered in the smooth manifold limit. Similar
considerations apply to the more general SU(n) case.
