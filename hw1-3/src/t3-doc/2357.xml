Scheme-dependence of holographic conformal anomaly in d5 gauged
  supergravity with non-trivial bulk potential
</title>

<abstract>
  Bosonic sector of d5 gauged supergravity with specific parametrization of
full scalar coset is considered (multi-dilaton gravity). Using holographic RG
in the form suggested by de Boer-Verlinde-Verlinde the holographic d4 conformal
anomaly (in the sector of curvature invariants) is found when bulk potential is
not constant. Its comparison with the earlier calculation done in the scheme
where expansion of metric and dilaton over radial coordinate of AdS space is
used demonstrates scheme dependence of holographic conformal anomaly. In
AdS/CFT correspondence where dilatons play role of coupling constants it
coincides with multi-loop conformal anomaly which depends on regularization
scheme in interacting dual QFT. Hence, scheme dependence of holographic
conformal anomaly is consistent with dual QFT expectations.
