<title>
Elliptic Genera of N=2 Hermitian Symmetric Space Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Expressions are given for the elliptic genera of the Kazama-Suzuki models
associated with hermitian symmetric spaces when the problems of field
identifications are absent. We use the models' known Coulomb gas descriptions.
