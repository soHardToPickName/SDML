<title>
Pointlike structure for super p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an efficient method to understand the p-brane dynamics in a
unified framework. For this purpose, we reformulate the action for super
p-branes in the form appropriate to incorporate the pointlike (parton)
structure of higher dimensional p-branes and intend to interpret the p-brane
dynamics as the collective dynamics of superparticles. In order to examine such
a parton picture of super p-branes, we consider various superparticle
configurations that can be reduced from super p-branes, especially, a
supermembrane, and study the partonic structure of classical p-brane solutions.
