<title>
On Integrable Quantum Group Invariant Antiferromagnets
</title>

<abstract>
  A new open spin chain hamiltonian is introduced. It is both integrable
(Sklyanin`s type $K$ matrices are used to achieve this) and invariant under
${\cal U}_{\epsilon}(sl(2))$ transformations in nilpotent irreps for
$\epsilon^3=1$. Some considerations on the centralizer of nilpotent
representations and its representation theory are also presented.
