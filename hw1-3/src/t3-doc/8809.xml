Higher derivative quantum gravity with torsion in the conformally
  Self-Dual Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The path integral for higher-derivative quantum gravity with torsion is
considered. Applying the methods of two-dimensional quantum gravity, this path
integral is analyzed in the limit of conformally self-dual metrics. A scaling
law for fixed-volume geometry is obtained.
