<title>
Topologically massive gauge theories from first order theories in
  arbitrary dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We thereby prove that a large class of topologically massive theories of the
Cremmer-Scherk-Kalb-Ramond-type in any $d$ dimensions corresponds to gauge
non-invariant first-order theories that can be interpreted as self-dual models.
