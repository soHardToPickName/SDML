<title>
On running couplings in gauge theories from type-IIB supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an explicit solution of type-IIB supergravity describing the
strong coupling regime of a non-supersymmetric gauge theory. The latter has a
running coupling with an ultraviolet stable fixed point corresponding to the
N=4 SU(N) super-Yang-Mills theory at large N. The running coupling has a power
law behaviour, argued to be universal, that is consistent with holography.
Around the critical point, our solution defines an asymptotic expansion for the
gauge coupling beta-function. We also calculate the first correction to the
Coulombic quark-antiquark potential.
