Dynamics in a noncommutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the dynamics of a particular two-dimensional (2D) physical system
in the four dimensional (4D) (non-)commutative phase space by exploiting the
consistent Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms based on the symplectic
structures defined on the 4D (non-)commutative cotangent manifolds. The
noncommutativity exists {\it equivalently} in the coordinate or the momentum
planes embedded in the 4D cotangent manifolds. The signature of this
noncommutativity is reflected in the derivation of the first-order Lagrangians
where we exploit the most general form of the Legendre transformation defined
on the (non-)commutative (co-)tangent manifolds. The second-order Lagrangian,
defined on the 4D {\it tangent manifold}, turns out to be the {\it same}
irrespective of the noncommutativity present in the 4D cotangent manifolds for
the discussion of the Hamiltonian formulation. A connection with the
noncommutativity of the dynamics, associated with the quantum groups on the
q-deformed 4D cotangent manifolds, is also pointed out.
