<title>
On the supersymmetric effective action of Matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple derivation of the supersymmetric one-loop effective
action of SU(2) Matrix theory by expressing it in a compact exponential form
whose invariance under supersymmetry transformations is obvious. This result
clarifies the one-loop exactness of the leading v^4 interactions and the
absence of non-perturbative corrections.
