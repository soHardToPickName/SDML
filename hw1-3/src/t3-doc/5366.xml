<title>
Exact Four Dimensional Exploding Universe Solution in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain a four dimensional exploding universe solution in string theory.
The solution is obtained from the string theory in the flat background by using
non-abelian $T$-duality and the analytic continuation. In the solution, the
radius of the universe is finite for fixed time and the universe is surrounded
with the boundary which is composed of the singularity. The boundary runs away
with the speed of light and the flat space-time is left behind.
