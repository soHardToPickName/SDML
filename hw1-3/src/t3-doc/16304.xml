<title>
Algebraic Proof of the Symmetric Space Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  I give a relatively elementary proof of the symmetric space theorem, due to
Goddard, Nahm and Olive \cite{GNO}. Unlike their original proof, which involves
the quark-model construction, I only use elementary algebraic techniques.
