The Life and Times of Emmy Noether; contributions of E. Noether to
  particle physics
</title>

<abstract>
  The contributions of Emmy Noether to particle physics fall into two
categories. One is given under the rubric of Noether's theorem, and the other
may be described as her important contributions to modern mathematics. These
are discussed along with an historical account of her work and what its impact
has been. In addition a brief biography is given. (To be published in the
Proceedings of the Int'l Conf. on The History of Original Ideas and Basic
Discoveries in Particle Physics, Erice, Italy, 29 July - 4 Aug., 1994.)
