Orbifolds of AdS_5xS^5 and 4d Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between the large Nc limit of four dimensional N=2,1,0
conformal field theories and supergravity on orbifolds of AdS_5xS^5. We analyze
the Kaluza-Klein states of the supergravity theory and relate them to the
spectrum of (chiral) primary operators of the (super) conformal field theories.
