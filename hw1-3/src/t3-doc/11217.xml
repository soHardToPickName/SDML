<title>
Consistent noncommutative quantum gauge theories?
</title>

<abstract>
  A new noncommutative model invariant with respect to U(1) gauge group is
proposed. The model is free of nonintegrable infrared singularities. Its
commutative classical limit describes a free scalar field. Generalization to
U(N) models is also considered.
