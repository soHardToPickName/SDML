<title>
Modular Invariance and Uniqueness of Conformal Characters
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the conformal characters of various rational models of
W-algebras can be already uniquely determined if one merely knows the central
charge and the conformal dimensions. As a side result we develop several tools
for studying representations of SL(2,Z) on spaces of modular functions. These
methods, applied here only to certain rational conformal field theories, may be
useful for the analysis of many others.
