<title>
Single-scale diagrams and multiple binomial sums
</title>

<abstract>
  The $\epsilon$-expansion of several two-loop self-energy diagrams with
different thresholds and one mass are calculated. On-shell results are reduced
to multiple binomial sums which values are presented in analytical form.
