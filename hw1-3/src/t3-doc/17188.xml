<title>
Creation of scalar particles in the presence of a constant electric
  field in an anisotropic cosmological universe
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present article we analyze the phenomenon of particle creation in a
cosmological anisotropic universe when a constant electric field is present. We
compute, via the Bogoliubov transformations, the density number of particles
created.
