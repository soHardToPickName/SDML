On the Moduli Spaces of M(atrix)-Theory Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  By identifying the moduli space of coupling constants in the SYM description
of toroidal compactifications of M(atrix)-Theory, we construct the M(atrix)
description of the moduli spaces of Type IIA string theory compactified on T^n.
Addition of theta terms to the M(atrix) SYM produces the shift symmetries
necessary to recover the correct global structure of the moduli spaces. Up to
n=3, the corresponding BPS charges transform under the proper representations
of the U-duality groups. For n=4,5, if we make the ansatz of including the BPS
charges corresponding to the wrapped M-theory 5-brane, the correspondence with
Type IIA continues to hold. However, for n=6, we find additional charges for
which there are no obvious candidates in M(atrix)-Theory.
