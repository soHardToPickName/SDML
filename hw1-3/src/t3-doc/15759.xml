<title>
A One Dimensional Ideal Gas of Spinons, or Some Exact Results on the XXX
  Spin Chain with Long Range Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a few properties of the XXX spin chain with long range
interaction. The plan of these notes is:
 1. The Hamiltonian
 2. Symmetry of the model
 3. The irreducible multiplets
 4. The spectrum
 5. Wave functions and statistics
 6. The spinon description
 7. The thermodynamics
