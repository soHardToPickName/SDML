<title>
Dressing Technique for Intermediate Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalized AKNS systems introduced and discussed recently in \cite{dGHM}
are considered. It was shown that the dressing technique both in matrix
pseudo-differential operators and formal series with respect to the spectral
parameter can be developed for these hierarchies.
