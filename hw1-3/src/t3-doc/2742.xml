Symmetry breaking boundary conditions and WZW orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  Symmetry breaking boundary conditions for WZW theories are discussed. We
derive explicit formulae for the reflection coefficients in the presence of
boundary conditions that preserve only an orbifold subalgebra with respect to
an involutive automorphism of the chiral algebra. The characters and modular
transformations of the corresponding orbifold theories are computed. Both inner
and outer automorphisms are treated.
