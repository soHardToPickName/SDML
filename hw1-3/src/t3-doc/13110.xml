<title>
The effective action of (2+1)-dimensional QED: the effect of finite
  fermion density
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action of (2+1)-dimensional QED with finite fermion density is
calculated in a uniform electromagnetic field. It is shown that the integer
quantum Hall effect and de Haas-van Alphen like phenomena in condensed matter
physics are derived directly from the effective action.
