Instanton effects and Witten complex in supersymmetric quantum mechanics
  on SO(4)
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine supersymmetric quantum mechanics on $SO(4)$ to realize Witten's
idea. We find instanton solutions connecting approximate vacuums. We calculate
Hessian matrices for these solutions to determine true vacuums. Our result is
in agreement with de Rham cohomology of $SO(4)$. We also give a criterion for
cancellation of instanton effects for a pair of instanton paths.
