<title>
A New Class of Integrable Models of 1+1 Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
  Coupled to Scalar Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  Integrable models of 1+1 dimensional gravity coupled to scalar and vector
fields are briefly reviewed. A new class of integrable models with nonminimal
coupling to scalar fields is constructed and discussed.
