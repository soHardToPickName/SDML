<title>
Black Hole Entropy, Special Geometry and Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  We review work done over the last years on the macroscopic and microscopic
entropy of supersymmetric black holes in fourdimensional N=2 supergravity and
in N=2 compactifications of string theory and M-theory. Particular emphasis is
put on the crucial role of higher curvature terms and of modifications of the
area law in obtaining agreement between the macroscopic entropy, which is a
geometric property of black hole solutions and the microscopic entropy, which
is computed by state counting in Calabi-Yau compactifications of string or
M-theory. We also discuss invariance properties of the entropy under stringy
T-duality and S-duality transformations in N=2,4 compactifications in presence
of higher curvature terms.
  In order to make the paper self-contained we review the laws of black hole
mechanics in higher derivative gravity, the definition of entropy as a surface
charge, the superconformal off-shell description of N=2 supergravity, special
geometry, and N=2 compactifications of heterotic and type II string theory and
of M-theory.
