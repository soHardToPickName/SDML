Deforming Einstein's Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  A deformation of Einstein Gravity is constructed based on gauging the
noncommutative ISO(3,1) group using the Seiberg-Witten map. The transformation
of the star product under diffeomorphism is given, and the action is determined
to second order in the deformation parameter.
