<title>
Stability Equation and Two-Component Eigenmode for Domain Walls in a
  Scalar Potential Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics involving two-component eigenfunctions is
applied to the stability equation associated with two classical configurations.
The issue of stability is studied by introducing an operator technique for the
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) on two domain walls in a scalar potential
model with minimal $N=1-$supersymmetry.
