Holography and Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study holography for asymptotically AdS spaces with an arbitrary genus
compact Riemann surface as the conformal boundary. Such spaces can be
constructed from the Euclidean AdS_3 by discrete identifications; the discrete
groups one uses are the so-called classical Schottky groups. As we show, the
spaces so constructed have an appealing interpretation of ``analytic
continuations'' of the known Lorentzian signature black hole solutions; it is
one of the motivations for our generalization of the holography to this case.
We use the semi-classical approximation to the gravity path integral, and
calculate the gravitational action for each space, which is given by the
(appropriately regularized) volume of the space. As we show, the regularized
volume reproduces exactly the action of Liouville theory, as defined on
arbitrary Riemann surfaces by Takhtajan and Zograf. Using the results as to the
properties of this action, we discuss thermodynamics of the spaces and analyze
the boundary CFT partition function. Some aspects of our construction, such as
the thermodynamical interpretation of the Teichmuller (Schottky) spaces, may be
of interest for mathematicians working on Teichmuller theory.
