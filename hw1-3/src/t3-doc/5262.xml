<title>
Quantum-mechanical tunnelling and the renormalization group
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the applicability of the exact renormalization group to the study
of tunnelling phenomena. We investigate quantum-mechanical systems whose energy
eigenstates are affected significantly by tunnelling through a barrier in the
potential. Within the approximation of the derivative expansion, we find that
the exact renormalization group predicts the correct qualitative behaviour for
the lowest energy eigenvalues. However, quantitative accuracy is achieved only
for potentials with small barriers. For large barriers, the use of alternative
methods, such as saddle-point expansions, can provide quantitative accuracy.
