Lectures on Two-Dimensional Noncommutative Gauge Theory 1. Classical
  Aspects
</title>

<abstract>
  These notes comprise the first of two articles devoted to the construction of
exact solutions of noncommutative gauge theory in two spacetime dimensions.
This first part deals solely with the classical theory on a noncommutative
torus. Topics covered include a mathematical introduction to the geometry of
the noncommutative torus, the definition, properties and symmetries of
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory, and the complete solution of the classical
field equations.
