Non-Abelian Born-Infeld versus String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the results of Hashimoto and Taylor, we perform a detailed study
of the mass spectrum of the non-abelian Born-Infeld theory, defined by the
symmetrized trace prescription, on tori with constant magnetic fields turned
on. Subsequently, we compare this for several cases to the mass spectrum of
intersecting D-branes. Exact agreement is found in only two cases: BPS
configurations on the four-torus and coinciding tilted branes. Finally we
investigate the fluctuation dynamics of an arbitrarily wrapped Dp-brane with
flux.
