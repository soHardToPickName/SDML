ADM, Bondi mass, and energy conservation in two-dimensional dilaton
  gravities
</title>

<abstract>
We show how a stress-energy pseudotensor can be constructed in two-dimensional
dilatonic gravity theories (classical, CGHS and RST) and derive the expression
for the ADM mass in these theories from it. We define the Bondi mass for these
theories by using the pseudotensor formalism. The resulting expression is the
generalization of the expression for the ADM mass. The boundary condition
needed for the energy conservation is also investigated. It is shown that under
appropriate boundary conditions, our definition of the Bondi mass is exactly
the ADM mass minus the matter radiation energy at null infinity.
