<title>
Sphaleron of a 4 dimensional SO(4) Higgs model
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the finite energy path between topologically distinct vacua of a
4 dimensional SO(4) Higgs model which is known to support an instanton, and
show that there is a sphaleron with Chern-Simons number N_CS=1/2 at the top of
the energy barrier. This is carried out using the original geometric loop
construction of Manton.
