N=2 Superintegrable f-Toda Mapping and Super-NLS Hierarchy in the (1|2)
  Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  A new integrable N=2 supersymmetric f-Toda mapping in (1|2) superspace,
acting like the symmetry transformation of N=2 supersymmetric NLS hierarchy, is
proposed. The first two Hamiltonian structures and the recursion operator
connecting all evolution systems and Hamiltonian structures of the N=2
super-NLS hierarchy are constructed in explicit form using only invariance
conditions with respect to the f-Toda mapping. A new representation for its
Hamiltonians is observed.
