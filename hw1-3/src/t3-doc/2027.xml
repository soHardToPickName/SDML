N=1, D=10 Tensionless Superbranes II
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a model for tensionless (null) p-branes with N=1 global
supersymmetry in 10-dimensional Minkowski space-time. We give an action for the
model and show that it is reparametrization and kappa-invariant. We also find
some solutions of the classical equations of motion. In the case of null
superstring (p=1), we obtain the general solution in arbitrary gauge.
