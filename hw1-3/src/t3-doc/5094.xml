Affine Lie Algebras, String Junctions and 7-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the realization of affine ADE Lie algebras as string junctions on
mutually non-local 7-branes in Type IIB string theory. The existence of the
affine algebra is signaled by the presence of the imaginary root junction
``delta'', which is realized as a string encircling the 7-brane configuration.
The level k of an affine representation partially constrains the asymptotic
(p,q) charges of string junctions departing the configuration. The junction
intersection form reproduces the full affine inner product, plus terms in the
asymptotic charges.
