Continuum Limit of Spin-1 Chain (the only change is added references)
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the continuum limit of the spin-1 chain in the non-Abelian
bosonization approach of Affleck and show that the Hamiltonian of integrable
spin-1 chain yields the Lagrangian of supersymmetric sine-Gordon model in the
zero lattice spacing limit. We also show that the quantum group generators of
the spin-1 chain give non-local charges of the supersymmetric sine-Gordon
theory.
