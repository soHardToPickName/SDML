<title>
Heterotic and type I strings from twisted supermembranes
</title>

<abstract>
  As shown by Ho\v{r}ava and Witten, there are gravitational anomalies at the
boundaries of $M^{10}\times S^1/Z_2$ of 11 dimensional supergravity. They
showed that only 10 dimensional vector multiplets belonging to $E_8$ gauge
group can be consistently coupled to this theory. Thus, the dimensional
reduction of this theory should be the low energy limit of the $E_8\times E_8$
heterotic string. Here we assume that M-theory is a theory of supermembranes
which includes twisted supermembranes. We show that for a target space
$M^{10}\times S^1/Z_2$, in the limit in which $S^1/Z_2$ is small, the effective
action is the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string. We also consider supermembranes
on $M^{9}\times S^1\times S^1/Z_2$ and find the dualities expected from 11
dimensional supergravity on this manifold. We show that the requirements for
worldsheet anomaly cancellations at the boundaries of the worldvolume action
are the same requirements imposed on the Ho\v{r}ava-Witten action.
