<title>
The Theory of Turbulence in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The methods of conformal field theory are used to obtain the series of exact
solutions of the fundamental equations of the theory of turbulence. The basic
conjecture, proved to be self-consistent ,is the conformal invariance of the
inertial range. The resulting physical picture is different from the standard
one , since the enstrophy transfer is catalyzed by the large scale motions. The
theory gives some unambiguous predictions for the correlations in the inertial
range.
