<title>
Path integral treatment of two- and three-dimensional delta-function
  potentials and application to spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm problem
</title>

<abstract>
  Delta-function potentials in two- and three-dimensional quantum mechanics are
analyzed by the incorporation of the self-adjoint extension method to the path
integral formalism. The energy-dependent Green functions for free particle plus
delta-function potential systems are explicitly calculated. Also the
energy-dependent Green function for the spin-1/2 Aharonov-Bohm problem is
evaluated. It is found that the only one special value of the self-adjoint
extension parameter gives a well-defined and non-trivial time-dependent
propagator. This special value corresponds to the viewpoint of the spin-1/2
Aharonov-Bohm problem when the delta-function is treated as a limit of the
infinitesimal radius.
