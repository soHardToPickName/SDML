Calibrations and Fayyazuddin-Smith Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a class of spacetimes introduced by Fayyazuddin and Smith to
describe intersecting M5-branes admit a generalized Kahler calibration.
Equipped with this understanding, we are able to construct spacetimes
corresponding to further classes of calibrated $p$-brane world-volume solitons.
We note that these classes of spacetimes also describe the fields of $p$-branes
wrapping certain supersymmetric cycles of Calabi-Yau manifolds.
