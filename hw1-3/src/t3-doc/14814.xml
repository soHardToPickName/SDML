<title>
M(atrix)-Theory in Various Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate the precise numerical correspondence between long range
scattering of supergravitons and membranes in supergravity in the infinite
momentum frame and in M(atrix)-Theory, both in 11 dimensions and for toroidal
compactifications. We also identify wrapped membranes in terms of topological
invariants of the vector bundles associated to the field theory description of
compactified M(atrix)-Theory. We use these results to check the realization of
T-duality in M(atrix)-Theory.
