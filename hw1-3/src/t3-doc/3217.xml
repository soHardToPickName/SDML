R^4 Couplings in M and Type II Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss several implications of R^4 couplings in M theory when
compactified on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds. In particular, these couplings can
be predicted by supersymmetry from the mixed gauge-gravitational Chern-Simons
couplings in five dimensions and are related to the one-loop holomorphic
anomaly in four-dimensional N=2 theories. We find a new contribution to the
Einstein term in five dimensions proportional to the Euler number of the
internal CY threefold, which corresponds to a one-loop correction of the
hypermultiplet geometry. This correction is reproduced by a direct computation
in type II string theories. Finally, we discuss a universal non-perturbative
correction to the type IIB hyper-metric.
