<title>
The Symmetric Space and Homogeneous sine-Gordon Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Two series of integrable theories are constructed which have soliton
solutions and can be thought of as generalizations of the sine-Gordon theory.
They exhibit internal symmetries and can be described as gauged WZW theories
with a potential term. The spectrum of massive states is determined.
