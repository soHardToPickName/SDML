Quantum Mechanical Spectra of Charged Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been argued by several authors, using different formalisms, that the
quantum mechanical spectrum of black hole horizon area is discrete and
uniformly spaced. Recently it was shown that two such approaches, namely the
one involving quantisation on a reduced phase space, and the algebraic approach
of Bekenstein and Gour are equivalent for spherically symmetric, neutral black
holes (hep-th/0202076). The observables of one can be mapped to those of the
other. Here we extend that analysis to include charged black holes. Once again,
we find that the ground state of the black hole is a Planck size remnant.
