<title>
Yang-Mills and Born-Infeld actions on finite group spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  Discretized nonabelian gauge theories living on finite group spaces G are
defined by means of a geometric action \int Tr F\wedge *F . This technique is
extended to obtain a discrete version of the Born-Infeld action.
