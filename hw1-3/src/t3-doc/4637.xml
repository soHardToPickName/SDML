<title>
Partition function for general multi-level systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a unified approach to calculating the partition functions of a
general multi-level system with a free Hamiltonian. Particularly, we present
new results for parastatistical systems of any order in the second quantized
approach. Anyonic- like systems are briefly discussed.
