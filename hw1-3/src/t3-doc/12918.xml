<title>
Open inflation without anthropic principle
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose the mechanism of quantum creation of the open Universe in the
observable range of values of $\Omega$. This mechanism is based on the
no-boundary quantum state with the Hawking-Turok instanton in the model with
nonminimally coupled inflaton field and does not use any anthropic
considerations. Rather, the probability distribution peak with necessary
parameters of the inflation stage is generated on this instanton due to quantum
loop effects. In contrast with a similar mechanism for closed models, existing
only for the tunneling quantum state of the Universe, open inflation originates
from the no-boundary cosmological wavefunction.
