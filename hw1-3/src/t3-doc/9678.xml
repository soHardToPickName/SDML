Summing Over World-Sheet Boundaries
</title>

<abstract>
  The moduli associated with boundaries in a Riemann surface are parametrized
by the positions and strengths of electric charges. This suggests a method for
summing over orientable Riemann surfaces with Dirichlet boundary conditions on
the embedding coordinates. A light-cone parameterization of such boundaries is
also discussed.
