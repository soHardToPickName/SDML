<title>
The massive spinning particle revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a formulation of the massive spinning particle in terms of
physical bosonic and fermionic fields only. We make use neither of auxiliary
objects of the type of $\gamma_5$ nor of gauge fields. The model is to be used
as a suitable starting point for a forthcoming study of the rigid
superparticle.
