A Relation Between Gravity in $(3+1)$--Dimensions and Pontrjagin
  Topological Invariant
</title>

<abstract>
  A relation between the MacDowell-Mansouri theory of gravity and the
Pontrjagin toplogical invariant in $(3+1)$ dimensions is discussed. This
relation may be of especial interest in the quest of finding a mechanism to go
from non-dynamical to dynamical gravity.
