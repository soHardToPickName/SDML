Type-II Superstrings and New Spacetime Superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a geometric formulation of type-IIA and -IIB superstring theories
in which the Wess-Zumino term is second order in the supersymmetric currents.
The currents are constructed using supergroup manifolds corresponding to
superalgebras: the IIA superalgebra derived from M-algebra and the IIB
superalgebra obtained by a T-duality transformation of the IIA superalgebra. We
find that a slight modification of the IIB superalgebra is needed to describe
D-string theories, in which the U(1) gauge field on the worldsheet is
explicitly constructed in terms of D-string charges. A unification of the
superalgebras in a (10+1)-dimensional N=2 superalgebra is discussed too.
