<title>
D-branes from M-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The 2-brane and 4-brane solutions of ten dimensional IIA supergravity have a
dual interpretation as Dirichlet-branes, or `D-branes', of type IIA superstring
theory and as `M-branes' of an $S^1$-compactified eleven dimensional
supermembrane theory, or M-theory. This eleven-dimensional connection is used
to determine the ten-dimensional Lorentz covariant worldvolume action for the
Dirichlet super 2-brane, and its coupling to background spacetime fields. It is
further used to show that the 2-brane can carry the Ramond-Ramond charge of the
Dirichlet 0-brane as a topological charge, and an interpretation of the 2-brane
as a 0-brane condensate is suggested. Similar results are found for the
Dirichlet 4-brane via its interpretation as a double-dimensional reduction of
the eleven-dimensional fivebrane. It is suggested that the latter be
interpreted as a D-brane of an open eleven-dimensional supermembrane.
