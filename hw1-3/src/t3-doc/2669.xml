Attractive Forces Between Electrons in QED$_{3}$
</title>

<abstract>
  Vacuum polarization effects are non-perturbatively incorporated into the
photon propagator to eliminate the severe infrared problems characteristic of
QED$_3$. The theory is thus rephrased in terms of a massive vector boson whose
mass is $e^2/(8\pi)$. Subsequently, it is shown that electron-electron bound
states are possible in QED$_3$.
