Multigraviton Scattering in the Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider scattering processes in the matrix model with three incoming and
three outgoing gravitons. We find a discrepancy between the amplitude
calculated from the matrix model and the supergravity prediction. Possible
sources for this discrepancy are discussed.
