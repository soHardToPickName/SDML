Vacuum curves, classical integrable systems in discrete space-time and
  statistical physics
</title>

<abstract>
  A dynamical system with discrete time is studied by means of algebraic
geometry. The system admits a reduction that is interpreted as a classical
field theory in 2+1-dimensional wholly discrete space-time. The integrals of
motion of a particular case of the reduced system are shown to coincide, in
essence, with the statistical sum of the well-known (inhomogeneous)
2-dimensional dimer model (the statistical sum is here a function of two
parameters). Possible generalizations of the system are examined.
