<title>
Non-Abelian Anomalies and Effective Actions for a Homogeneous Space
  $G/H$
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the problem of constructing the fully gauged effective action in
$2n$-dimensional space-time for Nambu-Goldstone bosons valued in a homogeneous
space $G/H$, with the requirement that the action be a solution of the
anomalous Ward identity and be invariant under the gauge transformations of
$H$. We show that this can be done whenever the homotopy group $\pi_{2n}(G/H)$
is trivial, $G/H$ is reductive and $H$ is embedded in $G$ so as to be anomaly
free, in particular if $H$ is an anomaly safe group. We construct the necessary
generalization of the Bardeen counterterm and give explicit forms for the
anomaly and the effective action. When $G/H$ is a symmetric space the
counterterm and the anomaly decompose into a parity even and a parity odd part.
In this case, for the parity even part of the action, one does not need the
anomaly free embedding of $H$.
