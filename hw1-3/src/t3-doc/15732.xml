Operator Formulation of q-Deformed Dual String Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an operator formulation of the q-deformed dual string model
amplitude using an infinite set of q-harmonic oscillators. The formalism
attains the crossing symmetry and factorization and allows to express the
general n-point function as a factorized product of vertices and propagators.
