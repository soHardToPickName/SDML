A Study of Brane Solutions in D-dimensional Coupled Gravity System
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, we use only the equation of motion for an interacting system
of gravity, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor to study the soliton solutions by
making use of a Poincar\'e invariant ansatz. We show that the system of
equations are completly integrable and the solution is unique with appropriate
boundary conditions. Some new class of solutions are also given explicitly.
