Addendum to ``Integrability of Open Spin Chains with Quantum Algebra
  Symmetry''
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the quantum-algebra-invariant open spin chains associated with
the affine Lie algebras $A^{(1)}_n$ for $n>1$ are integrable. The argument,
which applies to a large class of other quantum-algebra-invariant chains, does
not require that the corresponding $R$ matrix have crossing symmetry.
