<title>
Possible Resolution of Black Hole Singularities from Large N Gauge
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that the recent conjecture relating large N gauge theories to
string theory in anti-de Sitter spaces offers a resolution in principle of many
problems in black hole physics. This is because the gauge theory also describes
spacetimes which are not anti-de Sitter, and include black hole horizons and
curvature singularities.
