$N=\half$ Superstring in Zero Dimension and the Spontaneous Breakdown of
  the Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose random matrix models which have $N=\half$ supersymmetry in zero
dimension. The supersymmetry breaks down spontaneously. It is shown that the
double scaling limit can be defined in these models and the breakdown of the
supersymmetry remains in the continuum limit. The exact non-trivial partition
functions of the string theories corresponding to these matrix models are also
obtained.
