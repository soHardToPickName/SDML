N=1 and N=2 Geometry from Fluxes
</title>

<abstract>
  We provide a proof of the equivalence of N=1 dynamics obtained by deforming
N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories by addition of certain superpotential terms,
with that of type IIB superstring on Calabi-Yau threefold geometries with
fluxes. In particular we show that minimization of the superpotential involving
gaugino fields is equivalent to finding loci where Seiberg-Witten curve has
certain factorization property. Moreover, by considering the limit of turning
off of the superpotential we obtain the full low energy dynamics of N=2 gauge
systems from Calabi-Yau geometries with fluxes.
