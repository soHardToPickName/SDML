<title>
Generic solutions for some integrable lattice equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the expressions for $\psi$-functions and generic solutions of
lattice principal chiral equations, lattice KP hierarchy and hierarchy
including lattice N-wave type equations. $\tau$-function of $n$ free fermions
plays fundamental role in this context. Miwa's coordinates in our case appear
as the lattice parameters.
