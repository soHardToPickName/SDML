Quantum Soliton Mass Corrections in SL(N) Affine Toda Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The first quantum mass corrections for the solitons of complex $sl(n)$ affine
Toda field theory are calculated. The corrections are real and preserve the
classical mass ratios. The formalism also proves that the solitons are
classically stable.
