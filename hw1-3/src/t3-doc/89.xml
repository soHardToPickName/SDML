<title>
On the theory of coherent pair production in crystals in presence of
  acoustic waves
</title>

<abstract>
  The influence of hypersonic waves excited in a single crystal is investigated
on the process of electron-positron pair creation by high-energy photons. The
coherent part of the corresponding differential cross-section is derived as a
function of the amplitude and wave number of the hypersound. The values of the
parameters are specified for which the latter affects remarkably on the pair
creation cross-section. It is shown that under certain conditions the presence
of hypersonic waves can result in enhancement of the process cross-section.
