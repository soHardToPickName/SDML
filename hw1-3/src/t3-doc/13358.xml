<title>
R^4 terms in 11 dimensions and conformal anomaly of (2,0) theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Using AdS_7/CFT_6 correspondence we discuss computation of a subleading O(N)
term in the scale anomaly of (2,0) theory describing N coincident M5 branes.
While the leading O(N^3) contribution to the anomaly is determined by the
supergravity action, the O(N) contribution comes from a particular R^4 term (8d
Euler density) in the 11-dimensional effective action. This R^4 term is argued
to be part of the same superinvariant as the P-odd C_3 R^4 term known to
produce O(N) contribution to the R-symmetry anomaly of (2,0) theory. The known
results for R-anomaly suggest that the total scale anomaly extrapolated to N=1
should be the same as the anomaly of a single free (2,0) tensor multiplet. A
proposed explanation of this agreement is that the coefficient 4N^3 in the
anomaly (which was found previously to be also the ratio of the 2-point and
3-point graviton correlators in the (2,0) theory and in the free tensor
multiplet theory) is shifted to 4N^3 -3N.
