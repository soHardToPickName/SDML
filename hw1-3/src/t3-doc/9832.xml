An infinite number of potentials surrounding 2d black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We found an infinite number of potentials surrounding 2d black hole.
According to the transmission ${\cal T}$ and reflection ${\cal R}$ coefficients
for scattering of string fields off 2d black hole, we can classify an infinite
number of potentials into three : graviton-dilaton, tachyon and the other
types. We suggest that the discrete states from all the Virasoro levels be
candidates for new potentials (modes).
