SL(2,Z) tensionless string backgrounds in IIB string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine a tensionless limit of a SL(2,Z) set of background solutions to
IIB supergravity theory, obtained by performing an infinite boost. This yields
a solution that corresponds to taking the original string tension to zero. The
limit reproduces ordinary Minkowski space except for a delta-like singularity
along the string. We study the field content and the energy momentum tensor.
