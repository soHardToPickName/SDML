<title>
Weyl Anomalies of Strings in Temporal Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider two-dimensional quantum gravity coupled to matter in the
temporal gauge, using the Polyakov path integral. We show that the integration
over the metric can be explicitly performed under some plausible assumptions.
We also discuss that the critical dimensions in string theory may not be
determined in the temporal gauge.
