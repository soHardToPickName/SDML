<title>
Quantum double of Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, its universal R-matrix and
  their representations
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper a new quasi-triangular Hopf algebra as the quantum double of
the Heisenberg-Weyl algebra is presented.Its universal R-matrix is built and
the corresponding representation theory are studied with the explict
construction for the representations of this quantum double. \newpage
