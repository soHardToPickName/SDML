<title>
The effect of a topological gauge field on Bose-Einstein condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that Bose-Einstein condensation of charged scalar fields interacting
with a topological gauge field at finite temperature is inhibited except for
special values of the topological field. We also show that fermions interacting
with this topological gauge field can condense for some values of the gauge
field.
