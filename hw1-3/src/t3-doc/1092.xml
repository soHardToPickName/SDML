<title>
On the Absence of Cross-Confinement for Dynamically Generated
  Multi-Chern-Simons Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that when the induced parity breaking part of the effective action
for the low-momentum region of U(1) x ... x U(1) Maxwell gauge field theory
with massive fermions in 3 dimensions is coupled to a \phi^4 scalar field
theory, it is not possible to eliminate the screening of the long-range Coulomb
interactions and get external charges confined in the broken Higgs phase. This
result is valid for non-zero temperature as well.
