Entropy, Quantum Decoherence and Pointer States in Scalar ``Parton''
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Entropy arises in strong interactions by a dynamical separation of
``partons'' from unobservable ``environment'' modes due to confinement. For
interacting scalar fields we calculate the statistical entropy of the
observable subsystem. Diagonalizing its functional density matrix yields field
pointer states and their probabilities in terms of Wightman functions. It also
indicates how to calculate a finite geometric entropy proportional to a surface
area.
