Chern-Simons Forms, Mickelsson-Faddeev Algebras and the P-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In string theory, nilpotence of the BRS operator $\d$ for the string
functional relates the Chern-Simons term in the gauge-invariant antisymmetric
tensor field strength to the central term in the Kac-Moody algebra. We
generalize these ideas to p-branes with odd p and find that the Kac-Moody
algebra for the string becomes the Mickelsson-Faddeev algebra for the p-brane.
