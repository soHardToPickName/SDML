A Family of N=2 Gauge Theories with Exact S-Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an infinite family of N=2 $Sp(2n)$ gauge theories that naturally
arise from the D3-brane probe dynamics in F-theory. The matter sector consists
of four fundamental and one antisymmetric tensor hyper multiplets. We propose
that, in the limit of vanishing bare masses, the theory has exact
$SO(8)\sdtimes SL(2,Z)$ duality. We examine the semiclassical BPS spectrum in
the Coulomb phase by quantizing various monopole moduli space dynamics, and
show that it is indeed consistent with the exact S-duality.
