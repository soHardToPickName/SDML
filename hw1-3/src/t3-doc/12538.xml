Recent Progress of the Liouville Approach to 2D Gravity and its Toda (W)
  Generalizations
</title>

<abstract>
  These lecture notes review current progress on the class of conformal
theories which may be studied by quantizing the conformal Toda dynamics. After
summarizing recent developments in undertanding the quantum group structure of
the Liouville theory, one recalls how classically, two-dimensional black holes
come out from the non-abelian Toda systems, and reviews the geometrical
interpretation of the classical $A_n$-Toda theories, just put forward, that
relates W-geometries with the external geometries of holomorphic surfaces in
complex projective spaces.
