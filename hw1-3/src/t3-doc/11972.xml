<title>
Matrix Cartan superdomains, super Toeplitz operators, and quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general theory of non-perturbative quantization of a class of
hermitian symmetric supermanifolds. The quantization scheme is based on the
notion of a super Toeplitz operator on a suitable Z_2 -graded Hilbert space of
superholomorphic functions. The quantized supermanifold arises as the C^*
-algebra generated by all such operators. We prove that our quantization
framework reproduces the invariant super Poisson structure on the classical
supermanifold as Planck's constant tends to zero.
