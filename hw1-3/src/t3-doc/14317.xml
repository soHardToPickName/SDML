<title>
Construction of non-Abelian gauge theories on noncommutative spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a formalism to explicitly construct non-Abelian gauge theories on
noncommutative spaces (induced via a star product with aconstant Poisson
tensor) from a consistency relation. This results in an expansion of the gauge
parameter, the noncommutative gauge potential and fields in the fundamental
representation, in powers of a parameter of the noncommutativity. This allows
the explicit construction of actions for these gauge theories.
