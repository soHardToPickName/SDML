<title>
Orbifolds, Penrose Limits and Supersymmetry Enhancement
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider supersymmetric PP-wave limits for different N=1 orbifold
geometries of the five sphere S^5 and the five dimensional Einstein manifold
T^{1,1}. As there are several interesting ways to take the Penrose limits, the
PP-wave geometry can be either maximal supersymmetric N=4 or half-maximal
supersymmetric N=2. We discuss in detail the cases AdS_5 x S^5/Z_3, AdS_5 x
S^5/(Z_m x Z_n) and AdS_5 x T^{1,1}/(\Z_m \times \Z_n) and we identify the
gauge invariant operators which correspond to stringy excitations for the
different limits.
