Gauge Independent Critical Exponents for QED Coupled to a Four Fermi
  Interaction with and without a Chern Simons Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the self consistency method for determining critical exponents to a
model with a four fermi interaction coupled to QED and compute various gauge
independent exponents in arbitrary dimensions in the large $N$ expansion at
$O(1/N)$. The formalism is developed to include a Chern Simons term in three
dimensions and the effect such a term has on the exponents is deduced.
