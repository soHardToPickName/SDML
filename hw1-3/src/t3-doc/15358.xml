<title>
A non-singular potential for the Dirac monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new vector potential for the Abelian magnetic monopole. The
potential is non-singular in the entire region around the monopole. We argue
how the Dirac quantization condition can be derived for any choice of
potential.
