<title>
Noncommutative gerbes and deformation quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We define noncommutative gerbes using the language of star products.
Quantized twisted Poisson structures are discussed as an explicit realization
in the sense of deformation quantization. Our motivation is the noncommutative
description of D-branes in the presence of topologically non-trivial background
fields.
