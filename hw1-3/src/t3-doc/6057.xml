<title>
The gauge invariant lagrangian for Seiberg-Witten topological monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  A topological gauge invariant lagrangian for Seiberg-Witten monopole
equations is constructed. The action is invariant under a huge class of gauge
transformations which after BRST fixing leads to the BRST invariant action
associated to Seiberg-Witten monopole topological theory. The supersymmetric
transformation of the fields involved in the construction is obtained from the
nilpotent BRST algebra.
