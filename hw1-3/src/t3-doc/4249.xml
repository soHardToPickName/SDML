<title>
Canonical Quantization of Non-Einsteinian Gravity and the Problem of
  Time
</title>

<abstract>
  For a 1+1 dimensional theory of gravity with torsion different approaches to
the formulation of a quantum theory are presented. They are shown to lead to
the same finite dimensional quantum system. Conceptual questions of quantum
gravity like e.g.\ the problem of time are discussed in this framework.
