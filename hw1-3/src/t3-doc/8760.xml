Dilatonic Supergravity in Two Dimensions and the Disappearance of
  Quantum Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze a supergravity theory coupled to a dilaton and superconformal
matters in two dimensions. This theory is classically soluble and we find all
the solutions appeared in Callan, Giddings, Harvey and Strominger's dilatonic
gravity also satisfy the constraints and the equations of motion in this
supersymmetric theory. We quantize this theory by following the procedure of
Distler, Hlousek and Kawai. In the quantum action, the cosmological term is
renormalized to vanish. As a result, any solution corresponding to classical
black hole does not appear in the quantum theory, which should be compared with
the non-supersymmetric case.
