<title>
Supersymmetric Reflection Matrices
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review the general structure of integrable particle theories in
1+1 dimensions having N=1 supersymmetry. Examples are specific perturbed
superconformal field theories (of Yang-Lee type) and the N=1 supersymmetric
sine-Gordon theory. We comment on the modifications that are required when the
N=1 supersymmetry algebra contains non-trivial topological charges.
