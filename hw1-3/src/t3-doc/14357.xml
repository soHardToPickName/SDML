Asymptotic expansion coefficients of the heat kernel in Riemann-Cartan
  space
</title>

<abstract>
  By applying the covariant Taylor expansion method, the fifth lower
coefficients the asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel associated with a
fermion of spin 1/2 in Riemann-Cartan space are manifestly given. These
coefficients in Riemann-Cartan space is derived from those obtained in
Riemannian space by simple replacements.
