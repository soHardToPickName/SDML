<title>
Hausdorff dimension and anyonic distribution functions
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the distribution functions for anyonic excitations classified into
equivalence classes labeled by Hausdorff dimension, $h$ and as an example of
such anyonic systems, we consider the collective excitations of the Fractional
Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE).
