Minimal Spinning String
</title>

<abstract>
  Minimal N=1/2 supersymmetric extension of bosonic Polyakov's string is
constructed. This model is natural generalization of Di Vecchia-Ravndal
superparticle. The classical sector of the model is investigated, Noether
currents and Virosoro supercondition are found. Minimal spinning string is more
simple, than the standard N=1 spinning string of Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond and has a
number of unusial properties such as a chiral symmetry, parabolic type of
equations of movement, non-triviality fermionic sectors for closed strings only
and e.t.c.
