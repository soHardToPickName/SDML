<title>
On Path Dependent State Space for the Proca Field
</title>

<abstract>
  A gauge formulation for the Proca model quantum theory in an open path
functional space representation is revisited. The path dependent vacuum state
is obtained. Starting from this one, other excited states can be obtained too.
Additionally, the functional integration measure needed to define an internal
product in the state space is constructed.
