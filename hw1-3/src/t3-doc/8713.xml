Non linear $\sigma$ models : renormalisability versus geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  After some recalls on the standard (non)-linear $\sigma$ model, we discuss
the interest of B.R.S. symmetry in non-linear $\sigma$ models renormalisation.
We also emphasise the importance of a correct definition of a theory through
physical constraints rather than as given by a particular Lagrangian and
discuss some ways to enlarge the notion of renormalisability.
