On D-Branes and Black Holes in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We find extremal four dimensional black holes with finite area constructed
entirely from intersecting D-branes. We argue that the microscopic degeneracy
of these configurations agrees with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. The
absence of solitonic objects in these configurations may make them useful for
dynamical studies of black holes.
