Quantum Braided Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  A new type of algebras that represent a generalization of both quantum groups
and braided groups is defined. These algebras are given by a pair of solutions
of the Yang--Baxter equation that satisfy some additional conditions. Several
examples are presented.
