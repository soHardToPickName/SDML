<title>
Matrix Models, Open Strings and Quantization of Membranes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an approach to membrane quantization using matrix quantum
mechanics at large N. We show that this leads (through a simple field theory of
two-dimensional open strings and the associated SU(\infty) current algebra) to
a 4-D dynamics of self-dual gravity plus matter.
