<title>
String cosmology versus standard and inflationary cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  This paper presents a review of the basic, model-independent differences
between the pre-big bang scenario, arising naturally in a string cosmology
context, and the standard inflationary scenario. We use an unconventional
approach in which the introduction of technical details is avoided as much as
possible, trying to focus the reader's attention on the main conceptual aspects
of both scenarios. The aim of the paper is not to conclude in favour either of
one or of the other scenario, but to raise questions that are left to the
reader's meditation. Warnings: the paper does not contain equations, and is not
intended as a complete review of all aspects of string cosmology.
