<title>
An action for the super-5-brane in D=11 supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  An alternative path is taken for deriving an action for the supersymmetric
5-brane in 11 dimensions. Selfduality does not follow from the action, but is
consistent with the equations of motion for arbitrary supergravity backgrounds.
The action involves a 2-form as well as a 5-form world-volume potential;
inclusion of the latter makes the action, as well as the non-linear selfduality
relation for the 3-form field strength, polynomial. The requirement of
invariance under kappa-transformations determines the form of the selfduality
relation, as well as the action. The formulation is shown to be equivalent to
earlier formulations of 5-brane dynamics.
