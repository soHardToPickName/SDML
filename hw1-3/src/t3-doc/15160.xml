Type I D-particle and its Interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  In a previous paper (hep-th/9808141) we showed that the type I string theory
contains a stable non-BPS D-particle carrying SO(32) spinor charge. In this
paper we formulate the rules for computing the spectrum and interaction of open
strings with one or both ends lying on this D-particle.
