<title>
Integrability as Effective Principle of Nonperturbative Field and String
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  One of the perspectives in modern quantum field and string theory is related
with the attempts to go beyond the perturbation theory. It turns out that a key
principle in the formulation of all known non-perturbative results is {\it
integrability}, i.e. arising of the structures of completely integrable
systems. I discuss several important steps in this direction and speculate on
its further possible development.
