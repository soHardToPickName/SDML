<title>
Color Reflection Invariance and Monopole Condensation in QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum instability of the Savvidy-Nielsen-Olesen (SNO) vacuum of the
one-loop effective action of SU(2) QCD is due to the lack of gauge invariance.
We prove that the gauge invariance, in particular the color reflection
invariance, restores the stability of the SNO vacuum, and thus guarantees the
stability of the magnetic condensation in QCD.
