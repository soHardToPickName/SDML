Gauge Theory Scattering from the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to study near forward scattering of
colourless objects in gauge theory in the high energy limit. We find an
unexpected from the gauge theory perspective `gravity-like' s^1 behaviour of
the amplitudes coming from bulk graviton exchange. The details of the
calculations are presented in hep-th/9907177.
