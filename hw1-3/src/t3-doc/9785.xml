<title>
Semi-infinite throats at finite temperature and static solutions in
  exactly solvable models of 2d dilaton gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Found is a general form of static solutions in exactly solvable models of 2d
dilaton gravity at finite temperature. We reveal a possibility for the
existence of everywhere regular solutions including black holes, semi-infinite
throats and star-like configurations. In particular, we consider the
Bose-Parker-Peleg (BPP) model which possesses a semi-infinite throat and
analyze it at finite temperature. We also suggest generalization of the BPP
model in which the appearance of semi-infinite throat has a generic character
and does not need special fine tuning between parameters of the solution.
