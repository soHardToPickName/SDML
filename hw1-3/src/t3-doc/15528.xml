<title>
Spatial Geometry and the Wu-Yang Ambiguity
</title>

<abstract>
  We display continuous families of SU(2) vector potentials $A_i^a(x)$ in 3
space dimensions which generate the same magnetic field $B^{ai}(x)$ (with det
$B\neq 0$). These Wu-Yang families are obtained from the Einstein equation
$R_{ij}=-2G_{ij}$ derived recently via a local map of the gauge field system
into a spatial geometry with $2$-tensor $G_{ij}=B^a{}_i B^a{}_j\det B$ and
connection $\Gamma_{jk}^i$ with torsion defined from gauge covariant
derivatives of $B$.
