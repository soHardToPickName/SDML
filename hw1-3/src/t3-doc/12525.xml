Unitary-Matrix Integration on 2D Yang-Mills Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the idea of Itzykson-Zuber integral, unitary-matrix integration of 2D
Yang-Mills action is presented. The uniqueness of the solution of heat equation
enables us to integrate out the unitary-matrix parts of hermite matrices and to
obtain the expression of integration over vectors, also in this case.
