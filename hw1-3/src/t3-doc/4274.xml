<title>
On the N=1 beta-function from the conifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the correct all-loop beta-function of pure N=1 super Yang-Mills
theory from the supergravity solution of the warped deformed conifold,
including also some nonperturbative corrections. The crucial ingredient is the
gauge-gravity relation that can be inferred by taking into account the
phenomenon of gaugino condensation.
