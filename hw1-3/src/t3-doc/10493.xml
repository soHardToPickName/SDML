<title>
Quantum fields in anti de Sitter spacetime and degrees of freedom in the
  bulk/boundary correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization of a scalar field in anti de Sitter spacetime using
Poincar\'e coordinates is considered. We find a discrete spectrum that is
consistent with a possible mapping between bulk and boundary quantum states.
