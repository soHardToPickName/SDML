<title>
Interacting noncommutative solitons (vacua)
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the dynamics of two interacting lumps/solitons in a
noncommutative gauge model. We show that equations of motion describing this
dynamics can be reduced to ones of a two-dimensional mechanical system which is
well studied and was shown to exhibit stochastic behaviour.
