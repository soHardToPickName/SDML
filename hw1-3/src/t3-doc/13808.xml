<title>
Noncommutative Compactifications of Type I Strings on Tori with Magnetic
  Background Flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct six- and four-dimensional toroidal compactifications of the Type
I string with magnetic flux on the D-branes. The open strings in this
background probe a noncommutative internal geometry. Phenomenologically
appealing features such as chiral fermions and supersymmetry breaking in the
gauge sector are naturally realized by these vacua. We investigate the spectra
of such noncommutative string compactifications and in a bottom-up approach
discuss the possibility to obtain the standard or some GUT like model.
