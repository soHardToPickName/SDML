Duality in Gravity and Higher Spin Gauge Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Dual field theory realisations are given for linearised gravity in terms of
gauge fields in exotic representations of the Lorentz group. The field
equations and dual representations are discussed for a wide class of higher
spin gauge fields. For non-linear Einstein gravity, such transformations can be
implemented locally in light-cone gauge, or partially implemented in the
presence of a Killing vector. Sources and the relation to Kaluza-Klein
monopoles are discussed.
