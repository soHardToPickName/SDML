Supergravity Solutions for BI Dyons
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct partially localized supergravity counterpart solutions to the
1/2 supersymmetric non-threshold and the 1/4 supersymmetric threshold bound
state BI dyons in the D3-brane Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. Such supergravity
solutions have all the parameters of the BI dyons. By applying the IIA/IIB
T-duality transformations to these supergravity solutions, we obtain the
supergravity counterpart solutions to 1/2 and 1/4 supersymmetric BIons carrying
electric and magnetic charges of the worldvolume U(1) gauge field in the
Dirac-Born-Infeld theory in other dimensions.
