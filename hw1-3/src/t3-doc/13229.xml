<title>
A note on regular type 0 solutions and confining gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some features of the regular supergravity solution for fractional
branes on a deformed conifold, recently found by Klebanov-Strassler, mostly
adapting it to a type 0 non-sypersymmetric context. The non-supersymmetric
gauge theory is SU(M)*SU(M) with two bi-fundamental Weyl fermions. The tachyon
is now stabilized by the RR antisymmetric tensor flux. We briefly discuss the
most general non-supersymmetric theory on electric, magnetic and fractional
type 0 D3-branes on a conifold. This includes the pure SU(N) theory.
