On the Gauge Invariance of the Chern-Simons Action for N D-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short note we provide a proof that the Chern-Simons part of the
action for N D-branes is invariant under gauge transformations of the RR fields
of the type C_p ->C_p + d\Lambda_{p-1}, and rewrite the action in a form that
makes this symmetry manifest.
