<title>
Chiral bosonization as a Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We demonstrate that the technique of abelian bosonization through duality
transformations can be extended to gauging anomalous symmetries. The example of
a Dirac fermion theory is first illustrated. This idea is then also applied to
bosonize a chiral fermion by gauging its chiral phase symmetry.
