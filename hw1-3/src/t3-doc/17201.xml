Duality and Scaling in Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The nonadiabatic geometric phase in a time dependent quantum evolution is
shown to provide an intrinsic concept of time having dual properties relative
to the external time. A nontrivial extension of the ordinary quantum mechanics
is thus obtained with interesting scaling laws. A fractal like structure in
time is thus revealed.
