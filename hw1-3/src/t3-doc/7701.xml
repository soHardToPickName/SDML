<title>
Noncommutative Geometry, Strings and Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk, based on work done in collaboration with G. Landi and R.J
Szabo, I will review how string theory can be considered as a noncommutative
geometry based on an algebra of vertex operators. The spectral triple of
strings is introduced, and some of the string symmetries, notably target space
duality, are discussed in this framework.
