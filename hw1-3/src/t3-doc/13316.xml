ELLIPTIC MONOPOLES AND (4,0)-SUPERSYMMETRIC SIGMA MODELS WITH TORSION
</title>

<abstract>
  We explicitly construct the metric and torsion couplings of two-dimensional
(4,0)-super\-sym\-metric sigma models with target space a four-manifold that
are invariant under a $U(1)$ symmetry generated by a tri-holomorphic Killing
vector field that leaves in addition the torsion invariant. We show that the
metric couplings arise from magnetic monopoles on the three-sphere which is the
space of orbits of the group action generated by the tri-holomorphic Killing
vector field on the sigma model target manifold. We also examine the global
structure of a subclass of these metrics that are in addition $SO(3)$-invariant
and find that the only non-singular one, for models with non-zero torsion, is
that of $SU(2)\times U(1)$ WZW model.
