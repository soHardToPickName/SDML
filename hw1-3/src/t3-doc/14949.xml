Renormalisation Group Flows and Conserved Vector Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  Irreversibility of RG flows in two dimensions is shown using conserved vector
currents. Out of a conserved vector current, a quantity decreasing along the RG
flow is built up such that it is stationary at fixed points where it coincides
with the constant coefficient of the two current correlation function. For
Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten models this constant coefficient is the level of
their associated affine Lie algebra. Extensions to higher dimensions using the
spectral decomposition of the two current correlation function are studied.
