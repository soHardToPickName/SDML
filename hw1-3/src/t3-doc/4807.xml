Boundary Poisson structure and quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach for treating boundary Poisson structures based on causality
and locality analysis is proposed for a single scalar field with boundary
interaction. For the case of linear boundary condition, it is shown that the
usual canonical quantization can be applied systematically.
