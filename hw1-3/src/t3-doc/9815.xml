<title>
The Frobenius-Schur indicator in Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  An analogue of the classical Frobenius-Schur indicator is introduced in order
to distinguish between real and pseudo-real self-conjugate primary fields, and
an explicit expression for this quantity is derived from the trace of the
braiding operator.
