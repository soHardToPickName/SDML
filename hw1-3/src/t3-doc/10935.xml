<title>
Higher-Spin Gauge Interactions for Matter Fields in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate a new model which describes higher-spin gauge interactions for
matter fields in two dimensions. This model is a higher-spin generalization of
d2 gravity and turns out to be integrable. No vanishing higher-spin current
conditions are imposed on the matter fields.
