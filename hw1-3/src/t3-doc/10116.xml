<title>
Anomaly cancellation in D=4, N=1 orientifolds and linear/chiral
  multiplet duality
</title>

<abstract>
  It has been proposed that gauge and Kaehler anomalies in four-dimensional
type IIB orientifolds are cancelled by a generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism
involving exchange of twisted RR-fields. We explain how this can be understood
using the well-known duality between linear and chiral multiplets. We find that
all the twisted fields associated to the N=1 sectors and some of the fields
associated to the N=2 sectors reside in linear multiplets. But there are no
linear multiplets associated to order-two twists. Only the linear multiplets
contribute to anomaly cancellation. This suffices to cancel all U(1) anomalies.
In the case of Kaehler symmetries the complete SL(2,R) can be restored at the
quantum level for all planes that are not fixed by an order-two twist.
