Enveloping algebra valued gauge transformations for non-abelian gauge
  groups on non-commutative spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  An enveloping algebra valued gauge field is constructed, its components are
functions of the Lie algebra valued gauge field and can be constructed with the
Seiberg-Witten map. This allows the formulation of a dynamics for a finite
number of gauge field components on non-commutative spaces.
