On the Phenomenology of Tachyon Radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief overview of the different kinds of electromagnetic
radiations expected to come from (or to be induced by) space-like sources
(tachyons). New domains of radiation are here considered; and the possibility
of experimental observation of tachyons via electromagnetic radiation is
discussed.
