<title>
Vacuum energies for the relativistic Landau problem
</title>

<abstract>
  We study, through zeta-function techniques, the vacuum energies for Dirac
fields in a constant magnetic background. We consider the combined effect of
the background and twisted boundary conditions. The required charge
renormalization is discussed in each case.
