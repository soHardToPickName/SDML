<title>
One particular approach to the non-equilibrium quantum dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a particular approach to the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum
field theory. This approach is based on the Jaynes-Gibbs principle of the
maximal entropy and its implementation, throghout the initial value data, into
the dynamical equations for Green's functions.
