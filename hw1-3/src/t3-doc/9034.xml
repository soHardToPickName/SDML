<title>
Integrability and Scheme-Independence of Even Dimensional Quantum
  Geometry Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate how the integrability conditions for conformal anomalies
constrain the form of the effective action in even-dimensional quantum
geometry. We show that the effective action of four-dimensional quantum
geometry (4DQG) satisfying integrability has a manifestly diffeomorphism
invariant and regularization scheme-independent form. We then generalize the
arguments to six dimensions and propose a model of 6DQG. A hypothesized form of
the 6DQG effective action is given.
