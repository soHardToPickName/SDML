<title>
Elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model via the Poisson reduction of the
  Affine Heisenberg Double
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the elliptic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model can be obtained
from the affine Heisenberg Double by means of the Poisson reduction procedure.
The dynamical $r$-matrix naturally appears in the construction.
