<title>
Semilocal Self-Dual Chern-Simons Solitons and Toda-type Eqations
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a nonrelativistic Chern-Simons theory of planar matter fields
interacting with the Chern-Simons gauge field in a $SU(N)_{global} \times
U(1)_{local}$ invariant fashion. We find that this model admits static
zero-energy self-dual soliton solutions. We also present a set of exact soliton
solutions. The exact time-dependent solutions are also obtained, when this
model is considered in the background of an external uniform magnetic field.
