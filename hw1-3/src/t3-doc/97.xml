<title>
Difficulties in Inducing a Gauge Theory at Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the recently proposed Kazakov-Migdal model of induced gauge
theory, at large $N$, involves only the zero area Wilson loops that are
effectively trees in the gauge action induced by the scalars. This retains only
a constant part of the gauge action excluding plaquettes or anything like them
and the gauge variables drop out.
