<title>
Symplectic Quantization for Reducible Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We study an extension of the symplectic formalism in order to quantize
reducible systems. We show that a procedure like {\it ghost-of-ghost} of the
BFV method can be applied in terms of Lagrange multipliers. We use the
developed formalism to quantize the antisymmetric Abelian gauge fields.
