Nambu-Goldstone Fields, Anomalies and WZ Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the Wess-Zumino terms from anomalies in case of quasigroups for
the following situations. One is effective gauge field theories of
Nambu-Goldstone fields associated with spontaneously broken global symmetries
and the other is anomalous gauge theories. The formalism that we will develop
can be seen as a generalization of the non-linear realization method of Lie
groups. As an example we consider 2d gravity with a Weyl invariant
regularization
