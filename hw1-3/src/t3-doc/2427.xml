<title>
Regular cosmological solutions in low energy effective action from
  string theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The possibility of obtaining singularity free cosmological solutions in four
dimensional effective actions motivated by string theory is investigated. In
these effective actions, besides the Einstein-Hilbert term, the dilatonic and
the axionic fields are also considered as well as terms coming from the
Ramond-Ramond sector. A radiation fluid is coupled to the field equations,
which appears as a consequence of the Maxwellian terms in the Ramond-Ramond
sector. Singularity free bouncing solutions in which the dilaton is finite and
strictly positive are obtained for models with flat or negative curvature
spatial sections when the dilatonic coupling constant is such that $\omega < -
3/2$, and only for models with negative curvature spatial sections when $\omega
> - 3/2$, including the pure string case $\omega=-1$. The bounces are smoothly
connected to the radiation dominated expansion phase of the standard
cosmological model, and the asymptotic pasts correspond to very large flat
spacetimes.
