Comments on information loss and remnants
</title>

<abstract>
  The information loss and remnant proposals for resolving the black hole
information paradox are reconsidered. It is argued that in typical cases
information loss implies energy loss, and thus can be thought of in terms of
coupling to a spectrum of ``fictitious'' remnants. This suggests proposals for
information loss that do not imply planckian energy fluctuations in the low
energy world. However, if consistency of gravity prevents energy
non-conservation, these remnants must then be considered to be real. In either
case, the catastrophe corresponding to infinite pair production remains a
potential problem. Using Reissner-Nordstrom black holes as a paradigm for a
theory of remnants, it is argued that couplings in such a theory may give
finite production despite an infinite spectrum. Evidence for this is found in
analyzing the instanton for Schwinger production; fluctuations from the
infinite number of states lead to a divergent stress tensor, spoiling the
instanton calculation. Therefore naive arguements for infinite production fail.
