<title>
Induced QCD Without Local Confinement
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine some properties of the filled Wilson loop observables in the
Kazakov-Migdal model of induced QCD. We show that they have a natural
interpretation in a modification of the original model in which the $Z_N$ gauge
symmetry is broken explicitly by a Wilson kinetic term for the gauge fields. We
argue that there are two large N limits of this theory, one leads to ordinary
Wilson lattice gauge theory coupled to a dynamical scalar field and the other
leads to a version of the Kazakov-Migdal model in which the large N solution
found by Migdal can still be used. We discuss the properties of the string
theory which emerges.
