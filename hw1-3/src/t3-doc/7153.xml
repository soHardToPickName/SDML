<title>
Vector Casimir effect for a D-dimensional sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir energy or stress due to modes in a D-dimensional volume subject
to TM (mixed) boundary conditions on a bounding spherical surface is
calculated. Both interior and exterior modes are included. Together with
earlier results found for scalar modes (TE modes), this gives the Casimir
effect for fluctuating ``electromagnetic'' (vector) fields inside and outside a
spherical shell. Known results for three dimensions, first found by Boyer, are
reproduced. Qualitatively, the results for TM modes are similar to those for
scalar modes: Poles occur in the stress at positive even dimensions, and cusps
(logarithmic singularities) occur for integer dimensions $D\le1$. Particular
attention is given the interesting case of D=2.
