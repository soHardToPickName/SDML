<title>
On the fate of singularities and horizons in higher derivative gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study static spherically symmetric solutions of high derivative gravity
theories, with 4, 6, 8 and even 10 derivatives. Except for isolated points in
the space of theories with more than 4 derivatives, only solutions that are
nonsingular near the origin are found. But these solutions cannot smooth out
the Schwarzschild singularity without the appearance of a second horizon. This
conundrum, and the possibility of singularities at finite r, leads us to study
numerical solutions of theories truncated at four derivatives. Rather than two
horizons we are led to the suggestion that the original horizon is replaced by
a rapid nonsingular transition from weak to strong gravity. We also consider
this possibility for the de Sitter horizon.
