<title>
Global counterpart of $k$-Poincare algebra and covariant wave functions
</title>

<abstract>
  The global counterpart of $k$-Poincare algebra is considered. The induced
representations of this group are described. The explicit form of the covariant
wave functions in the `minimal' (in Weinberg's sense) case is given.
