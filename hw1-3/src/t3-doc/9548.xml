General Abelian Orientifold Models and One Loop Amplitudes
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a one loop amplitude for any Abelian orientifold point group for
arbitary complex dimensions. From this we show several results for orientifolds
in this general class of models as well as for low dimensional
compactifications. We also discuss the importance and structure of the
contribution of orientifold planes to the dynamics of D-branes, and give a
physical explaination for the inconsistency of certain Z_4 models as discovered
by Zwart.
