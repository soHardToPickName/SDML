<title>
A New Angle on Intersecting Branes in Infinite Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  I construct solutions to Einstein's equations in 6 dimensions with bulk
cosmological constant and intersecting 4-branes. Solutions exist for a
continuous range of 4-brane tension, with long distance gravity localized to a
3+1 dimensional Minkowski intersection, provided that the additional tension of
the intersection satisfies one condition.
