D-branes in AdS_3xS^3xS^3xS^1
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse the possible D-brane configurations in an AdS_3xS^3xS^3xS^1
background with a NS-NS B field, by using the boundary state formalism. We
study their geometry and we determine the fraction of spacetime supersymmetry
preserved by these solutions.
