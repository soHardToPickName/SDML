Asymptotic Regimes in Quantum Gravity at Large Distances and Running
  Newtonian and Cosmological Constants
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a multiplicatively renormalizable higher-derivative scalar theory
which is used as an effective theory for quantum gravity at large distances
(infrared phase of quantum gravity). The asymptotic regimes (in particular, the
asymptotically free infrared regime) for the coupling constants ---specifically
the Newtonian and the cosmological constant--- are obtained. The running of the
Newton and cosmological constants in the infrared asymptotically free regime
may be relevant for solving the cosmological constant problem and for
estimating the leading-log corrections to the static gravitational potential.
