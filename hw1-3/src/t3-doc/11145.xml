Uncertainty relation and non-dispersive states in Finite Quantum
  Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter, we provide evidence for a classical sector of states in the
Hilbert space of Finite Quantum Mechanics (FQM). We construct a subset of
states whose the minimum bound of position -momentum uncertainty (equivalent to
an effective $\hbar$) vanishes. The classical regime, contrary to standard
Quantum Mechanical Systems of particles and fields, but also of strings and
branes appears in short distances of the order of the lattice spacing. {}For
linear quantum maps of long periods, we observe that time evolution leads to
fast decorrelation of the wave packets, phenomenon similar to the behavior of
wave packets in t' Hooft and Susskind holographic picture. Moreoever, we
construct explicitly a non - dispersive basis of states in accordance with t'
Hooft's arguments about the deterministic behavior of FQM.
