<title>
Orientifolds, RR Torsion, and K-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the role of RR fluxes in orientifold backgrounds from the point of
view of K-theory, and demonstrate some physical implications of describing
these fluxes in K-theory rather than cohomology. In particular, we show that
certain fractional shifts in RR charge quantization due to discrete RR fluxes
are naturally explained in K-theory. We also show that some orientifold
backgrounds, which are considered distinct in the cohomology classification,
become equivalent in the K-theory description, while others become unphysical.
