<title>
Probing a D6 + D0 state with D6-branes: SYM - Supergravity
  correspondence at subleading level
</title>

<abstract>
  We probe a non-supersymmetric D6 + D0 state with D6-branes and find agreement
at subleading order between the supergravity and super Yang-Mills description
of the long-distance, low-velocity interaction.
