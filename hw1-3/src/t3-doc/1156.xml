<title>
Noncommutative Open String: Neutral and Charged
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the quantization of open string in NS-NS background and demonstrate
that its endpoint becomes noncommutative. The same approach allows us to
determine the noncommutativity that arises for a charged open string in
background gauge fields. While NS-NS background is relevant for ``worldvolume''
noncommutativity, a simple argument suggests that RR background is likely to be
relevant for ``spacetime'' noncommutativity.
