N-Point Deformation of Algebraic K3 Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider N-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces. First, we construct
two-point deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces by considering algebraic
deformation of a pair of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces. In this case, the
moduli space of the noncommutative deformations is of dimension 19, the same as
the moduli dimension of the complex deformations of commutative algebraic K3
surfaces. Then, we extend this method to the N-point case. In the N-point case,
the dimension of deformation moduli space becomes 19N(N-1)/2.
