<title>
Quantum Cohomology of Partial Flag Manifolds and a Residue Formula for
  Their Intersection Parings
</title>

<abstract>
  As a generalization of our previous paper [GK], we formulate a residue
formula and some simple behaviors of equivariant quantum cohomology applying to
compute the quantum cohomology of partial flag manifolds $F_{k_1,\cdots , k_l}
$with a try to give a rigorous definition of equivariant quantum cohomology.
