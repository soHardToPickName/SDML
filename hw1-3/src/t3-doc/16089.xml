Gauge Independent Trace Anomaly for Gravitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the trace anomaly for gravitons calculated using the usual
effective action formalism depends on the choice of gauge when the background
spacetime is not a solution of the classical equation of motion, that is, when
off-shell. We then use the gauge independent Vilkovisky-DeWitt effective action
to restore gauge independence to the off-shell case. Additionally we explicitly
evaluate trace anomalies for some N-sphere background spacetimes.
