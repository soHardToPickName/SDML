An Anyon Primer
</title>

<abstract>
  In this set of lectures, we give a pedagogical introduction to the subject of
anyons. We discuss 1) basic concepts in anyon physics, 2) quantum mechanics of
two anyon systems, 3) statistical mechanics of many anyon systems, 4) mean
field approach to many anyon systems and anyon superconductivity, 5) anyons in
field theory and 6) anyons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE). (Based
on lectures delivered at the VII SERC school in High Energy Physics at the
Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad, January 1992 and at the I SERC school
in Statistical Mechanics at Puri, February 1994.)
