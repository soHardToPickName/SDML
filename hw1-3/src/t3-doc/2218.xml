Gravity induced over a smooth soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  I consider gravity induced over a smooth (finite thickness) soliton. Graviton
kinetic term is coupled to bulk scalar that develops solitonic vacuum
expectation value. Couplings of Kaluza-Klein modes to soliton-localized matter
are suppressed, giving rise to crossover distance $r_c=M_{P}^2/M_{*}^3$ between
4D and 5D behavior. This system can be viewed as a finite thickness brane
regularization of the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and Porrati.
