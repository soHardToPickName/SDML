<title>
Fermionic String from Abelian Higgs Model with monopoles and
  $\Theta$-term
</title>

<abstract>
  The four dimensional Abelian Higgs model with monopoles and $\Theta$-term is
considered in the limit of the large mass of the higgs boson. We show that for
$\Theta=2 \pi$ the theory is equivalent, at large distances, to summation over
all possible world-sheets of fermionic strings with Dirichlet type boundary
conditions on string coordinates.
