<title>
The Strong Perturbation Approach for the Dirac Equation in a Gauge Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a possible approach to the problem of a gauge theory with a strong
coupling constant. It is seen that, instead of plane waves, we have to consider
the adiabatic eigenstates of the perturbation in order to get a meaningful
perturbation approach.
