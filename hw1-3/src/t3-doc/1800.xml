<title>
Mass Generation in Continuum SU(2) Gauge Theory in Covariant Abelian
  Gauges
</title>

<abstract>
  The local action of an SU(2) gauge theory in general covariant Abelian gauges
and the associated equivariant BRST symmetry that guarantees the perturbative
renormalizability of the model are given. I show that a global SL(2,R) symmetry
of the model is spontaneously broken by ghost-antighost condensation at
arbitrarily small coupling and leads to propagators that are finite at
Euclidean momenta for all elementary fields except the Abelian ``photon''. The
Goldstone states form a BRST-quartet. The mechanism eliminates the non-abelian
infrared divergences in the perturbative high-temperature expansion of the free
energy.
