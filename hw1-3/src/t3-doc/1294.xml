<title>
On heavy states in supersymmetric gluodynamics at large N
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that there are states (quasiparticles) with masses ranging over
the scales $\Lambda N_{c}^{1/3} \div \Lambda N_{c}$ in N=1 supersymmetric
multicolor gluodynamics. These states exist in the form of quantum bubbles made
out of the BPS domain walls. Analogous states are likely to exist in
non-supersymmetric case as well.
