<title>
The Superfield Formalism Applied to the Noncommutative Wess-Zumino Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce the notion of superoperators on noncommutative R^4 and
re-investigate in the framework of superfields the noncommutative Wess-Zumino
model as a quantum field theory. In a highly efficient manner we are able to
confirm the result that this model is renormalizable to all orders.
