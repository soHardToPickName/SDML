<title>
Point-Like Structure in Strings and Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamics of a free point particle on a multi world-line is presented and
shown to reduce to that of a bosonic string theory at the appropriate limit.
Other higher dimensional extended objects are argued to appear at other regions
of the space of configurations of the theory.
