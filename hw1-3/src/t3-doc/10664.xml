<title>
Induced wormholes due to quantum effects of spherically reduced matter
  in large N approximation
</title>

<abstract>
  Using one-loop effective action in large N and s-wave approximation we
discuss the possibility to induce primordial wormholes at the early Universe.
An analytical solution is found for self-consistent primordial wormhole with
constant radius. Numerical study gives the wormhole solution with increasing
throat radius and increasing red-shift function. There is also some indication
to the possibility of a topological phase transition.
