The Power of Holomorphy -- Exact Results in 4D SUSY Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Holomorphy of the superpotential and of the coefficient of the gauge kinetic
terms in supersymmetric theories lead to powerful results. They are the
underlying conceptual reason for the important non-renormalization theorems.
They also enable us to study the exact non-perturbative dynamics of these
theories. We find explicit realizations of known phenomena as well as new ones
in four dimensional strongly coupled field theories. These shed new light on
confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. This note is based on a talk
delivered at the PASCOS (94) meeting at Syracuse University.
