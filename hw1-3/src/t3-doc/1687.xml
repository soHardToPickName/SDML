<title>
Massive Gauge Axion Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  A gauge invariant formulation for the massive axion is considered. The axion
acquires mass through a topological term which couples a (pseudo)scalar and a
third rank antisymmetric tensor. Duality, local and canonical equivalences with
the non-gauge invariant proposal are established. The supersymmetric version of
the gauge invariant model is constructed.
