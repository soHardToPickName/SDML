Phenomenological Aspects of F-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Stabilizing a heterotic string vacuum with a large expectation value of the
dilaton and simultaneously breaking low-energy supersymmetry is a long-standing
problem of string phenomenology. We reconsider these issues in light of the
recent developments in F-theory.
