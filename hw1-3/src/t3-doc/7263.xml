CP violation and CKM predictions from Discrete Torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a supersymmetric D-brane model that has CP spontaneously broken by
discrete torsion. The low energy physics is largely independent of the
compactification scheme and the kahler metric has `texture zeros' dictated by
the choice of discrete torsion. This motivates a simple ansatz for the kahler
metric which results in a CKM matrix given in terms of two free parameters,
hence we predict a single mixing angle and the CKM phase. The CKM phase is
predicted to be close to Pi/3.
