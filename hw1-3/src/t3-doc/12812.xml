D-branes in pp-wave spacetime with nonconstant NS-NS flux
</title>

<abstract>
  We find classical solutions of D-branes in pp-wave spacetime with nonconstant
NS-NS flux. We also present Dp-Dp' bound state solutions in this background. We
further analyze the supersymmetric properties of these brane solutions by
solving the type IIB killing spinor equations explicitly.
