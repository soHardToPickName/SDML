Variational Multi-Time Green's Functions for Nonequilibrium Quantum
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  The time-dependent variational principle proposed by Balian and Veneroni is
used to provide the best approximation to the generating functional for
multi-time Green's functions of a set of (bosonic) observables $Q_{\mu)$. By
suitably restricting the trial spaces, the computation of the two-time Green's
function, obtained by a second order expansion in the sources, is considerably
simplified. This leads to a tractable formalism suited to quantum fields out
of equilibrium. We propose an illustration on the finite temperature
${\bf\Phi^4}$ theory in curved space and coupled to gravity.
