<title>
The Emergence of Localized Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore physics on the boundary of a Randall-Sundrum type model when the
brane tension is slightly sub-critical. We calculate the masses of the
Kaluza-Klein decomposition of the graviton and use a toy model to show how
localized gravity emerges as the brane tension becomes critical. Finally, we
discuss some aspects of the boundary conformal field theory and the AdS/CFT
correspondence.
