<title>
Vect(N) conformal fields and their exterior derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  Conformal fields are a recently discovered class of representations of the
algebra of vector fields in $N$ dimensions. Invariant first-order differential
operators (exterior derivatives) for conformal fields are constructed.
