<title>
The Light-Cone Field Theory Paradigm for Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first part of this lecture I will give an introduction to light-cone
field theory, focussing on the ``zero mode problem''. In the second part I
discuss $\phi^4$-theory in 1+1 dimensions. I will show how the dynamics of the
zero modes can give rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking in spite of the
trivial vacuum structure on the light-cone.
