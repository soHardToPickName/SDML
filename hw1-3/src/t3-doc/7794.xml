String Islands
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss string theories with small numbers of non-compact moduli and
describe constructions of string theories whose low-energy limit is described
by various pure supergravity theories. We also construct a D=4,N=4
compactification of type II string theory with 34 vector fields.
