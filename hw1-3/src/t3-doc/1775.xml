Hopf Solitons on S^3 and R^3
</title>

<abstract>
  The Skyrme-Faddeev system, a modified O(3) sigma model in three space
dimensions, admits topological solitons with nonzero Hopf number. One may learn
something about these solitons by considering the system on the 3-sphere of
radius R. In particular, the Hopf map is a solution which is unstable for R >
\sqrt{2}.
