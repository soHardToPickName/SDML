Noncommutative Supersymmetry in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on an argument for the noncommutativity of momenta in noncommutative
directions, we arrive at a generalization of the ${\cal N}=1$ super $E^2$
algebra associated to the deformation of translations in a noncommutative
Euclidean plane. The algebra is obtained using appropriate representaions of
its generators on the space of superfields in a $D=2, {\cal N}=1$
``noncommutative superspace.'' We find that the (anti)commutators between
several (super)translation generators are no longer vanishing, but involve a
new set of generators which together with the (super)translation and rotation
generators form a consistent closed algebra. We then analyze the spectrum of
this algebra in order to obtain its fundamental and adjoint representations.
