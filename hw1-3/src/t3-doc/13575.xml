<title>
Hedgehogs in higher dimensional gravity with curvature self-interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  Static solutions of the higher dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity
supplemented by quadratic curvature self-interactions are discussed in the
presence of hedgehog configurations along the transverse dimensions. The
quadratic part of the action is parametrized in terms of the (ghost-free)
Euler-Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant. Spherically symmetric profiles of the
transverse metric admit exponentially decaying warp factors both for positive
and negative bulk cosmological constants.
