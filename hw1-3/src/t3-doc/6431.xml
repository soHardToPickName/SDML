<title>
Conical Singularities in Three or Four-Dimensions and Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We present mechanisms for generating conical singularities both in three and
four-dimensions in the systems with copies of scalar or chiral multiplets
coupled to $N=2$ or $N=1$ supergravity. Our mechanisms are useful for
supersymmetry breaking, maintaining the zero cosmological constants in three
and four-dimensions. A strong coupling duality connecting these two
dimensionalities is also studied.
