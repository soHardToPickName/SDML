Detailed analysis of the dependence of the one-loop counterterms on the
  gauge and parametrization in the Einstein gravity with the cosmological
  constant
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper, the dependence of the Einstein gravity with the cosmological
constant as well as of this theory in the first-order formalism on the gauge
and parametrization is been analyzed. The one-loop counterterms off the mass
shell have been plainly calculated in arbitrary gauge and parametrization. The
tensor package of analytic calculations, written in REDUCE, allowed all the
calculations to be carried out. A method of renormalization group functions
calculations off shell is discussed.
