<title>
Double Trace Deformations, Infinite Extra Dimensions and Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  It was recently shown how to break supersymmetry in certain $AdS_3$ spaces,
without destabilizing the background, by using a ``double trace'' deformation
which localizes on the boundary of space-time. By viewing spatial sections of
$AdS_3$ as a compactification space, one can convert this into a SUSY breaking
mechanism which exists uniformly throughout a large 3+1 dimensional space-time,
without generating any dangerous tadpoles. This is a generalization of a Visser
type infinite extra dimensions compactification. Although the model is not
Lorentz invariant, the dispersion relation is relativistic at high enough
momenta, and it can be arranged such that at the same kinematical regime the
energy difference between between former members of a SUSY multiplet is large.
