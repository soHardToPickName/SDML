<title>
The Continuous Series of Critical Points of the Two-Matrix Model at N ->
  infinity in the Double Scaling Limit
</title>

<abstract>
  The critical points of the continuous series are characterized by two complex
numbers l_1,l_2 (Re(l_1,l_2)< 0), and a natural number n (n>=3) which enters
the string susceptibility constant through gamma = -2/(n-1). The critical
potentials are analytic functions with a convergence radius depending on l_1 or
l_2. We use the orthogonal polynomial method and solve the Schwinger-Dyson
equations with a technique borrowed from conformal field theory.
