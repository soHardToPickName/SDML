<title>
The Renormalization Structure and Quantum Equivalence of 2D Dilaton
  Gravities
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective action corresponding the general model of dilaton
gravity given by the Lagrangian $L=-\sqrt{g} \left[ \frac{1}{2}Z(\Phi )
g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi + C(\Phi ) R + V (\Phi
)\right]$, where $Z(\Phi )$, $ C(\Phi )$ and $V (\Phi )$ are arbitrary
functions of the dilaton field, is found. The question of the quantum
equivalence of classically equivalent dilaton gravities is studied. By specific
calculation of explicit examples it is shown that classically equivalent
quantum gravities are also perturbatively equivalent at the quantum level, but
only on-shell. The renormalization group equations for the generalized
effective couplings $Z(\Phi )$, $ C(\Phi )$ and $V (\Phi )$ are written. An
analysis of the equations shows, in particular, that the
Callan-Giddings-Harvey-Strominger model is not a fixed point of these
equations.
