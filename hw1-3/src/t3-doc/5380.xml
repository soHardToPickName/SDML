Field Theory of Tachyon Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a field theory for describing the tachyon on a brane-antibrane
system near the minimum of the potential. This field theory realizes two known
properties of the tachyon effective action: 1) absence of plane-wave solutions
around the minimum, and 2) exponential fall off of the pressure at late time as
the tachyon field evolves from any spatially homogeneous initial configuration
towards the minimum of the potential. Classical solutions in this field theory
include non-relativistic matter with arbitrary spatial distribution of energy.
