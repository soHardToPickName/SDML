Nonassociative geometry: Towards discrete structure of spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of nonassociative geometry (hep-th/0003238) a unified
description of continuum and discrete spacetime is proposed. In our approach at
the Planck scales the spacetime is described as a so-called "diodular discrete
structure" which at large spacetime scales `looks like' a differentiable
manifold. After a brief review of foundations of nonassociative geometry,we
discuss the nonassociative smooth and discrete de Sitter spacetimes.
