<title>
Lorentz Symmetry Breaking in Abelian Vector-Field Models with
  Wess-Zumino Interaction
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the abelian vector-field models in the presence of the
Wess-Zumino interaction with the pseudoscalar matter. The occurence of the
dynamic breaking of Lorentz symmetry at classical and one-loop level is
described for massless and massive vector fields. This phenomenon appears to be
the non-perturbative counterpart of the perturbative renormalizability and/or
unitarity breaking in the chiral gauge theories.
