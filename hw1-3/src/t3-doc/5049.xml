Algebra and Twisted Algebra in Toroidal Target Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Target space duality is reconsidered from the viewpoint of quantization in a
space with nontrivial topology. An algebra of operators for the toroidal
bosonic string is defined and its representations are constructed. It is shown
that there exist an infinite number of inequivalent quantizations, which are
parametrized by two parameters $ 0 \le s, t < 1 $. The spectrum exhibits the
duality only when $ s = t $ or $ -t $ (mod 1). A deformation of the algebra by
a central extension is also introduced. It leads to a kind of twisted relation
between the zero mode quantum number and the topological winding number.
