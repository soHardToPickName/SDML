Particle creation by moving spherical shell in the dynamical Casimir
  effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The creation of massless scalar particles from the quantum vacuum by
spherical shell with time varying radius is studied. In the general case of
motion the equations are derived for the instantaneous basis expansion
coefficients. The examples are considered when the mean number of particles can
be explicitly evaluated in the adiabatic approximation.
