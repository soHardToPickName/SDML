On the Structure of Quantum Gauge Theories with External Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider generating functionals of Green's functions with external fields
in the framework of BV and BLT quantization schemes for general gauge theories.
The corresponding Ward identities are obtained, and the gauge dependence is
studied.
