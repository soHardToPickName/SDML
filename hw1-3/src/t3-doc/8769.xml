<title>
Exterior Differentials in Superspace and Poisson Brackets of Diverse
  Grassmann Parities
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that two definitions for the exterior differential in superspace,
giving the same exterior calculus, when applied to the Poisson bracket lead to
the different results. Examples of the even and odd linear brackets,
corresponding to semi-simple Lie groups, are given and their natural connection
with BRST and anti-BRST charges is indicated.
