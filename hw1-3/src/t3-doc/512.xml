<title>
Kostant's cubic Dirac operator of Lie Superalgebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend equal rank embedding of reductive Lie algebras to that of basic Lie
superalgebras. The Kac character formulas for equal rank embedding are derived
in terms of subalgebras and Kostant's cubic Dirac operator for equal rank
embedding of Lie superalgebras is constructed from both even and odd generators
and their related structure constants.
