<title>
Homogeneous Conformal String Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present exact solutions characterised by Bianchi-type I,II,III,V,VI
four-dimensional metric, space-independent dilaton, and vanishing torsion
background, for the low energy string effective action with zero central charge
deficit. We show that, in such a context, curvature singularities cannot be
avoided, except for the trivial case of flat spacetime and constant dilaton. We
also provide a further example of the failure of the standard prescription for
connecting conformal string backgrounds through duality transformations
associated to non-semisimple, non-Abelian isometry group.
