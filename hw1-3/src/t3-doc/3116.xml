<title>
Strongly Coupled Quantum and Classical Systems and Zeno's Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  A model interaction between a two-state quantum system and a classical
switching device is analysed and shown to lead to the quantum Zeno effect for
large values of the coupling constant k . A minimal piecewise deterministic
random process compatible with the Liouville equation is described, and it is
shown that 1/k can be interpreted as the jump frequency of the classical device
