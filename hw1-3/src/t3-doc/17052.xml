The Asymptotic Dynamics of two-dimensional (anti-)de Sitter Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the asymptotic dynamics of two-dimensional de Sitter or anti-de
Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity is described by a generalized
two-particle Calogero-Sutherland model. This correspondence is established by
formulating the JT model of (A)dS gravity in two dimensions as a topological
gauge theory, which reduces to a nonlinear 0+1-dimensional sigma model on the
boundary of (A)dS space. The appearance of cyclic coordinates allows then a
further reduction to the Calogero-Sutherland quantum mechanical model.
