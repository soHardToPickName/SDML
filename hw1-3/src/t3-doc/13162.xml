<title>
Pre-big bang on the brane
</title>

<abstract>
  The equations of motion and junction conditions for a gravi-dilaton brane
world scenario are studied in the string frame. It is shown that they allow
Kasner-like solutions on the brane, which makes the dynamics of the brane very
similar to the low curvature phase of pre-big bang cosmology. Analogies and
differences of this scenario with the Randall-Sundrum one and with the standard
bulk pre-big bang dynamics are also discussed.
