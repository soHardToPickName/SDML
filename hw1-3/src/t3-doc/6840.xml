Exact Heavy To Light Meson Form Factors In The Chiral Limit Of Planar
  1+1 QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The form factors of the flavor changing vector current between a $\bar q
Q$-meson and the lightest $\bar q q$ (pseudoscalar-)meson are computed exactly
and explicitly in the 't~Hooft model (planar QCD in $1+1$ dimensions) in the
limit that the mass of $q$-quark vanishes.
