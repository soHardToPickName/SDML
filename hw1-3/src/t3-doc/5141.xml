<title>
Gauge Invariance in Quantum Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Contrary to the conventional view point of quantization that breaks the gauge
symmetry, a gauge invariant formulation of quantum electrodynamics is proposed.
Instead of fixing the gauge, some frame is chosen to yield the locally
invariant fields. We show that all the formulations, such as the Coulomb, the
axial, and the Lorentz gauges, can be constructed and that the explicit LSZ
mapping connecting Heisenberg operators to those of the asymptotic fields is
possible. We also make some comments on gauge transformations in quantized
field theory.
