<title>
The elliptic Gaudin system with spin
</title>

<abstract>
  The elliptic Gaudin model was obtained as the Hitchin system on an elliptic
curve with two fixed points. In the present paper the algebraic-geometrical
structure of the system with two fixed points is clarified. We identify this
system with poles dynamics of the finite gap solutions of Davey-Stewartson
equation. The solutions of this system in terms of theta-functions and the
action-angle variables are constructed. We also discuss the geometry of its
degenerations.
