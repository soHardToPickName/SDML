<title>
The simple scheme for the calculation of the anomalous dimensions of
  composite operators in the 1/N expansion
</title>

<abstract>
  The simple method for the calculating of the anomalous dimensions of the
composite operators up to 1/N^2 order is developed. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach by computing the critical exponents of the
$(\otimes\vec\Phi)^{s}$ and $\vec\Phi\otimes(\otimes\vec\partial)^{n}\vec\Phi$
operators in the 1/N^2 order in the nonlinear sigma model. The special
simplifications due to the conformal invariance of the model are discussed.
