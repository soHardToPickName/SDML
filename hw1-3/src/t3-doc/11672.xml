<title>
The Effective Action in Gauged Supergravity on Hyperbolic Background and
  Induced Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  The one-loop effective action for 4-dimensional gauged supergravity with
negative cosmological constant, is investigated in space-times with compact
hyperbolic spatial section. The explicit expansion of the effective action as a
power series of the curvature on hyperbolic background is derived, making use
of heat-kernel and zeta-regularization techniques. The induced cosmological and
Newton constants are computed.
