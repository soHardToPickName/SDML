<title>
Recovery of the Schwarzschild Metric in Theories with Localized Gravity
  Beyond Linear Order
</title>

<abstract>
  We solve the Einstein equations in the Randall-Sundrum framework with a
static, spherically symmetric matter distribution on the {\it physical brane}
and obtain an approximate expression for the gravitational field outside the
source to second order in the gravitational coupling. This expression when
confined on the {\it physical brane} coincides with the standard form of the
Schwarzschild metric. Therefore, the Randall-Sundrum scenario is consistent
with the Mercury precession test of General Relativity.
