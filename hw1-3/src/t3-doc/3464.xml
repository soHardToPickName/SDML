<title>
Relativistic Spin-Statistics Connection and Kaluza-Klein Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-relativistic formalism introduced by Berry and Robbins that naturally
incorporates the spin-statistics connection is generalized relativistically. It
is then extended to an arbitrary Kaluza-Klein space-time by a suitable
generalization of the Schwinger treatment of angular momenta. This leads, in
this approach, to the inclusion of the `internal' quantum numbers in the
spin-statistics connection on an equal footing with spin.
