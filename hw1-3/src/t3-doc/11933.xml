<title>
Dynamics in a noncommutative phase space
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamics has been generalized to a noncommutative phase space. The
noncommuting phase space is taken to be invariant under the quantum group
$GL_{q,p}(2)$. The $q$-deformed differential calculus on the phase space is
formulated and using this, both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian forms of
dynamics have been constructed. In contrast to earlier forms of $q$-dynamics,
our formalism has the advantage of preserving the conventional symmetries such
as rotational or Lorentz invariance.
