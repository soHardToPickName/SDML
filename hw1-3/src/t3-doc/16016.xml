The Discrete $Z_{2N_c}$ Symmetry And Effective Superpotential In SUSY
  Gluodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We find an expression for the effective superpotential describing the $N_c$
vacua of $SU(N_c)$ SUSY gluodynamics. The superpotential reduces in some
approximation to the Veneziano-Yankielowicz expression amended by the term
restoring the discrete $Z_{2N_c}$ symmetry. Moreover, the superpotential, being
restricted to one particular vacuum state, yields the expression which was
derived recently to describe all the lowest-spin physical states of the theory.
The corresponding scalar potential has no cusp singularities and can be used to
study the domain walls interpolating between the chirally asymmetric vacua of
the model.
