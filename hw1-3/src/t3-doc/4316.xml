Dibaryons, Branes, And Strings In AdS Orbifold Models
</title>

<abstract>
  A generalization of the Maldacena conjecture asserts that Type IIB string
theory on $\S^5/\Z_3$ is equivalent to a certain supersymmetric $SU(N)^3$ gauge
theory with bifundamental matter. To test this assertion, we analyze the
wrapped branes on $\S^5/\Z_3$ and their interpretation in terms of gauge
theory. The wrapped branes are interpreted in some cases as baryons or
dibaryons of the gauge theory and in other cases as strings around which there
is a global monodromy. In order to successfully match the brane analysis with
field theory, we must uncover some aspects of $S$-duality which are novel even
in the case of four-dimensional free field theory.
