<title>
Born-Infeld Kinematics and Correction to the Thomas Precession
</title>

<abstract>
  Dynamical symmetries of Born-Infeld theory associated with its maximal field
strength are encoded in a geometry on the tangent bundle of spacetime
manifolds. The resulting extension of general relativity respecting a finite
upper bound on accelerations is put to use in the discussion of particle
dynamics, first quantization, and the derivation of a correction to the Thomas
precession.
