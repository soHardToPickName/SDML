<title>
K-Theory, Reality, and Orientifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We use equivariant K-theory to classify charges of new (possibly
non-supersymmetric) states localized on various orientifolds in Type II string
theory. We also comment on the stringy construction of new D-branes and
demonstrate the discrete electric-magnetic duality in Type I brane systems with
p+q=7, as proposed by Witten.
