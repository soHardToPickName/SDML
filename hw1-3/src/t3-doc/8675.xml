<title>
Topologically nontrivial field configurations in noncommutative geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of noncommutative geometry we describe spinor fields with
nonvanishing winding number on a truncated (fuzzy) sphere. The corresponding
field theory actions conserve all basic symmetries of the standard commutative
version (space isometries and global chiral symmetry), but due to the
noncommutativity of the space the fields are regularized and they contain only
finite number of modes.
