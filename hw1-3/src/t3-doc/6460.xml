<title>
Lattice Gauge Theories and the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  This is the write-up of a set of lectures on the comparison between Lattice
Gauge Theories and AdS/CFT results for the non-perturbative behaviour of
non-supersymmetric Yang Mills theories. These notes are intended for students
which are assumed not to be experts in L.G.T. For this reason the first part is
devoted to a pedagogical introduction to the Lattice regularization of QCD. In
the second part we discuss some basic features of the AdS/CFT correspondence
and compare the results obtained in the non-supersymmetric limit with those
obtained on the Lattice. We discuss in particular the behaviour of the string
tension and of the glueball spectrum. Lectures delivered at the School of
Theoretical Physics (S.N.F.T.), Parma, September 1999.
