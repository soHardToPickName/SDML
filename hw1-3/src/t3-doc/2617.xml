N=2 Superfields and the M-Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we provide a manifestly N=2 supersymmetric formulation of the
M-fivebrane in the presence of threebrane solitons. The superspace form of
four-dimensional effective equations for the threebranes are readily obtained
and yield the complete Seiberg-Witten equations of motion for N=2
super-Yang-Mills. A particularly simple derivation is given by introducing an
N=2 superfield generalisation of the Seiberg-Witten differential.
