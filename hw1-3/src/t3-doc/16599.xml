<title>
Superstrings from Hamiltonian Reduction
</title>

<abstract>
  In any string theory there is a hidden, twisted superconformal symmetry
algebra, part of which is made up by the BRST current and the anti-ghost. We
investigate how this algebra can be systematically constructed for strings with
$N\!-\!2$ supersymmetries, via quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the Lie
superalgebras $osp(N|2)$. The motivation is to understand how one could
systematically construct generalized string theories from superalgebras. We
also briefly discuss the BRST algebra of the topological string, which is a
doubly twisted $N\!=\!4$ superconformal algebra.
