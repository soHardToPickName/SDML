Duality equivalence between nonlinear self-dual and topologically
  massive models
</title>

<abstract>
  In this report we study the dual equivalence between the generalized
self-dual (SD) and topologically massive (TM) models. To this end we linearize
the model using an auxiliary field and apply a gauge embedding procedure to
construct a gauge equivalent model. We clearly show that, under the above
conditions, a nonlinear SD model always has a duality equivalent TM action.The
general result obtained is then particularized for a number of examples,
including the Born-Infeld-Chern-Simons (BICS) model recently discussed in the
literature.
