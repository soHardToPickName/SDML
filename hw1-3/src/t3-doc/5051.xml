<title>
Representations and Q-Boson Realization of the Algebra of Functions on
  the Quantum Group GLq(N)
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a detailed study of the representations of the algebra of
functions on the quantum group $ GL_q(n) $. A q-analouge of the root system is
constructed for this algebra which is then used to determine explicit matrix
representations of the generators of this algebra. At the end a q-boson
realization of the generators of $ GL_q(n) $ is given.
