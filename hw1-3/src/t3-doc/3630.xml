A Universal Action Formula
</title>

<abstract>
  A universal formula for an action associated with a noncommutative geometry,
defined by a spectal triple $(\Ac ,\Hc ,D)$, is proposed. It is based on the
spectrum of the Dirac operator and is a geometric invariant. The new symmetry
principle is the automorphism of the algebra $\Ac $ which combines both
diffeomorphisms and internal symmetries. Applying this to the geometry defined
by the spectrum of the standard model gives an action that unifies gravity with
the standard model at a very high energy scale.
