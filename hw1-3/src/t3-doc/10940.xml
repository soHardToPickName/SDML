Solvable Confining Gauge Theories at Large N
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we consider models with N U(1) gauge fields together with N
Kalb-Ramond fields in the large N limit. These models can be solved explicitely
and exhibit confinement for a large class of bare actions. The confining phase
is characterized by an approximate "low energy" vector gauge symmetry under
which the Kalb-Ramond fields transform. A duality transformation shows that
confinement is associated with magnetic monopoles condensation.
