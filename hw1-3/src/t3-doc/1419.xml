Discrete Gauge States and$w_\infty$ Charges in c=1 2d Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a general formula for gauge states at the discrete momenta in
Liouville theory. These discrete gauge states carry the $w_\infty$ charges. As
in the case of the 26D (or 10D) string theory, they are decoupled from the
correlation functions and can be considered as the symmetry parameters in the
old covariant quantization of the theory.
