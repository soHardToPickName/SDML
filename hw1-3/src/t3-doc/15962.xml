Cosmological Spinning Multi-`Black-Hole' Solution in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a cosmological spinning multi-`black-hole' solution in the
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory with a positive cosmological constant.
This solution is the cosmological dilatonic Israel-Wilson-Perjes solution and
describes the collision of several spinning `black-holes'.
