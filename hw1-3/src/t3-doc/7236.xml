<title>
Euclidean field theory and singular classical field configurations
</title>

<abstract>
  Euclidean field theory on 4-dimensional sphere is suggested for the study of
high energy multiparticle production. The singular classical field
configurations are found in scalar and SU(2)-gauge theories and the cross
section of 2->n processes is calculated. It is shown,that the cross section has
a maximum at the energy compared to the sphaleron mass.
