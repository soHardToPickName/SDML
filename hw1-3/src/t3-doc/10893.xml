Lagrangian Formulation of Symmetric Space sine-Gordon Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The symmetric space sine-Gordon models arise by conformal reduction of
ordinary 2-dim $\sigma$-models, and they are integrable exhibiting a black-hole
type metric in target space. We provide a Lagrangian formulation of these
systems by considering a triplet of Lie groups $F \supset G \supset H$. We show
that for every symmetric space $F/G$, the generalized sine-Gordon models can be
derived from the $G/H$ WZW action, plus a potential term that is algebraically
specified. Thus, the symmetric space sine-Gordon models describe certain
integrable perturbations of coset conformal field theories at the classical
level. We also briefly discuss their vacuum structure, Backlund
transformations, and soliton solutions.
