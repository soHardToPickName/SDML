On the Schr\"odinger Equation for the Supersymmetric FRW Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) model. We show that for this purpose it is
possible to include an additional action invariant under reparametrization of
time. The last one does not change the equations of motion for the
minisuperspace model, but changes only the constraint. The same procedure is
applied to the supersymmetric case.
