<title>
Bosonization and even Grassmann variables
</title>

<abstract>
  A new approach to bosonization in relativistic field theories and many-body
systems, based on the use of fermionic composites as integration variables in
the Berezin integral defining the partition function of the system, is tested.
The method is applied to the study of a simplified version of the BCS model.
