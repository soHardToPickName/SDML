Supersymmetry with a Ghost Time
</title>

<abstract>
  The progress brought to the study of chiral fermions and gauge theories by
quantization methods with a bulk time suggests their usefulness in
supersymmetric theories. Using superspace methods, we show how an explicitly
supersymmetric version of such quantization methods may be given.
