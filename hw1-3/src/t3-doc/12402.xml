Light-cone Superstring in AdS Space-time
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider fixing the bosonic light-cone gauge for string in AdS in the
phase space framework, i.e. by choosing $x^+ = \tau$, and by choosing $\sigma$
so that $P^+$ is distributed uniformly (its density is independent of
$\sigma$). We discuss classical bosonic string in AdS space and superstring in
AdS_5 x S^5. In the latter case the starting point is the action found in
hep-th/0007036 where the kappa-symmetry is fixed by a fermionic light cone
gauge. We derive the light cone Hamiltonian in the AdS_5 x S^5 case and in the
case of superstring in AdS_3 x S^3. We also obtain a realization of the
generators of the basic symmetry superalgebra psu(2,2|4) in terms of the AdS_5
x S^5 superstring coordinate fields.
