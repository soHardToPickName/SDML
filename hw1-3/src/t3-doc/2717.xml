SUSY N=2 hyperelliptic curve from N=1 effective potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the singularity conditions of the N=1 generalized (general yukawa
couplings and quark masses) form of hyperelliptic curves of SU(N_c) with N_f
flavors. The results reproduce the known form of N=2 curves when the yukawa
couplings and the quark masses reduce to those of N=2. We obtained these curves
by determining the dependence of the unbroken SU(2) gaugino condensation on the
couplings in the moduli source terms which break N=2 SQCD to N=1 SU(N_c) gauge
theory with the quarks and the adjoint matter, \Phi. The degenerate component
of the diagonalized classical vacuum expectation value of \Phi is shown to be
explicitly written in terms of these couplings, which enables us to determine
the form of the gaugino condensation.
