On osp(2|2) conformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the conformal field theories corresponding to current superalgebras
$osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ and $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$. We construct the free field
realizations, screen currents and primary fields of these current superalgebras
at general level $k$. All the results for $osp(2|2)^{(2)}_k$ are new, and the
results for the primary fields of $osp(2|2)^{(1)}_k$ also seem to be new. Our
results are expected to be useful in the supersymmetric approach to Gaussian
disordered systems such as random bond Ising model and Dirac model.
