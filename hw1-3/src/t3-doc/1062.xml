Flow Equations for U_k and Z_k
</title>

<abstract>
  By considering the gradient expansion for the wilsonian effective action S_k
of a single component scalar field theory truncated to the first two terms, the
potential U_k and the kinetic term Z_k, I show that the recent claim that
different expansion of the fluctuation determinant give rise to different
renormalization group equations for Z_k is incorrect. The correct procedure to
derive this equation is presented and the set of coupled differential equations
for U_k and Z_k is definitely established.
