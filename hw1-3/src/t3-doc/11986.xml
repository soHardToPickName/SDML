<title>
Effective actions, relative cohomology and Chern Simons forms
</title>

<abstract>
  The explicit expression of all the WZW effective actions for a simple group G
broken down to a subgroup H is established in a simple and direct way, and the
formal similarity of these actions to the Chern-Simons forms is explained.
Applications are also discussed.
