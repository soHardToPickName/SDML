Self-Similar Potentials and q-Coherent States
</title>

<abstract>
  The self-similar potentials are formulated in terms of the shape-invariance.
Based on it, a coherent state associated with the shape-invariant potentials is
calculated in case of the self-similar potentials. It is shown that it reduces
to the q-deformed coherent state.
