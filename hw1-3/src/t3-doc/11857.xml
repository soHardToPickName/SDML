Coloured Black Holes in Higher Curvature String Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the combined Yang Mills-Dilaton-Gravity system in the presence of
a Gauss-Bonnet term as it appears in the $4D$ Effective Superstring Action. We
give analytical arguments and demonstrate numerically the existence of black
hole solutions with non-trivial dilaton and Yang Mills hair for the particular
case of SU(2) gauge fields. The thermodynamical properties of the solutions are
also discussed.
