Lectures on string/brane cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview is presented of some cosmological aspects of string theory.
Recent developments are emphasised, especially the attempts to derive inflation
or alternatives to inflation from the dynamics of branes in string theory. Time
dependent backgrounds with potential cosmological implications, such as those
provided by negative tension branes and S-branes and the rolling string tachyon
are also discussed.
