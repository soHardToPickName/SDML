$C_2$ Toda theory in the reduced WZNW framework
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the $C_2$ Toda theory in the reduced WZNW framework. Analysing
the classical representation space of the symmetry algebra (which is the
corresponding $C_2$ $W$ algebra) we determine its classical highest weight
representations. We quantise the model promoting only the relevant quantities
to operators. Using the quantised equation of motion we determine the selection
rules for the $u$ field that corresponds to one of the Toda fields and give
restrictions for its amplitude functions and for the structure of the Hilbert
space of the model.
