Static Solution in Source-Free SU(2) Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a non-trivial topological effect breaks the conformal invariance
of pure Yang-Mills theory. Thus it is possible that classic particle-like
solutions exists in pure non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory. We find a static,
non-singular solution in source-free SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in
four-dimensional Minkowski space. This solution is a stable soliton
characterized by non-trivial topology and imaginary $A_0^a$, i.e.,
$A_0^aA_0^a<0$. It yields hermitian Hamilton, and finite, positive energy.
