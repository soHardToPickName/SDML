<title>
On the Liouville coupling constants
</title>

<abstract>
  For the general operator product algebra coefficients derived by Cremmer
Roussel Schnittger and the present author with (positive integer)
screening numbers, the coupling constants determine the factors additional to
the quantum group 6j symbols.
  They are given by path independent products over a two dimensional lattice in
the zero mode space. It is shown that the ansatz for the three point function
of Dorn-Otto and Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov precisely defines the
corresponding flat lattice connection, so that it does give a natural
generalization of these coupling constants to continuous screening numbers. The
consistency of the restriction to integer screening charges is reviewed, and
shown to be linked with the orthogonality of the (generalized) 6j symbols. Thus
extending this last relation is the key to general screening numbers.
