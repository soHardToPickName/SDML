<title>
The symmetry structure of the anti-self-dual Einstein hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  An important example of a multi-dimensional integrable system is the
anti-self-dual Einstein equations. By studying the symmetries of these
equations, a recursion operator is found and the associated hierarchy
constructed. Owing to the properties of the recursion operator one may
construct a hierarchy of symmetries and find the algebra generated by them. In
addition, the Lax pair for this hierarchy is constructed.
