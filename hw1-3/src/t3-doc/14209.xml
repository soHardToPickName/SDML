<title>
The asymptotic symmetry of de Sitter spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to construct a set of Euclidean conformal correlation functions
on the boundary of a de Sitter space from an interacting bulk quantum field
theory with a certain asymptotic behaviour. We discuss the status of the
boundary theory w.r.t. the reflection positivity and conclude that no obvious
physical holographic interpretation is available.
