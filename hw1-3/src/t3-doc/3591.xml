Gauge Theories in the Momentum/Curvature Representation
</title>

<abstract>
  The gauge variance of wave functionals for a gauge theory quantized in the
momentum (curvature) representation is described. It is shown that a gauge
transformation gives rise to a cocycle, which for theories in two space-time
dimensions is related to the Kirillov-Kostant form. Various derivations are
presented, including one based on geometric (pre-) quantization. The formalism
is applied to two dimensional gravity models that are equivalently described by
"B-F" gauge theories.
