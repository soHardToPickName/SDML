<title>
A Generalized ``Surfaceless'' Stokes' Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive a generalized Stokes' theorem, valid in any dimension and for
arbitrary loops, even if self intersecting or knotted. The generalized theorem
does not involve an auxiliary surface, but inherits a higher rank gauge
symmetry from the invariance under deformations of the surface used in the
conventional formulation.
