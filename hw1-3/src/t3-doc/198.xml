<title>
Skyrmions and domain walls
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the 3+1 dimensional Skyrme model with a mass term different from the
usual one. We show that this new model possesses domain walls solutions. We
describe how, in the equivalent 2+1 dimensional model, the Skyrmion is absorbed
by the wall.
