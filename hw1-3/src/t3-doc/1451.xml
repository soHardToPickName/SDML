<title>
The weakly disordered 2D electron gas in a magnetic field
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a relativistic two-dimensional free electron gas in the presence of
a uniform external magnetic field and a random static scalar potential. We
compute the expectation values of the charge density and the conductivity
tensor, averaged over the random potential in first order perturbation theory.
We discuss the effect of a zero vs. finite range correlation length of the
random potential.
