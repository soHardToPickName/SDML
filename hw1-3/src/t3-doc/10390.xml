<title>
Evaluation of Casimir energies through spectral functions
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an introductory set of lectures on elliptic differential operators
and boundary problems, and their associated spectral functions. The role of
zeta functions and traces of heat kernels in the regularization of Casimir
energies is emphasized, and the renormalization issue is discussed through
simple examples.
