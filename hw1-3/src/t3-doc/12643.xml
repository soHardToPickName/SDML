<title>
Unitarity of supersymmetric SL(2,R)/U(1) and no-ghost theorem for
  fermionic strings in AdS(3) x N
</title>

<abstract>
  The unitarity of the NS supersymmetric coset SL(2,R)/U(1) is studied for the
discrete representations. The results are applied to the proof of the no-ghost
theorem for fermionic strings in AdS(3) x N in the NS sector. A no-ghost
theorem is proved for states in flowed discrete representations.
