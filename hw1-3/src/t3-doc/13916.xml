<title>
Integrability and Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The theory of matrix models is reviewed from the point of view of its
relation to integrable hierarchies. Discrete 1-matrix, 2-matrix, ``conformal''
(multicomponent) and Kontsevich models are considered in some detail, together
with the Ward identites (``W-constraints''), determinantal formulas and
continuum limits, taking one kind of models into another. Subtle points and
directions of the future research are also discussed.
