The Exact Tachyon Beta-Function for the Wess-Zumino-Witten Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive an exact expression for the tachyon $\beta$-function for the
Wess-Zumino-Witten model. We check our result up to three loops by calculating
the three-loop tachyon $\beta$-function for a general non-linear $\sigma$-model
with torsion, and then specialising to the case of the WZW model.
