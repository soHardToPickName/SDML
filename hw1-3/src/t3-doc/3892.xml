<title>
Noncommutative Geometry and Gauge Theories on Discrete Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We build and investigate a pure gauge theory on arbitrary discrete groups. A
systematic approach to the construction of the differential calculus is
presented. We discuss the metric properties of the models and introduce the
action functionals for unitary gauge theories. A detailed analysis of two
simple models based on $\z_2$ and $\z_3$ follows. Finally we study the method
of combining the discrete and continuous geometry.
