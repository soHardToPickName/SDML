<title>
Schwinger's formula and the partition function for the bosonic and
  fermionic harmonic oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  We use Schwinger's formula, introduced by himself in the early fifties to
compute effective actions for QED, and recently applied to the Casimir effect,
to obtain the partition functions for both the bosonic and fermionic harmonic
oscillator.
