Open Inflation Without False Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that within the framework of a definite proposal for the initial
conditions for the universe, the Hartle-Hawking `no boundary' proposal, open
inflation is generic and does not require any special properties of the
inflaton potential. In the simplest inflationary models, the semiclassical
approximation to the Euclidean path integral and a minimal anthropic condition
lead to $\Omega_0\approx 0.01$. This number may be increased in models with
more fields or extra dimensions.
