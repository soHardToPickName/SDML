<title>
Bose-Einstein condensation for interacting scalar fields in curved
  spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
We consider the model of self-interacting complex scalar fields with a rigid
gauge invariance under an arbitrary gauge group $G$. In order to analyze the
phenomenon of Bose-Einstein condensation finite temperature and the possibility
of a finite background charge is included. Different approaches to derive the
relevant high-temperature behaviour of the theory are presented.
