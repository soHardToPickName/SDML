Four-Dimensional Supergravities from Five-Dimensional Brane Worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the explicit form of the four dimensional effective supergravity
action, which describes low energy physics of the Randall-Sundrum model with
moduli fields in the bulk and charged chiral matter living on the branes. The
relation between 5d and 4d physics is explicit: the low energy action is
derived from the compactification of a locally supersymmetric model in five
dimension. The presence of odd $Z_2$ parity scalars in the bulk gives rise to
effective potential for the radion in four dimensions. We describe the
mechanism of supersymmetry breaking mediation, which relies on non-trivial
configuration of these $Z_2$-odd bulk fields. Broken supersymmetry leads to
stabilization of the interbrane distance.
