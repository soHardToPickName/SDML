<title>
Heterotic String Theory with Background Fluxes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss compactifications of the heterotic string in the presence of
background fluxes. Specifically we consider compactifications on T^6, T^5, K3 x
T^2 and K3 x S^1 for which we derive the bosonic sector of the low energy
effective action. The consistency with the corresponding gauged supergravities
is demonstrated.
