<title>
Mass and Decay Spectra of the Piecewise Uniform String
</title>

<abstract>
  Mass and decay spectra are calculated for quantum massive excitations of a
piecewise uniform bosonic string. The physical meaning of the critical
temperatures characterizing the radiation in the decay of a massive microstate
in string theory is discussed.
