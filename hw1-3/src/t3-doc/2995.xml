N=2 Curves and a Coulomb Phase in N=1 SUSY Gauge Theories with Adjoint
  and Fundamental Matters
</title>

<abstract>
  We study low-energy effective superpotentials for the phase with a confined
photon in N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories with an adjoint matter $\Phi$ and
fundamental flavors $Q, \tilde Q$. Arbitrary classical gauge groups are
considered. The results are used to derive the hyperelliptic curves which
describe the Coulomb phase of N=2 supersymmetric QCD with classical gauge
groups. These curves are in agreement with those proposed earlier by several
authors. Our results also produce the curves relevant to describe the Coulomb
phase of N=1 theories with a superpotential of the form $\tilde{Q} \Phi^{l} Q$.
