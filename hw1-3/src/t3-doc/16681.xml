<title>
Two-dimensional anyons and the temperature dependence of commutator
  anomalies
</title>

<abstract>
  The temperature dependence of commutator anomalies is discussed on the
explicit example of particular (anyonic) field operators in two dimensions. The
correlation functions obtained show that effects of the non-zero temperature
might manifest themselves not only globally but also locally.
