Spontaneous Breaking of N=2 Global Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in N=2 globally supersymmetric
theories describing a system of abelian vector multiplets. We find that the
most general form of the action admits, in addition to the usual
Fayet-Iliopoulos term, a magnetic Fayet-Iliopoulos term for the auxiliary
components of dual vector multiplets. In a generic case, N=2 supersymmetry is
broken down spontaneously to N=1. In some cases however, the scalar potential
can drive the theory towards a N=2 supersymmetric ground state where massless
dyons condense in the vacuum.
