Current algebra and exotic statistics in 6 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  By studying ordinary chiral fermions in background gauge fields we show that
in the case of gauge group SU(3) and space-time dimension 5+1 localized
solitons obey $q-$ commutation relations with $q$ not equal to $\pm 1$ but a
third root of unity.
