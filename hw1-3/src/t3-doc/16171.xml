Quasinormal Modes of Near Extremal Black Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We find quasinormal modes of near extremal black branes by solving a singular
boundary value problem for the Heun equation. The corresponding eigenvalues
determine the dispersion law for the collective excitations in the dual
strongly coupled N=4 SYM at finite temperature.
