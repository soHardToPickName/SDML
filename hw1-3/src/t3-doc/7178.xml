On the $W$-algebra in the Calegero-Sutherland model using the Exchange
  operators
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the $W_\infty$ algebra in the Calegero-Sutherland model using the
exchange operators. The presence of all the sub-algebras of $W_\infty$ is shown
in this model. A simplified proof for this algebra, in the symmetric ordered
basics, is given. It is pointed out that the algebra contains in general,
nonlinear terms. Possible connection to the nonlinear $W_\infty$ is discussed.
