Gauged N=4 Supergravity through Compactification and BPS Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that N=4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions is obtained by
compactifying N=1 supergravity in ten dimensions on the group manifold
$S^3\times S^3$. This could be further related to supergravity in eleven
dimensions. Analysis of supersymmetry conditions of N=4 gauged supergravity in
four dimensions reveals solutions which preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetries and
are characterized by a BPS-monopole-type gauge field. These solutions are
lifted to solutions of the ten and eleven dimensional theories.
