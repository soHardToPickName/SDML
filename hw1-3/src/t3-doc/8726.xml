A Note on Effective String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Motivated by the possibility of an effective string description for the
infrared limit of pure Yang-Mills theory, we present a toy model for an
effective theory of random surfaces propagating in a target space of $D>2$. We
show that the scaling exponents for the fixed area partition function of the
theory are apparently well behaved. We make some observations regarding the
usefulness of this toy model.
