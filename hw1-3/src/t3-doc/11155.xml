Duality and Instantons in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In these lecture notes duality tests and instanton effects in supersymmetric
vacua of string theory are discussed.
 A broad overview of BPS-saturated terms in the effective actions is first
given. Their role in testing the consistency of duality conjectures as well as
discovering the rules of instanton calculus in string theory is discussed. The
example of heterotic/type-I duality is treated in detail. Thresholds of F^4 and
R^4 terms are used to test the duality as well as to derive rules for
calculated with D1-brane instantons. We further consider the case of R^2
couplings in N=4 ground-states. Heterotic/type II duality is invoked to predict
the heterotic NS5-brane instanton corrections to the R^2 threshold. The R^4
couplings of type-II string theory with maximal supersymmetry are also analysed
and the D-instanton contributions are described Other applications and open
problems are sketched.
