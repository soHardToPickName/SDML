Massive IIA Supergravity as a Non-linear Realisation
</title>

<abstract>
  A description of the bosonic sector of massive IIA supergravity as a
non-linear realisation is given. An essential feature of this construction is
that the momentum generators have non-trivial commutation relations with the
generators associated with the gauge fields.
