Observational Tests of Instanton Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  A new cosmological model leads to testable predictions that are different
from those of both standard cosmology and models with a cosmological constant.
The prediction that q_0=0 is the same as in other ``coasting universe'' models,
but arises without the need for any exotic form of matter or other ad hoc
assumptions.
