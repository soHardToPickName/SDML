The superfluidity of fermions coupled to gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate superfluidity of the relativistic fermi-gas with gravitational
interaction. The excitation spectrum is obtained within the linearized theory.
While superfluidity may take place at a definite ratio of the Fermi momentum,
rest mass and coupling constant, the metric coefficients play predominant role
forming the gap of excitation spectrum.
