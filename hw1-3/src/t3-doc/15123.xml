<title>
String Duality and Modular Forms
</title>

<abstract>
  Tests of duality between heterotic strings on $K3\times T^2$ (restricted on
certain Narain moduli subspaces) and type IIA strings on K3-fibered
Calabi-Yau threefolds are attempted in the weak coupling regime on the
heterotic side by identifying pertinent modular forms related to the
computations of string threshold corrections. Concretely we discuss in
parallel the three cases associated with Calabi-Yau manifolds
$(A):X(6,2,2,1,1)_{2}^{-252}$, $(B):X(12,8,2,1,1)_{3}^{-480}$ and
$(C):X(10,3,3,2,2)_{4}^{-132}$ on the type IIA side.
