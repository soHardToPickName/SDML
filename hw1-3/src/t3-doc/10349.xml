<title>
Projective resolutions of coherent sheaves and descent relations between
  branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We notice that, for branes wrapped on complex analytic subvarieties, the
algebraic-geometric version of K-theory makes the identification between
brane-antibrane pairs and lower-dimensional branes automatic. This is because
coherent sheaves on the ambient variety represent gauge bundles on
subvarieties, and they can be put in exact sequences (projective resolutions)
with sheaves corresponding to vector bundles on the pair; this automatically
gives a D(p-2) as a formal difference of bundles on the Dp - D\bar p pair, both
belonging to the Grothendieck group of coherent sheaves of the ambient.
