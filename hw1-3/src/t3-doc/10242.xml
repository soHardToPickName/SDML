<title>
Gravitational Interactions of integrable models
</title>

<abstract>
  We couple non-linear $\sigma$-models to Liouville gravity, showing that
integrability properties of symmetric space models still hold for the matter
sector. Using similar arguments for the fermionic counterpart, namely
Gross--Neveu-type models, we verify that such conclusions must also hold for
them, as recently suggested.
