<title>
On the classical $\kappa$-particle
</title>

<abstract>
  The dependence of velocity on momentum for the free massive particle obeying
the $\kappa $-Poincar\'{e} Poisson symmetry is calculated in terms of intrinsic
non-commuting space-time coordinates and shown to have a monotonic character,
with upper limit of velocity equal to 1.
