<title>
Multimomentum Hamiltonian Formalism in Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The familiar generating functionals in quantum field theory fail to be true
measures and, so they make the sense only in the framework of the perturbation
theory. In our approach, generating functionals are defined strictly as the
Fourier transforms of Gaussian measures in nuclear spaces of multimomentum
canonical variables when field momenta correspond to derivatives of fields with
respect to all world coordinates, not only to time.
