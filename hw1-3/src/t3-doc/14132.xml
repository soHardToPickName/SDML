Equivalence Postulate and the Quantum Potential of Two Free Particles
</title>

<abstract>
  Commutativity of the diagram of the maps connecting three one--particle
state, implied by the Equivalence Postulate (EP), gives a cocycle condition
which unequivocally leads to the quantum Hamilton--Jacobi equation. Energy
quantization is a direct consequences of the local homeomorphicity of the
trivializing map. We review the EP and show that the quantum potential for two
free particles, which depends on constants which may have a geometrical
interpretation, plays the role of interaction term that admits solutions which
do not vanish in the classical limit.
