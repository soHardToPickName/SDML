Gravitational Couplings for y-Gop-Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  The Wess-Zumino action for y deformed and generalized orientifold planes
(yGOp-planes) is presented and one power expantion is realized from which
processes that involves yGOp-planes, RR-forms, gravitons and gaugeons, are
obtained. Finally non-standard yGOp-planes are showed.
