Kaehler forms and cosmological solutions in type II supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider cosmological solutions to type II supergravity theories where the
spacetime is split into a FRW universe and a K\"ahler space, which may be taken
to be Calabi-Yau. The various 2-forms present in the theories are taken to be
proportional to the K\"ahler form associated to the K\"ahler space.
