Boundary One-Point Functions, Scattering Theory and Vacuum Solutions in
  Integrable Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Integrable boundary Toda theories are considered. We use boundary one-point
functions and boundary scattering theory to construct the explicit solutions
corresponding to classical vacuum configurations. The boundary ground state
energies are conjectured.
