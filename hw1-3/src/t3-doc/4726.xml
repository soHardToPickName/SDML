<title>
Diagrams of Noncommutative Phi-Three Theory from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from tree and one-loop tachyon amplitudes of open string theory in
the presence of a constant B-field, we explore two problems. First we show that
in the noncommutative field theory limit the amplitudes reduce to tree and
one-loop diagrams of the noncommutative phi-three theory. Next, we check
factorization of the one-loop amplitudes in the long cylinder limit.
