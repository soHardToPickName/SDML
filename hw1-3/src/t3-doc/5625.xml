<title>
Novel Phase Structure of Twisted O(N) phi^4 model on M^D-1 \times S^1
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the O(N) $\phi^4$ model compactified on $M^{D-1}\otimes S^1$, which
allows to impose twisted boundary conditions for the $S^1$-direction. The O(N)
symmetry can be broken to $H$ explicitly by the boundary conditions and further
broken to $I$ spontaneously by vacuum expectation values of the fields. The
symmetries $H$ and $I$ are completely classified and the model turns out to
have unexpectedly a rich phase structure. The unbroken symmetry $I$ is shown to
depend on not only the boundary conditions but also the radius of $S^1$, and
the symmetry breaking patterns are found to be unconventional. The spontaneous
breakdown of the translational invariance is also discussed.
