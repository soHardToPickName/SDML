Deep Inelastic Scattering and Gauge/String Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We study deep inelastic scattering in gauge theories which have dual string
descriptions. As a function of $gN$ we find a transition. For small $gN$, the
dominant operators in the OPE are the usual ones, of approximate twist two,
corresponding to scattering from weakly interacting partons. For large $gN$,
double-trace operators dominate, corresponding to scattering from entire
hadrons (either the original `valence' hadron or part of a hadron cloud.) At
large $gN$ we calculate the structure functions. As a function of Bjorken $x$
there are three regimes: $x$ of order one, where the scattering produces only
supergravity states; $x$ small, where excited strings are produced; and, $x$
exponentially small, where the excited strings are comparable in size to the
AdS space. The last regime requires in principle a full string calculation in
curved spacetime, but the effect of string growth can be simply obtained from
the world-sheet renormalization group.
