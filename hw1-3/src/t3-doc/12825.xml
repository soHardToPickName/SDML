Covariant Duality Symmetric Actions
</title>

<abstract>
  A manifestly Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariant form for the abelian gauge
field action with local duality symmetry of Schwarz and Sen is given. Some of
the underlying symmetries of the covariant action are further considered. The
Noether conserved charge under continuous local duality rotations is found. The
covariant couplings with gravity and the axidilaton field are discussed.
