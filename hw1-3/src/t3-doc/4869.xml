<title>
Kahler Normal Coordinate Expansion in Supersymmetric Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The Riemann normal coordinate expansion method is generalized to a Kahler
manifold. The Kahler potential and holomorphic coordinate transformations are
used to define a normal coordinate preserving the complex structure. The
existence of this Kahler normal coordinate is shown explicitly to all orders.
The formalism is applied to background field methods in supersymmetric
nonlinear sigma models.
