<title>
Dirac Operator Spectra from Finite-Volume Partition Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the relation to random matrix theory, exact expressions for all
microscopic spectral correlators of the Dirac operator can be computed from
finite-volume partition functions. This is illustrated for the case of
$SU(N_c)$ gauge theories with $N_c\geq 3$ and $N_f$ fermions in the fundamental
representation.
