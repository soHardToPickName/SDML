Notes on Multi-Trace Operators and Holographic Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the Holographic Renormalization Group can be formulated
universally within Quantum Field Theory as (the quantization of) the
Hamiltonian flow on the cotangent bundle to the space of gauge-invariant
single-trace operators supplied with the canonical symplectic structure. The
classical Hamiltonian dynamics is recovered in the large $N$ limit.
