String-Motivated Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-dimensional model which emerges from low-energy considerations of
string theory is written down. Solutions of this classical model are noted,
including some examples which have nontrivial tachyon field. One such
represents the classical backreaction of the tachyon field on the black hole
for a two parameter set of tachyon potentials. Assuming the classical black
hole background in the `Eddington-Finkelstein' gauge, the tachyon equation is
separable and the radial part is solved by a hypergeometric function, which is
in general of complex argument. A semi-classical prescription for including the
quantum effects of the tachyon field is described, and the resulting equations
of motion are found. Special solutions of these equations are written down.
