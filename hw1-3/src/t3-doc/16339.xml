<title>
Sphaleron in the dilatonic electroweak theory
</title>

<abstract>
  A numerical study of static, spherically symmetric sphaleron solutions in the
standard model coupled to the dilaton field is presented. We show that
sphaleron is surrounded by strong dilaton cloud which vanishes inside the
sphaleron.
