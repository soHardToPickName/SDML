<title>
Hawking radiation on a falling lattice
</title>

<abstract>
  Scalar field theory on a lattice falling freely into a 1+1 dimensional black
hole is studied using both WKB and numerical approaches. The outgoing modes are
shown to arise from incoming modes by a process analogous to a Bloch
oscillation, with an admixture of negative frequency modes corresponding to the
Hawking radiation. Numerical calculations show that the Hawking effect is
reproduced to within 0.5% on a lattice whose proper spacing where the
wavepacket turns around at the horizon is $\sim0.08$ in units where the surface
gravity is 1.
