Exact Answers to Approximate Questions: Noncommutative Dipoles, Open
  Wilson Lines, and UV-IR Duality
</title>

<abstract>
  In this lecture, I put forward conjectures asserting that, in all
noncommutative field theories, (1) open Wilson lines and their descendants
constitute a complete set of interpolating operators of `noncommutative
dipoles', obeying dipole relation, (2) infrared dynamics of the noncommutative
dipoles is dual to ultraviolet dynamics of the elementary noncommutative
fields, and (3) open string field theory is a sort of noncommutative field
theory, whose open Wilson lines are interpolating operators for closed strings.
I substantiate these conjectures by various intuitive arguments and explicit
computations of one- and two-loop Feynman diagrammatics.
