Electric-Magnetic Duality in QED Effective Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently we have obtained a non-perturbative but convergent series expression
of the one loop effective action of QED, and discussed the renormalization of
the effective action. In this paper we establish the electric-magnetic duality
in the quantum effective action.
