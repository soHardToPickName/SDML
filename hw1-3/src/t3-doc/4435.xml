<title>
Matrix Models and One Dimensional Open String Theory (Revised)
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a random matrix model as a representation for $D=1$ open strings.
We show that the model is equivalent to $N$ fermions with spin in a central
potential that also includes a long-range ferromagnetic interaction between the
fermions that falls off as $1/(r_{ij})^2$. We find two interesting scaling
limits and calculate the free energy for both situations. One limit corresponds
to Dirichlet boundary conditions for the dual graphs and the other corresponds
to Neumann conditions. We compute the boundary cosmological constant and show
that it is of order $1/\log(\beta)$. We also briefly discuss a possible analog
of the Das-Jevicki field for the open string tachyon. (n.b. This is a revised
version of paper previously submitted to xxx@lanl.gov. The original version
misidentified the Dirichlet and Neumann cases. This version also includes
references to work by Yang that was missing in the original.)
