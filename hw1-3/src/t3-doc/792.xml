Charges, Monopoles and Duality Relations
</title>

<abstract>
  A charge-monopole theory is derived from simple and self-evident postulates.
Charges and monopoles take an analogous theoretical structure. It is proved
that charges interact with free waves emitted from monopoles but not with the
corresponding velocity fields. Analogous relations hold for monopole equations
of motion. The system's equations of motion can be derived from a regular
Lagrangian function.
