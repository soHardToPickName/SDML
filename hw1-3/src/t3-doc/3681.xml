A Note on the Quadratic Divergence in Hybrid Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the quadratic divergence of the Yang-Mills theory when we use the
hybrid regularization method consisting of the higher covariant derivative
terms and the Pauli-Villars fields. By the explicit calculation of the
diagrams, we show that the higher derivative terms for the ghost fields are
necessary for the complete cancellation of the quadratic divergence.
