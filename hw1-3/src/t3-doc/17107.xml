CHIRAL SYMMETRIES OF THE WZNW MODEL BY HAMILTONIAN METHODS
</title>

<abstract>
  The connection between the Kac-Moody algebras of currents and the chiral
symmetries of the two dimensional WZNW model is clarified. It is shown that
only the zero modes of the Kac-Moody currents are the first class constraints,
and that, consequently, the corresponding gauge symmetries are chiral.
