<title>
Action Principle for the Classical Dual Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The purpose of this paper is to formulate an action principle which allows
for the construction of a classical lagrangean including both electric and
magnetic currents. The lagrangean is non-local and shown to yield all the
expected (local) equations for dual electrodynamics.
