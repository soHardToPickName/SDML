<title>
Exact BRS Symmetry realized on the Renormalization Group Flow
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the average action defined with a continuum analog of the block spin
transformation, we show the presence of gauge symmetry along the Wilsonian
renormalization group flow. As a reflection of the gauge symmetry, the average
action satisfies the quantum master equation(QME). We show that the quantum
part of the master equation is naturally understood once the measure
contribution under the BRS transformation is taken into account. Furthermore an
effective BRS transformation acting on macroscopic fields may be defined from
the QME. The average action is explicitly evaluated in terms of the saddle
point approximation up to one-loop order. It is confirmed that the action
satisfies the QME and the flow equation.
