Current Algebra Associated with Logarithmic Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a general frame work for deriving the OPEs within a logarithmic
conformal field theory (LCFT). This naturally leads to the emergence of a
logarithmic partner of the energy momentum tensor within an LCFT, and implies
that the current algebra associated with an LCFT is expanded. We derive this
algebra for a generic LCFT and discuss some of its implications. We observe
that two constants arise in the OPE of the energy-momentum tensor with itself.
One of these is the usual central charge.
