Glueball Masses for the Deformed Conifold Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We obtain the spectrum of glueball masses for the N=1 non-conformal cascade
theory whose supergravity dual was recently constructed by Klebanov and
Strassler. The glueball masses are calculated by solving the supergravity
equations of motion for the dilaton and the two-form in the deformed conifold
background.
