The quantum SKdV$_{1,4}$ equation at $c=3$
</title>

<abstract>
  At $c=3$, two of the three integrable quantum $N=2$ supersymmetric
Korteweg-de Vries equations become identical (SKdV$_1$ and SKdV$_4$). Quite
remarkably, all their conservation laws can be written in closed form, which
provides thus a simple constructive integrability proof.
