Boundary Conformal Field Theories, Limit Sets of Kleinian Groups and
  Holography
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper,based on the available mathematical works on geometry and
topology of hyperbolic manifolds and discrete groups, some results of Freedman
et al (hep-th/9804058) are reproduced and broadly generalized. Among many new
results the possibility of extension of work of Belavin, Polyakov and
Zamolodchikov to higher dimensions is investigated. Known in physical
literature objections against such extension are removed and the possibility of
an extension is convincingly demonstrated.
