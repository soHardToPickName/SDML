<title>
On the Equivalence between 2D Induced Gravity and a WZNW system
</title>

<abstract>
  A general method of constructing canonical gauge invariant actions is used to
establish the equivalence between 2D induced gravity and a WZNW system, defined
by a difference of two simple WZNW actions fo the SL(2,R) group. The
diffeomorphism invariance of the induced gravity is generated by the SL(2,R)
Kac-Moody structure of the WZNW system.
