Tachyonic Kink and Lump-like Solutions in Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a kink solution on a non-BPS D-brane using Berkovits'
formulation of superstring field theory in the level truncation scheme. The
tension of the kink reproduces 95% of the expected BPS D-brane tension. We also
find a lump-like solution which is interpreted as a kink--antikink pair, and
investigate some of its properties. These results may be considered as
successful tests of Berkovits' superstring field theory combined with the
modified level truncation scheme.
