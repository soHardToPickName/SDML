<title>
A remarkable connection between Yangians and finite W-algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  For a large class of finite W algebras, the defining relations of a Yangian
are proved to be satisfied. Therefore such finite W algebras appear as
realisations of Yangians. This result is useful to determine properties of such
W algebra representations.
