Weyl Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the equations of motion of eleven-dimensional supergravity
follow from setting the dimension zero components of the superspace torsion
tensor equal to the Dirac matrices. The proof of this assertion is facilitated
by the introduction of a connection taking its values in the Lie algebra of
$Spin(1,10)\times R^+$.
