The SO(32) Heterotic String on a K3 Surface
</title>

<abstract>
  The SO(32) heterotic string on a K3 surface is analyzed in terms of the dual
theory of a type II string (or F-theory) on an elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau
manifold. The results are in beautiful agreement with earlier work by Witten
using very different methods. In particular, we find gauge groups of SO(32) x
Sp(k) appearing at points in the moduli space identified with point-like
instantons and see hypermultiplets in the (32,2k) representation becoming
massless at the same time. We also discuss some aspects of the E8 x E8 case.
