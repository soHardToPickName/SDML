q-Integration on Quantum Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we present formulae for q-integration on quantum spaces which
could be of particular importance in physics, i.e. q-deformed Minkowski space
and q-deformed Euclidean space in 3 or 4 dimensions. Furthermore, our formulae
can be regarded as a generalization of Jackson's q-integral to 3 and 4
dimensions.
