Derivation of quantum theories:symmetries and the exact solution of the
  derived system
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on the technique of derivation of a theory, presented in our recent
paper, we investigate the properties of the derived quantum system.
We show that the derived quantum system possesses the (nonanomalous) symmetries
of the original one, and prove that the exact Green functions of the derived
theory are expressed in terms of the semiclassically approximated Green
functions of the original theory.
