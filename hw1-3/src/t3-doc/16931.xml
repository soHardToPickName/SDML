Coarse graining and renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  Formulating the QFT's as coarse grained 'low' energy sectors of a postulated
complete quantum theory of everything with the 'high' energy modes integrated
out or 'clustering' into 'low' energy objects, we can evaluate the Feynman
amplitudes by solving a series of natural differential equations which
automatically dissolves the necessity of infinity subtraction and the
associated subtleties. This new strategy has direct implications to the scheme
dependence problem.
