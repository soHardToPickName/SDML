String Loop Corrections to Stable Non-BPS Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the string loop corrections to the tachyon potential for stable
non-BPS Dp-branes on the orbifold T^4/Z_2. We find a non-trivial phase
structure and we show that, after tachyon condensation, the non-BPS Dp-branes
are attracted to each other for p=0,1,2. We then identify the corresponding
closed string boundary states together with the massless long range fields they
excite. For p=3,4 the string loop correction diverge. We identify the massless
closed string fields responsible for these divergencies and regularise the
partition function using a Fischler-Susskind mechanism.
