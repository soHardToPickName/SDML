<title>
A Family of Dual N=2 Supergravity Actions in Ten-Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that non-chiral $N=2$ supergravity in ten-dimensions admits a family
of dual actions where the one-form, two-form or three-form is replaced by the
seven-form, six-form or five-form respectively. The dual actions and
supersymmetry transformations are given.
