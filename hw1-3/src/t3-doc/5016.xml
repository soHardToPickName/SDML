<title>
Higher-Order Lagrangian Theories and Noetherian Symmetries
</title>

<abstract>
  A geometric global formulation of the higher-order Lagrangian formalism for
systems with finite number of degrees of freedom is provided. The formalism is
applied to the study of systems with groups of Noetherian symmetries.
