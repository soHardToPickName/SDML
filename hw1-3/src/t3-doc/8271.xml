Hypothetic time -- temperature duality as a hint for modifications in
  quantum dynamics?
</title>

<abstract>
  The well-known formal analogy between time and absolute temperature, existing
on the quantum level, is considered as a profound duality relationship
requiring some modifications in the conventional quantum dynamics. They consist
of tiny deviations from uniform time run in the physical spacetime, as well as
of tiny deviations from unitary time evolution characteristic for the
conventional quantum theory. The first deviations are conjectured to be
produced by local changes of total average particle number. Then, they imply
the second deviations exerting in turn influence upon this particle number. Two
examples of the second deviations are described: hypothetic tiny violation of
optical theorem for particle scattering, and hypothetic slow variation of the
average number of probe particles contained in a sample situated in proximity
of a big accelerator (producing abundantly particles on a target).
