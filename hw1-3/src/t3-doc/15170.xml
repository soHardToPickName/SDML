Dressing a Scalar Mass up to Two-Loop Order at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we use Modified Self-Consistent Resummation (MSCR) in order to
obtain the scalar dressed mass by evaluating the self-energy up to two loops in
the neutral scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ model at finite temperature. With this
laboratory model we show that, if a theory is renormalizable at zero
temperature, using the MSCR it is always possible to obtain a finite corrected
mass at finite temperature. This feature of the MSCR is not observed in some
other approximation techniques usually found in the literature.
