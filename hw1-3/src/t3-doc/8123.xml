Perturbative Couplings of Vector Multiplets in $N=2$ Heterotic String
  Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the low-energy effective Lagrangian of $N=2$ heterotic string vacua
at the classical and quantum level. The couplings of the vector multiplets are
uniquely determined at the tree level, while the loop corrections are severely
constrained by the exact discrete symmetries of the string vacuum. We evaluate
the general transformation law of the perturbative prepotential and determine
its form for the toroidal compactifications of six-dimensional $N=1$
supersymmetric vacua.
