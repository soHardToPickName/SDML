Curves of Marginal Stability in N=2 Super-QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple argument determining the shape of the curves of marginal
stability in the N=2 supersymmetric SU(2) QCD with less than 4 massless
flavors. The argument relies only on the modular properties of $a_D/a$ and its
weak-coupling behavior.
