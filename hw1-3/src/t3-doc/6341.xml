<title>
Discontinuous behavior of perturbative Yang-Mills theories in the limit
  of dimensions D->2
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate in dimensions $D=2+\epsilon$ and in light-cone gauge (LCG) the
perturbative ${\cal O}(g^4)$ contribution to a rectangular Wilson loop in the
(t,x)-plane coming from diagrams with a self-energy correction in the vector
propagator. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ the result is finite, in spite of the
vanishing of the triple vector vertex in LCG, and provides the expected
agreement with the analogous calculation in Feynman gauge.
