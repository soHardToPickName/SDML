<title>
Test of gauged N=8 SUGRA / N=1 SYM duality at sub-leading order
</title>

<abstract>
  An infra-red fixed point of ${\mathcal N}=1$ super-Yang-Mills theory is
believed to be dual to a solution of five-dimensional gauged ${\mathcal N}=8$
supergravity. We test this conjecture at next to leading order in the large $N$
expansion by computing bulk one-loop corrections to the anomaly coefficient
$a-c$. The one-loop corrections are non-zero for all values of the bulk mass,
and not just special ones as claimed in previous work.
