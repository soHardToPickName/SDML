<title>
Superparticles, p-Form Coordinates and the BPS Condition
</title>

<abstract>
  A model for $n$ superparticles in $(d-n,n)$ dimensions is studied. The target
space supersymmetry involves a product of $n$ momentum generators, and the
action has $n(n+1)/2$ local bosonic symmetries and $n$ local fermionic
symmetries. The precise relation between the symmetries presented here and
those existing in the literature is explained. A new model is proposed for
superparticles in arbitrary dimensions where coordinates are associated with
all the $p$-form charges occuring in the superalgebra. The model naturally
gives rise to the BPS condition for the charges.
