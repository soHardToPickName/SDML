Schwinger-Dyson Equations and Chiral Symmetry Breaking in 2D Induced
  Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The Schwinger-Dyson equations in the ladder approximation for $2D$ induced
gravity coupled to fermions on a flat background are obtained in conformal
gauge. A numerical study of these equations shows the possiblity of chiral
symmetry breaking in this theory.
