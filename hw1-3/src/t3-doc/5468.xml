Nahm Data and the Mass of 1/4-BPS States
</title>

<abstract>
  The mass of 1/4-BPS dyonic configurations in N=4 D=4 supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theories is calculated within the Nahm formulation. The SU(3)
example, with two massive monopoles and one massless monopole, is considered in
detail. In this case, the massless monopole is attracted to the massive
monopoles by a linear potential.
