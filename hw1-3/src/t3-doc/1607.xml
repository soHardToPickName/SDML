Algorithmic information and simplicity in statistical physics
</title>

<abstract>
  Given a list of $N$ states with probabilities $0<p_1\leq\cdots\leq p_N$, the
average conditional algorithmic information $\bar I$ to specify one of these
states obeys the inequality $H\leq\bar I<H+O(1)$, where $H=-\sum p_j\log_2p_j$
and $O(1)$ is a computer-dependent constant. We show how any universal computer
can be slightly modified in such a way that the inequality becomes $H\leq\bar
I<H+1$, thereby eliminating the computer-dependent constant from statistical
physics.
