<title>
Two-Parametric Quantum-Deformed Dual Amplitude
</title>

<abstract>
  From a 2-parametric deformation of the harmonic oscillator algebra we
construct a 4-point dual amplitude with nonlinear trajectories. The earlier
versions of the q-deformed dual models are reproduced as limiting cases of the
present model.
