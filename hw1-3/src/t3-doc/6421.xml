<title>
Supergravity, AdS/CFT Correspondence and Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The recent developments towards the possible non-perturbative formulation of
string/M theory using supersymmetric Yang-Mills matrix models (SYMs) are
discussed. In the first part, we give a critical review on the status of our
present understanding, focusing on the connection of the D0-brane matrix models
to supergravity and its relevance to the so-called Matrix-theory conjecture. We
also discuss some problems concerning the conjectured relation between
supergravity in AdS background and SYM from the viewpoint of D-brane
interactions. We present a qualitative argument showing how the boundary
condition at AdS boundary dictates the correlators on the large N system of
source D-branes. Then, in the final part, we turn to the question how to
formulate the condensation of graviton in matrix models, taking the simplest
example of type IIB matrix model. We argue the emergence of a hidden symmetry
GL(10, R), beyond the manifest Lorentz symmetry SO(9,1), by embedding U(N)
model into models with higher N and by treating the whole recursive series of
models simultaneously. This suggests a possible approach toward background
independent formulations of matrix models.
