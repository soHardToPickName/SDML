<title>
New Algebra of Local Symmetries for Regge Limit of Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Local effective action is derived to describe Regge asymptotic of Yang-Mills
theories. Local symmetries of the effective action originating from the gauge
symmetry of the underlying Yang-Mills theory are studied. Multicomponent
effective action is introduced to express the symmetry transformations as field
transformations. The algebra of these symmetries is decomposed onto a
semi-direct sum of commutative algebras and four copies of the gauge algebra of
the underlying Yang-Mills theory. Possibility of existence of solitons
corresponding to the commutative subalgebra of the symmetry algebra is
mentioned.
