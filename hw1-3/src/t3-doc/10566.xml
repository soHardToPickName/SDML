<title>
The universal gerbe, Dixmier-Douady class, and gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We clarify the relation between the Dixmier-Douady class on the space of self
adjoint Fredholm operators (`universal B-field') and the curvature of
determinant bundles over infinite-dimensional Grassmannians. In particular, in
the case of Dirac type operators on a three dimensional compact manifold we
obtain a simple and explicit expression for both forms.
