Topological Terms in String Theory on Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study toroidal orbifold models with topologically invariant terms in the
path integral formalism and give physical interpretations of the terms from an
operator formalism point of view. We briefly discuss a possibility of a new
class of modular invariant orbifold models.
