<title>
Pair production of black holes in a $U(1) \otimes U(1)$ theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Charged dilaton black hole solutions have recently been found for an action
with two $U(1)$ gauge fields and a dilaton field. I investigate new exact
solutions of this theory analogous to the C-metric and Ernst solutions of
classical general relativity. The parameters in the latter solution may be
restricted so that it has a smooth Euclidean section with topology $S^2 \times
S^2 - \{pt\}$, which gives an instanton describing pair production of the
charged dilaton black holes. These instantons generalise those found recently
by Dowker {\it et al}.
