<title>
The spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator and chiral random matrix theory:
  the threefold way
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator near zero virtuality can
be described by random matrix theory. As in the case of classical random matrix
ensembles of Dyson we have three distinct classes: the chiral orthogonal
ensemble (chGOE), the chiral unitary ensemble (chGUE) and the chiral symplectic
ensemble (chGSE). They correspond to gauge groups $SU(2)$ in the fundamental
representation, $SU(N_c), N_c \ge 3$ in the fundamental representation, and
gauge groups for all $N_c$ in the adjoint representation, respectively. The
joint probability density reproduces Leutwyler-Smilga sum rules.
