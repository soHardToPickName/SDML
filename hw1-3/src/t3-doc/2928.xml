<title>
Lorentz and CPT Violating Chern-Simons Term in the Formulation of
  Functional Integral
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that in the functional integral formalism the (finite) coefficient of
the induced, Lorentz- and CPT-violating Chern-Simons term, arising from the
Lorentz- and CPT-violating fermion sector, is undetermined.
