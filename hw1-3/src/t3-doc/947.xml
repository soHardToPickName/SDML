<title>
Stress-energy of a quantized scalar field in static wormhole spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  An analytical approximation of $<T_{\mu\nu}>$ for a quantized scalar field in
a static spherically symmetric spacetime with a topology $S^2 \times R^2$ is
obtained. The gravitational background is assumed slowly varying. The scalar
field is assumed to be both massive and massless, with an arbitrary coupling
$\xi$ to the scalar curvature and in a zero temperature vacuum state. It is
demonstrated that for some values of curvature coupling the stress-energy has
the properties needed to support the wormhole geometry.
