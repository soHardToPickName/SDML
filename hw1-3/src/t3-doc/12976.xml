<title>
Geodesics and BPS States in N=2 Supersymmetric QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Conformal mapping techniques are used to determine analytically the geodesics
on the Seiberg-Witten Riemann surface which correspond to the BPS dyon states
in N=2 SUSY QCD with gauge group SU(2) and up to three flavors of massless
fundamental matter. The results are exact for zero and two flavors, and
approximate in the weak-coupling limit for one and three flavors. The presence
of states of magnetic charge 2, in the three-flavor case only, is confirmed.
