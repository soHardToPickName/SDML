<title>
Supersymmetric R^4 actions and quantum corrections to superspace torsion
  constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the supersymmetrisation of the anomaly-related R^4 term in eleven
dimensions and show that it induces no non-trivial modifications to the
on-shell supertranslation algebra and the superspace torsion constraints before
inclusion of gauge-field terms.
