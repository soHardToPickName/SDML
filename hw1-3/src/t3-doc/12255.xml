The Quantum Geometry of Spin and Statistics
</title>

<abstract>
  Both, spin and statistics of a quantum system can be seen to arise from
underlying (quantum) group symmetries. We show that the spin-statistics theorem
is equivalent to a unification of these symmetries. Besides covering the
Bose-Fermi case we classify the corresponding possibilities for anyonic spin
and statistics. We incorporate the underlying extended concept of symmetry into
quantum field theory in a generalised path integral formulation capable of
handling general braid statistics. For bosons and fermions the different path
integrals and Feynman rules naturally emerge without introducing Grassmann
variables. We also consider the anyonic example of quons and obtain the path
integral counterpart to the usual canonical approach.
