Non-Abelian gauge theory on noncommutative spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a brief introduction to the construction of gauge theories on
noncommutative spaces with star products. Particular emphasis is given to
issues related to non-Abelian gauge groups and charge quantization. This talk
is based on joined work with B. Jurco, J. Madore, L. Moeller, S. Schraml and J.
Wess.
