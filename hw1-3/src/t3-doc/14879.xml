Finiteness following from underlying theory: a natural strategy
</title>

<abstract>
  A tentative proposal is demonstrated that there is a natural strategy to get
rid of unphysical (UV) infinities in QFTs if one adopts the modern standard
point of view that a fundamental theory that is complete and well-defined in
all respects underlies the QFTs. This simple strategy works in principle for
any interaction model and space-time dimension. It provides a physical
rationality behind the UV divergence and the conventional renormalization
programs and improves the latter in several important aspects.
