<title>
Hyperbolic Kac-Moody Algebra from Intersecting p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A subclass of recently discovered class of solutions in multidimensional
gravity with intersecting p-branes related to Lie algebras and governed by a
set of harmonic functions is considered. This subclass in case of three
Euclidean p-branes (one electric and two magnetic) contains a cosmological-type
solution (in 11-dimensional model with two 4-forms) related to hyperbolic
Kac-Moody algebra ${\cal F}_3$ (of rank 3). This solution describes the
non-Kasner power-law inflation.
