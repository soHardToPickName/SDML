<title>
Gravitating Yang-Mills vortices in 4+1 spacetime dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The coupling to gravity in D=5 spacetime dimensions is considered for the
particle-like and vortex-type solutions obtained by uplifting the D=4
Yang-Mills instantons and D=3 Yang-Mills-Higgs monopoles. It turns out that the
particles become completely destroyed by gravity, while the vortices admit a
rich spectrum of gravitating generalizations. Such vortex defects may be
interesting in view of the AdS/CFT correspondence or in the context of the
brane world scenario.
