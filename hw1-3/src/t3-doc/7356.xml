Four-point functions in N=2 superconformal field theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Four-point correlation functions of hypermultiplet bilinear composites are
analysed in N=2 superconformal field theory using the superconformal Ward
identities and the analyticity properties of the composite operator
superfields. It is shown that the complete amplitude is determined by a single
arbitrary function of the two conformal cross-ratios of the space-time
variables.
