On New Conformal Field Theories with Affine Fusion Rules
</title>

<abstract>
  Some time ago, conformal data with affine fusion rules were found. Our
purpose here is to realize some of these conformal data, using systems of free
bosons and parafermions. The so constructed theories have an extended $W$
algebras which are close analogues of affine algebras. Exact character formulae
is given, and the realizations are shown to be full fledged unitary conformal
field theories.
