<title>
Random Bond Potts Model: the Test of the Replica Symmetry Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  Averaged spin-spin correlation function squared
$\overline{<\sigma(0)\sigma(R)>^{2}}$ is calculated for the ferromagnetic
random bond Potts model. The technique being used is the renormalization group
plus conformal field theory. The results are of the $\epsilon$ - expansion type
fixed point calculation, $\epsilon$ being the deviation of the central charge
(or the number of components) of the Potts model from the Ising model value.
Calculations are done both for the replica symmetric and the replica symmetry
broken fixed points. The results obtained allow for the numerical simulation
tests to decide between the two different criticalities of the random bond
Potts model.
