<title>
The 3-string vertex and the AdS/CFT duality in the PP-wave limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We pursue the study of string interactions in the PP-wave background and show
that the proposal of hep-th/0211188 can be extended to a full supersymmetric
vertex. Then we compute some string amplitudes in both the bosonic and
fermionic sector, finding agreement with the field theory results at leading
order in lambda'.
