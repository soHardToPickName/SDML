Algebraic solution for the vector potential in the Dirac equation
</title>

<abstract>
  The Dirac equation for an electron in an external electromagnetic field can
be regarded as a singular set of linear equations for the vector potential.
Radford's method of algebraically solving for the vector potential is reviewed,
with attention to the additional constraints arising from non-maximality of the
rank. The extension of the method to general spacetimes is illustrated by
examples in diverse dimensions with both $c$- and $a$-number wavefunctions.
