Twisting to Abelian BF/Chern-Simons Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a $D=3$, $N=4$ supersymmetric theory for matter fields, a twist
with a Grassmann parity change is defined which maps the theory into a gauge
fixed, abelian $BF$ theory on curved 3-manifolds. After adding surface terms to
this theory, the twist is seen to map the resulting supersymmetric action to
two uncoupled copies of the gauge fixed Chern-Simons action. In addition, we
give a map which takes the $BF$ and Chern-Simons theories into Donaldson-Witten
TQFT's. A similar construction, but with $N=2$ supersymmetry, is given in two
dimensions.
