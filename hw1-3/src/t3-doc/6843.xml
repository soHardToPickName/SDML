<title>
Dynamics of a planar domain wall with oscillating thickness in \lambda
  \Phi^{4} model
</title>

<abstract>
  Domain wall - type solution with oscillating thickness in a real, scalar
field model is investigated with the help of a polynomial approximation. We
propose a simple extension of the polynomial approximation method. In this
approach we calculate higher order corrections to the planar domain wall
solution, find that the domain wall with oscillating thickness radiates, and
compute dumping of oscillations of the domain wall.
