<title>
The boundary supersymmetric sine-Gordon model revisited
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that, contrary to previous claims, the supersymmetric sine-Gordon
model with boundary has a two-parameter family of boundary interactions which
preserves both integrability and supersymmetry. We also propose the
corresponding boundary S matrix for the first supermultiplet of breathers.
