Wess-Zumino term for AdS superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine a bilinear form Wess-Zumino term for a superstring in anti-de
Sitter (AdS) spaces. This is composed of two parts; a bilinear term in
superinvariant currents and a total derivative bilinear term which is required
for the pseudo-superinvariance of the Wess-Zumino term. The covariant
supercharge commutator containing a string charge is also obtained.
