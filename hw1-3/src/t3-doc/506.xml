<title>
Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Group at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a gauge-invariant version of Wilson Renormalization Group for
thermal field theories in real time. The application to the computation of the
thermal masses of the gauge bosons in an SU(N) Yang-Mills theory is discussed.
