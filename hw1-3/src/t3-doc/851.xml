<title>
Understanding Radiatively Induced Lorentz-CPT Violation in Differential
  Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  We have investigated the perturbative ambiguity of the radiatively induced
Chern-Simons term in differential regularization. The result obtained in this
method contains all those obtained in other regularization schemes and the
ambiguity is explicitly characterized by an indefinite ratio of two
renormalization scales. It is argued that the ambiguity can only be eliminated
by either imposing a physical requirement or resorting to a more fundamental
principle. Some calculation techniques in coordinate space are developed in the
appendices.
