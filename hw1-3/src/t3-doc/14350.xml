<title>
Vector Bundles And F Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  To understand in detail duality between heterotic string and F theory
compactifications, it is important to understand the construction of
holomorphic G bundles over elliptic Calabi-Yau manifolds, for various groups G.
In this paper, we develop techniques to describe the bundles, and make several
detailed comparisons between the heterotic string and F theory.
