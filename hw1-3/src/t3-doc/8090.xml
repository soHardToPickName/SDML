<title>
BRST and Anti BRST structure of a topological current algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST structure of a current satisfying a non abelian affine algebra in
two dimensions was studied by Isidro and Ramallo and an N=2 Superconformal
Algebra was obtained. In this paper, we study the total BRST and anti BRST
structure of the topological algebra. We end up with an N=4 Superconformal
algebra in which the central charge drops out of most of the OPE's. The price
one has to pay is that the no. of operators proliferates tremendously and the
algebra becomes infinite dimensional.
