Matrix Models: Fermion Doubling vs. Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  We present some arguments showing spectrum doubling of matrix models in the
limit $N\to\infty$ which is connected with fermionic determinant behaviour. The
problems are similar to ones encountered in the lattice gauge theories with
chiral fermions. One may discuss the ``physical meaning'' of the doubling
states or ways to eliminate them. We briefly consider both situations.
