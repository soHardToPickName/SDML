Variational Perturbation Approach to Resonance-State Wave Functions
</title>

<abstract>
  The variational perturbation theory for wave functions, which has been shown
to work well for bound states of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied to
resonance states of the anharmonic oscillator with negative coupling constant.
We obtain uniformly accurate wave functions starting from the bound states.
