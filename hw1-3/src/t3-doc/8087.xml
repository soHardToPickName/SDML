<title>
The Zero Tension Limit of The Virasoro Algebra and the Central Extension
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that the Virasoro algebra for the closed bosonic string can be cast
in a form which is suitable for the limit of vanishing string tension. In this
form the limit of the Virasoro algebra gives the null string algebra. The
anomalous central extension is seen to vanish as well when $T\to 0$.
