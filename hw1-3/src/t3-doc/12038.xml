The Star Product on the Fuzzy Supersphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The fuzzy supersphere $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is a finite-dimensional matrix
approximation to the supersphere $S^{(2,2)}$ incorporating supersymmetry
exactly. Here the star-product of functions on $S_F^{(2,2)}$ is obtained by
utilizing the OSp(2,1) coherent states. We check its graded commutative limit
to $S^{(2,2)}$ and extend it to fuzzy versions of sections of bundles using the
methods of [1]. A brief discussion of the geometric structure of our
star-product completes our work.
