No consistent cross-interactions for a collection of massless spin-2
  fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We report a no-go theorem excluding consistent cross-couplings for a
collection of massless, spin-2 fields described, in the free limit, by the sum
of Pauli-Fierz actions (one for each field). We show that, in spacetime
dimensions >2, there is no consistent coupling, with at most two derivatives of
the fields, that can mix the various "gravitons". The only possible
deformations are given by the sum of individual Einstein-Hilbert actions (one
for each field) with cosmological terms. Our approach is based on the
BRST-based deformation point of view.
