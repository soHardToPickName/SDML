<title>
On the Characterization of Classical Dynamical Systems Using
  Supersymmetric Nonlinear $\sigma$-models
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a two dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$-model that describes the
Hamiltonian flow in the loop space of a classical dynamical system. This model
is obtained by equivariantizing the standard N=1 supersymmetric nonlinear
$\sigma$-model by the Hamiltonian flow. We use localization methods to evaluate
the corresponding partition function for a general class of integrable systems,
and find relations that can be viewed as generalizations of standard relations
in classical Morse theory.
