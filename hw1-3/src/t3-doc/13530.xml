<title>
Warped compactification on Abelian vortex in six dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the possibility of localizing gravity on a Nielsen-Olesen vortex
in the context of the Abelian Higgs model. The vortex lives in a
six-dimensional space-time with negative bulk cosmological constant. In this
model we find a region of the parameter space leading, simultaneously, to
warped compactification and to regular space-time geometry. A thin defect limit
is studied. Regular solutions describing warped compactifications in the case
of higher winding number are also presented.
