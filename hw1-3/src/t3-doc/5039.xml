Introduction to Hopf algebras in renormalization and noncommutative
  geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the appearance of Hopf algebras in the renormalization of quantum
field theories and in the study of diffeomorphisms of the frame bundle
important for index computations in noncommutative geometry.
