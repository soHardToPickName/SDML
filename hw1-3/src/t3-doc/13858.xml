<title>
O(4) texture with a cosmological constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate O(4) textures in a background with a positive cosmological
constant. We find static solutions which co-move with the expanding background.
There exists a solution in which the scalar field is regular at the horizon.
This solution has a noninteger winding number smaller than one. There also
exist solutions in which scalar-field derivatives are singular at the horizon.
Such solutions can complete one winding within the horizon. If the winding
number is larger than some critical value, static solutions including the
regular one are unstable under perturbations.
