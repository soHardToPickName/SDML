From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology
  Protection Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  The recent interest in ``time machines'' has been largely fueled by the
apparent ease with which such systems may be formed in general relativity,
given relatively benign initial conditions such as the existence of traversable
wormholes or of infinite cosmic strings. This rather disturbing state of
affairs has led Hawking to formulate his Chronology Protection Conjecture,
whereby the formation of ``time machines'' is forbidden. This paper will use
several simple examples to argue that the universe appears to exhibit a
``defense in depth'' strategy in this regard. For appropriate parameter regimes
Casimir effects, wormhole disruption effects, and gravitational back reaction
effects all contribute to the fight against time travel. Particular attention
is paid to the role of the quantum gravity cutoff. For the class of model
problems considered it is shown that the gravitational back reaction becomes
large before the Planck scale quantum gravity cutoff is reached, thus
supporting Hawking's conjecture.
