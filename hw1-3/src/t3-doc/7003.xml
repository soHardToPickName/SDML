Form factors of the XXZ model and the affine quantum group symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We present new expressions of form factors of the XXZ model which satisfy
Smirnov's three axioms. These new form factors are obtained by acting the
affine quantum group $U_q (\hat{\frak s \frak l_2})$ to the known ones
obtained in our previous works. We also find the relations among all the new
and known form factors, i.e., all other form factors can be expressed as kind
of descendents of a special one.
