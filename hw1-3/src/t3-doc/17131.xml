Comment on "Metric Fluctuations in Brane Worlds"
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, Ivanov and Volovich (hep-th/9912242) claimed that the perturbation
of $h_{\mu\nu}$ with nonvanishing transverse components $h_{5\mu}$ is not
localized on the brane because $h_{\mu\nu}$ depends on the fifth coordinate $z$
linearly. Consequently, it may indicate that the effective theory is unstable.
However, we point out that such linear dependence on $z$ can be {\it gauged
away}. Hence the solution does not belong to the physical one. Therefore, even
if one includes $h_{5\mu}$, Randall and Sundrum's argument for the localized
gravity on the brane remains correct.
