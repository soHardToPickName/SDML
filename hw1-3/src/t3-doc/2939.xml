<title>
Difficulties in Formulating an imaginary-time formalism of temporal
  axial gauge at finite T
</title>

<abstract>
  Following the successful construction of the finite T real-time formalism in
temporal axial gauge, we attempt to further study the equivalent new
imaginary-time formalism of James and Landshoff based on the same Hamiltonian
approach in the hope that it will provide the answer to Debye screening in QCD.
It turns out that, unlike in the real-time case, energy conservation does not
hold because of the unusual representation of the longitudinal field forced
upon by the Hamiltonian formulation.
