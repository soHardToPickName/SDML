PhreMology--calibrating M-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  The relevance of calibrations, and `generalized' calibrations, to
supersymmetric M-brane configurations, and their associated field theories, is
reviewed, with emphasis on applications to domain walls and domain wall
junctions of D=4 N=1 supersymmetric field theories.
