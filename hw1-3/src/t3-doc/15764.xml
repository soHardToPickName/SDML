Basic Representations of A_{2l}^(2) and D_{l+1}^(2) and the Polynomial
  Solutions to the Reduced BKP Hierarchies
</title>

<abstract>
  Basic representations of A_{2l}^(2) and D_{l+1}^(2) are studied. The weight
vectors are represented in terms of Schur's $Q$-functions. The method to get
the polynomial solutions to the reduced BKP hierarchies is shown to be
equivalent to a certain rule in Maya game.
