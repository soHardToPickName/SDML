A Note on Effective Lagrangians in Matrix Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relation between the effective Lagrangian in Matrix Theory and
eleven dimensional supergravity. In particular, we provide a relationship
between supergravity operators and the corresponding terms in the
post-Newtonian approximation of Matrix Theory.
