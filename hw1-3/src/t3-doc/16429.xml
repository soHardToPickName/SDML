<title>
Ultraviolet Limit of Open String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We confirm the intuition that a string theory which is perturbatively
infrared finite is automatically perturbatively ultraviolet finite. Our
derivation based on the asymptotics of the Selberg trace formula for the Greens
function on a Riemann surface holds for both open and closed string amplitudes
and is independent of modular invariance and supersymmetry. The masses of the
open strings stretched between Dbranes give a natural world-sheet ultraviolet
regulator for the string path integral preserving both T-duality and
open-closed string world-sheet duality.
