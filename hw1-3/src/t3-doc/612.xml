<title>
M-Theory (the Theory Formerly Known as Strings)
</title>

<abstract>
  Superunification underwent a major paradigm shift in 1984 when
eleven-dimensional supergravity was knocked off its pedestal by ten-dimensional
superstrings. This last year has witnessed a new shift of equal proportions:
perturbative ten-dimensional superstrings have in their turn been superseded by
a new non-perturbative theory called {\it $M$-theory}, which describes
supermembranes and superfivebranes, which subsumes all five consistent string
theories and whose low energy limit is, ironically, eleven-dimensional
supergravity. In particular, six-dimensional string/string duality follows from
membrane/fivebrane duality by compactifying $M$-theory on $S^1/Z_2 \times K3$
(heterotic/heterotic duality) or $S^1 \times K3$ (Type $IIA$/heterotic
duality) or $S^1/Z_2 \times T^4$ (heterotic/Type $IIA$ duality) or $S^1 \times
T^4$ (Type $IIA$/Type $IIA$ duality).
