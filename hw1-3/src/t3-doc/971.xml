Information Spreading in Interacting String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The commutator of string fields is considered in the context of light cone
string field theory. It is shown that the commutator is in general
non--vanishing outside the string light cone. This could have profound
implications for our understanding of the localization of information in
quantum gravity.
