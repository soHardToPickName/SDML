<title>
Quantum Deformation of the Poincare Supergroup and $\kappa$-deformed
  Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical $r$-matrix for $N=1$ superPoincar{\'e} algebra, given by
Lukierski, Nowicki and Sobczyk is used to describe the graded Poisson structure
on the $N=1$ Poincar{\'e} supergroup. The standard correspondence principle
between the even (odd) Poisson brackets and (anti)commutators leads to the
consistent quantum deformation of the superPoincar{\'e} group with the
deformation parameter $q$ described by fundamental mass parameter $\kappa \quad
(\kappa^{-1}=\ln{q})$. The $\kappa$-deformation of $N=1$ superspace as dual to
the $\kappa$-deformed supersymmetry algebra is discussed.
