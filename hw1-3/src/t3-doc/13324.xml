Wigner quantum systems (Lie superalgebraic approach)
</title>

<abstract>
  We present three groups of examples of Wigner Quantum Systems related to the
Lie superalgebras $osp(1/6n)$, $sl(1/3n)$ and $sl(n/3)$ and discuss shortly
their physical features. In the case of $sl(1/3n)$ we indicate that the
underlying geometry is noncommutative.
