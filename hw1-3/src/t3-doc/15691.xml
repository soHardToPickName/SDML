String action with multiplet of $\Theta$-terms and the hidden Poincare
  symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study string action with multiplet of $\Theta$-terms added, which turns
out to be closely related with the bosonic sector of D=11 superstring action
[3,4]. Alternatively, the model can be considered as describing class of
special solutions of the membrane. An appropriate set of variables is find, in
which the light-cone quantization turns out to be possible. It is shown that
anomaly terms in the algebra of the light-cone Poincare generators are absent
for the case D=27.
