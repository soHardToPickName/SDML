Dyons in Nonabelian Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze a nonabelian extension of Born--Infeld action for the SU(2) group.
In the class of spherically symmetric solutions we find that, besides the
Gal'tsov--Kerner glueballs, only the analytic dyons have finite energy. The
presented analytic and numerical investigation excludes the existence of pure
magnetic monopoles of 't Hooft--Polyakov type.
