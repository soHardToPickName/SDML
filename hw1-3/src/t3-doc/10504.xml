<title>
On the Quantizations of the Damped Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on a simple observation that a classical second order differential
equation may be decomposed into a set of two first order equations, we
introduce a Hamiltonian framework to quantize the damped systems. In
particular, we analyze the system of a linear damped harmonic oscillator and
demonstrate that the time evolution of the Schr\"odinger equation is
unambiguously determined.
