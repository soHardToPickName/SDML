Two-point Functions in Affine SL(N) Current Algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter the explicit form of general two-point functions in affine
SL(N) current algebra is provided for all representations, integrable or
non-integrable. The weight of the conjugate field to a primary field of
arbitrary weight is immediately read off.
