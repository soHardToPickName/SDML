Stabilization and radion in de Sitter brane-world
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the stabilization of de Sitter brane-world. The scalar field
bulk-brane theory produces the non-trivial minimum of modulus potential where
temporal radion is realized. The hierarchy problem (between Planck and
electroweak scales) may be solved. However, the interpretation of radion is not
so clear as in AdS brane-world. In particulary, the introduction of two times
physics or pair-creation of bulk spaces or identification of one of spatial
coordinates with imaginary time (non-zero temperature) may be required.
