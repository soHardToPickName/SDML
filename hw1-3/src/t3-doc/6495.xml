<title>
Explicit SU(5) monopole solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe in detail a general scheme for embedding several BPS monopoles
into a theory with a larger gauge group, which generalizes embeddings of SU(2)
monopoles discussed by several authors. This construction is applied to obtain
explicit fields for monopoles with several charge configurations in the
SU(5)\to [SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)]/Z_6 model.
