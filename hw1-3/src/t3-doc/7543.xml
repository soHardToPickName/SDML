<title>
Deformed Nahm Equation and a Noncommutative BPS Monopole
</title>

<abstract>
  A deformed Nahm equation for the BPS equation in the noncommutative N=4
supersymmetric U(2) Yang-Mills theory is obtained. Using this, we constructed
explicitly a monopole solution of the noncommutative BPS equation to the linear
order of the noncommutativity scale. We found that the leading order correction
to the ordinary SU(2) monopole lies solely in the overall U(1) sector and that
the overall U(1) magnetic field has an expected long range component of
magnetic dipole moment.
