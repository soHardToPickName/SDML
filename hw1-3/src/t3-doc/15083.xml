<title>
Simple Construction of Elliptic Boundary K-Matrix
</title>

<abstract>
  We give the infinite-dimensional representation for the elliptic $ K
$-operator satisfying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation. By restricting the
functional space to finite-dimensional space, we construct the elliptic $ K
$-matrix associated to Belavin's completely $ \mathbb{Z} $-symmetric $ R
$-matrix.
