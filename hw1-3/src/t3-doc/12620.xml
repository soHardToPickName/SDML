Stochastic Approach to a non de Sitter Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop a stochastic approach to a non de Sitter Universe in a
gauge-invariant way and obtain a system of Langevin-type equations which may be
considered to be renormalization group equations for the long wave parts of the
scalar fields and metric. We investigate in detail the case of generalized
power-law inflation that appears in the model of the deflationary exit from the
inflationary stage. For this case the above system is simplified greatly, we
derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the scalar field driving inflation, find
its stationary solutions and solve the FP equation for a delta-function initial
distribution of the field.
