<title>
6D black string as a model of the AdS/CFT correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the entropy for the extremal BTZ black hole and the extremal EBTZ
black hole. The EBTZ black hole means the BTZ black hole embedded in a
five-dimensional(5D) black hole. The six-dimensional(6D) black string with
traveling waves is introduced as a concrete model for realizing the AdS/CFT
correspondence. The traveling waves carry the momentum distribution $p(u)$
which plays an important role in counting the entropy and establishing the
correspondence. It turns out that the EBTZ black hole is consistent with the
AdS/CFT correspondence.
