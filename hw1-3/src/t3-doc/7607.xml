Power-Law Inflation from the Rolling Tachyon
</title>

<abstract>
  Modeling the potential by an inverse square law in terms of the tachyon field
($V(T)=\beta T^{-2}$) we find exact solution for spatially flat isotropic
universe.We show that for $\beta>2\sqrt{3}/3$ the model undergoes power-law
inflation. A way to construct other exact solutions is specified and
exemplified.
