<title>
The Geometrical Basis of the Nonlinear Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Yang-Mills theory in Euclidean space time R4 and construct its
configuration space. The orbits are first shown to form a congruence set. Then
we show that in spite of the fact that there can be no orthogonal gauge in the
non-Abelian theory, the submanifolds defined by the non-linear gauge previously
proposed by the author are shown to foliate the configuration space. This was
accomplished by making use of the form version of Frobenius theorem.
