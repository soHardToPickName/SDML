Black Hole Evaporation and Compact Extra Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the evaporation of black holes in space-times with extra dimensions
of size L. We first obtain a description which interpolates between the
expected behaviors of very large and very small black holes and then show that
the luminosity is greatly damped when the horizon shrinks towards L from a
larger value. Analogously, black holes born with an initial size smaller than L
are almost stable. This effect is due to the dependence of both the Hawking
temperature and the grey-body factor of a black hole on the dimensionality of
space. Although the picture of what happens when the horizon becomes of size L
is still incomplete, we argue that there occurs a (first order) phase
transition, possibly signaled by an outburst of energy which leaves a
quasi-stable remnant.
