<title>
Geometric quantisation of the global Liouville mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The reduced SL(2,R) WZW quantum mechanics is analysed in the framework of
geometric quantization. The spectrum of the Hamiltonian is determined, and it
is found, that contrary to the previous approaches, there is a unique,
physically preferred quantisation of the system.
