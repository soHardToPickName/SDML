<title>
Fusion Algebras Induced by Representations of the Modular Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the representation theory of the subgroups SL_2(Z_p) of the modular
group we investigate the induced fusion algebras in some simple examples.
Only some of these representations lead to 'good' fusion algebras.
Furthermore, the conformal dimensions and the central charge of the
corresponding rational conformal field theories are calculated. Two series of
representations which can be realized by unitary theories are presented. We
show that most of the fusion algebras induced by admissible representations
are realized in well known rational models.
