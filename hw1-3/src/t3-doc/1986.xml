Super-${\tau}_{3}$QED and the dimensional reduction of $N$$=$$1$
  super-{QED}$_{2+2}$
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work the supersymmetric gauge invariant action for the massive
Abelian $N$$=$$1$ super-{\QED} in the Atiyah-Ward space-time ({\DDdd}) is
formulated. The questions concerning the scheme of the gauge invariance in
{\DDdd} by means of gauging the massive $N$$=$$1$ super-{\QED} are
investigated. We study how to ensure the gauge invariance at the expenses of
the introduction of a complex vector superfield. We discuss the Wess-Zumino
gauge and thereupon we conclude that in this gauge, only the imaginary part of
the complex vector field, $B_{\m}$, gauges a $U(1)$-symmetry, whereas its real
part gauges a Weyl symmetry. We build up the gauge invariant massive term by
introducing a pair of chiral and anti-chiral superfields with opposite
$U(1)$-charges. We carry out a dimensional reduction {\it{\`a la}} Scherk of
the massive $N$$=$$1$ super-{\QED} action from {\DDdd} to {\Ddd}. Truncations
are needed in order to suppress non-physical modes and one ends up with a
parity-preserving $N$$=$$1$ super-QED$_{1+2}$ (rather than $N$$=$$2$) in
$D$$=$$1$$+$$2$. Finally, we show that the $N$$=$$1$ super-QED$_{1+2}$ we have
got is the supersymmetric version ofthe ${\tau}_{3}$QED .
