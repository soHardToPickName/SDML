<title>
Berry phase connection and anomaly in two dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  For the generalized chiral Schwinger model defined on the circle, a direct
calculation of the zero curvature part of the vacuum Berry phase connection is
given. Although this part does not contribute to the curvature, it is shown to
attach several features to the total connection and to produce a physical
background of linearly rising electric fields.
