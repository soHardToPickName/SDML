<title>
Anomalous Behavior in the Massive Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the chiral condensate and Polyakov loop in two-dimensional QED
with a fermion of an arbitrary mass ($m$). We find discontinuous $m$ dependence
in the chiral condensate and anomalous temperature dependence in Polyakov loops
when the vacuum angle $\theta$$\sim$$\pi$ and $m$=O($e$). These nonperturbative
phenomena are due to the bifurcation process in the solutions to the vacuum
eigenvalue equation.
