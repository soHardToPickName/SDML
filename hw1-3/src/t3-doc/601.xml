Cosmological Brane World Solutions with Bulk Scalar Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Cosmological brane world solutions are found for five-dimensional bulk
spacetimes with a scalar field. A supergravity inspired method for obtaining
static solutions is combined with a method for finding brane cosmologies with
constant bulk energies. This provides a way to generate full (bulk and brane)
cosmological solutions to brane worlds with bulk scalar fields. Examples of
these solutions, and their cosmological evolution, are discussed.
