Black Hole Solutions of Kaluza-Klein Supergravity Theories and String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
We find U(1)_{E} \times U(1)_{M} non-extremal black hole solutions of
6-dimensional Kaluza-Klein supergravity theories. Extremal solutions were found
by Cveti\v{c} and Youm\cite{C-Y}. Multi black hole solutions are also
presented. After electro-magnetic duality transformation is performed, these
multi black hole solutions are mapped into the the exact solutions found by
Horowitz and Tseytlin\cite{H-T} in 5-dimensional string theory compactified
into 4-dimensions. The massless fields of this theory can be embedded into the
heterotic string theory compactified on a 6-torus. Rotating black hole
solutions can be read off those of the heterotic string theory found by
Sen\cite{Sen3}.
