Implications of quaternionic dark matter
</title>

<abstract>
  Taking the complex nature of quantum mechanics which we observe today as a
low energy effect of a broken quaternionic theory we explore the possibility
that dark matter arises as a consequence of this underlying quaternionic
structure to our universe. We introduce a low energy, effective, Lagrangian
which incorporates the remnants of a local quaternionic algebra, investigate
the stellar production of the resultant exotic bosons and explore the possible
low energy consequences of our remnant extended Hilbert space.
