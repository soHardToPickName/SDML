Tailoring T-Duality Beyond the First Loop
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we review a recent calculation of the two-loop $\sigma$-model
corrections to the T-duality map in string theory. Using the effective action
approach, and focusing on backgrounds with a single Abelian isometry, we give
the $O(\alpha')$ modifications of the lowest-order duality transformations. The
torsion plays an important role in the theory to $O(\alpha')$, because of the
Chern-Simons couplings to the gauge fields that arise via dimensional
reduction.
