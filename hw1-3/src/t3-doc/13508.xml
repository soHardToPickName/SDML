Reflexive Polyhedra and their Applications in String and F-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an informal introduction to the concept of reflexive polyhedra and
some of their most important applications in perturbative and non-perturbative
string physics. Following the historical development, topics like mirror
symmetry, gauged linear sigma models, and the geometrical structures relevant
to string and F-theory dualities are discussed. Finally some recent
developments concerning the classification of reflexive polyhedra are
mentioned.
