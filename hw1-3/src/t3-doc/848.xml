<title>
A Closed form for Consistent Anomalies in Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The new method for solving the descent equations for gauge theories proposed
in \cite{s} is shown to be equivalent with that based on the {\em "Russian
formula"}. Moreover it allows to obtain in a closed form the expressions of the
consistent anomalies in any space-time dimension.
