Real time correlations at finite Temperature for the Ising model
</title>

<abstract>
  After having developed a method that measures real time evolution of quantum
systems at a finite temperature, we present here the simplest field theory
where this scheme can be applied to, namely the 1+1 Ising model.
  We will compute the probability that if a given spin is up, some other spin
will be up after a time $t$, the whole system being at temperature $T$. We can
thus study spatial correlations and relaxation times at finite $T$. The fixed
points that enable the continuum real time limit can be easily found for this
model.
  The ultimate aim is to get to understand real time evolution in more
complicated field theories, with quantum effects such as tunneling at finite
temperature.
