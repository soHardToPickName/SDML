Membranes on Fivebranes
</title>

<abstract>
  By analysing supersymmetry transformations we derive new BPS equations for
the D=11 fivebrane propagating in flat space that involve the world-volume
three-form. The equations generalise those of 2,3,4 and 5 dimensional special
Lagrangian submanifolds and are relevant for describing membranes ending on
these submanifolds.
