<title>
Differential Renormalization of Scalar Field Theory in the
  Background-Field Method
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce an approach for calculating the quantum loop corrections in the
$\phi^4$ theory. Differential regularization and background-field method are
essential tools and are used to calculate the effective action of the theory to
two-loop order. Our approach is considerably simpler than other known methods
and can be readily extended to higher-loop calculations and to other models.
