<title>
Are there really any AdS_2 branes in the euclidean (or not) AdS_3?
</title>

<abstract>
  We do not find any AdS_2 branes, neither in the H_3^+ WZNW model nor the
SL(2,R) WZNW model. We then reexamine the case of the branes that possess a
su(2) symmetry: we speculate that they would have to live on the boundary of
AdS_3. This cannot be realized in an euclidean spacetime, but in the SL(2,R)
WZNW model by analytical continuation.
