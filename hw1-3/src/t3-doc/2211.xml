<title>
Consistent Dirac Quantization of SU(2) Skyrmion equivalent to the BFT
  Scheme
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of Dirac quantization, the SU(2) Skyrmion is canonically
quantized to yield the modified predictions of the static properties of
baryons. We show that the energy spectrum of this Skyrmion obtained by the
Dirac method with the suggestion of generalized momenta is consistent with the
result of the Batalin-Fradkin-Tyutin formalism.
