<title>
The Quantum Algebraic Structure of the Twisted XXZ Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method with a new R-matrix
depending on two parameters $q$ and $t$. We find that the underlying algebraic
structure is the two-parameter deformed algebra $SU_{q,t}(2)$ enlarged by
introducing an element belonging to the centre. The corresponding Hamiltonian
describes the spin-1/2 XXZ model with twisted periodic boundary conditions.
