<title>
Gauge invariance for the massive axion
</title>

<abstract>
  A massive gauge invariant formulation for scalar ($\phi$) and antisymmetric
($C_{mnp}$) fields with a topological coupling, which provides a mass for the
axion field, is considered. The dual and local equivalence with the non-gauge
invariant proposal is established, but on manifolds with non-trivial
topological structure both formulations are not globally equivalent.
