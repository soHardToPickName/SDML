Trace formulas for Annuli
</title>

<abstract>
  Assuming the completeness condition for boundaries we derive trace formulas
for the annulus coefficients in 2-dimensional conformal field theory. We also
derive polynomial equations that relate the annulus, Moebius and Klein bottle
coefficients, and conjecture an annulus trace formula that is sensitive to the
orientation of the boundaries.
