Nahm Transform and Moduli Spaces of CPn Models on the Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  There is a Nahm transform for two-dimensional gauge fields which establishes
a one-to-one correspondence between the orbit space of U(N) gauge fields with
topological charge k defined on a torus and that of U(k) gauge fields with
charge N on the dual torus. The main result of this paper is to show that a
similar duality transform cannot exist for CPn instantons. This fact
establishes a significative difference between 4-D gauge theories and CPn
models. The result follows from the global analysis of the moduli space of
instantons based on a complete and explicit parametrization of all self-dual
solutions on the two-dimensional torus. The boundary of the space of regular
instantons is shown to coincide with the space of singular instantons. This
identification provides a new approach to analyzing the role of overlapping
instantons in the infrared sector of CPn sigma models.
