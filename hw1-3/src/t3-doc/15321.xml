<title>
Chern-Simons Duality and the Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  In previous work on the quantum Hall effect on an annulus, we used
$O(d,d;{\bf Z})$ duality transformations on the action describing edge
excitations to generate the Haldane hierarchy of Hall conductivities. Here we
generate the corresponding hierarchy of ``bulk actions'' which are associated
with Chern-Simons (CS) theories, the connection between the bulk and edge
arising from the requirement of anomaly cancellation. We also find a duality
transformation for the CS theory exactly analogous to the $R\rightarrow
\frac{1}{R}$ duality of the scalar field theory at the edge.
