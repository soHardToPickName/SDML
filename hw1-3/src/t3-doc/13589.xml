<title>
The Marinari-Parisi Model and Collective Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the supersymmetric collective field theory for the Marinari-Parisi
model. For a specific choice of the superpotential, to leading order we find a
one parameter family of ground states which can be connected via instantons. At
this level of analysis the instanton size implied by the underlying matrix
model does not appear.
