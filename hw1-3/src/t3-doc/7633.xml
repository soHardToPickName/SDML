Significance of the spinorial basis in relativistic quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The problems connected with a choice of the spinorial basis in the
$(j,0)\oplus (0,j)$ representation space are discussed. It is shown to have
profound significance in relativistic quantum theory. From the methodological
viewpoint this fact is related with the important dynamical role played by
space-time symmetries for all kind of interactions.
