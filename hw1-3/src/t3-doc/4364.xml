<title>
Non-extremal Stringy Black Hole
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct a four-dimensional BPS saturated heterotic string solution from
the Taub-NUT solution. It is a non-extremal black hole solution since its Euler
number is non-zero. We evaluate its black hole entropy semiclassically. We
discuss the relation between the black hole entropy and the degeneracy of
string states. The entropy of our string solution can be understood as the
microscopic entropy which counts the elementary string states without any
complications.
