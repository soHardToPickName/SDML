<title>
Tube Model for Light-Front QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose the tube model as a first step in solving the bound state problem
in light-front QCD. In this approach we neglect transverse variations of the
fields, producing a model with 1+1 dimensional dynamics. We then solve the two,
three, and four particle sectors of the model for the case of pure glue SU(3).
We study convergence to the continuum limit and various properties of the
spectrum.
