<title>
Exact Solutions of G-Invariant Chiral Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a methodology for solving the chiral equations $(\alpha g_{,z}
g^{-1})_{,\overline z} + (\alpha g_{,\overline z} g^{-1})_{,z} \ = \ 0 $ where
$g$ belongs to some Lie group $G$. The solutions are writing in terms of
Harmonic maps. The method could be used even for some infinite Lie groups.
