<title>
A pedestrian approach to the high energy limits of branes and other
  gravitational systems
</title>

<abstract>
  In this article we study limits of models that contain a dimensionful
parameter such as the mass of the relativistic point-particle. The limits are
analogous to the massless limit of the particle and may be thought of as high
energy limits. We present the ideas and work through several examples in a
(hopefully) pedagogical manner. Along the way we derive several new results.
