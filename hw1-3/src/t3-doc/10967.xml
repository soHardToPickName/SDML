<title>
From N=2 Supergravity to Constrained Moduli Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  In this talk we review some results concerning a mechanism for reducing the
moduli space of a topological field theory to a proper submanifold of the
ordinary moduli space. Such mechanism is explicitly realized in the example of
constrained topological gravity, obtained by topologically twisting the N=2
Liouville theory.
