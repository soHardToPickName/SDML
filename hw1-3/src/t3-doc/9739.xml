<title>
Duality of Non-Supersymmetric Large N Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from Seiberg's electric-magnetic duality for supersymmetric QCD, we
construct dual pairs of non-supersymmetric gauge theories. This is accomplished
by first taking the large N limit of supersymmetric QCD and its dual partner
and then performing a special ``orbifold projection'' recently introduced by
Kachru and Silverstein. We argue that in the large N limit the two projected
theories remain dual. The non-supersymmetric gauge theories which can be
studied in this fashion have non-supersymmetric field content, chiral fermions
and exactly massless scalar matter.
