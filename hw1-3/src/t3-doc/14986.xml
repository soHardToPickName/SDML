Conformal Symmetry on World Volumes of Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how the anti-de Sitter isometries of a brane solution of supergravity
theory produce superconformal invariance of their world-volume action. In this
way linear as well as non-linear superconformal actions are obtained in various
dimensions. Two particular examples are a conformal action with the
antisymmetric tensor in 6 dimensions in Pasti-Sorokin-Tonin formulation, and
superconformal mechanics.
