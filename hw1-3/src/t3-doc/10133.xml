Friedmann equation and Cardy formula correspondence in brane universes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the brane with arbitrary tension $\sigma$ on the edge of various
black holes with AdS asymptotics. We investigate Friedmann equations governing
the motion of the brane universes and match the Friedmann equation to Cardy
entropy formula.
