A Technique for Calculating Quantum Corrections to Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a numerical scheme for calculating the first quantum corrections
to the properties of static solitons. The technique is applicable to solitons
of arbitrary shape, and may be used in 3+1 dimensions for multiskyrmions or
other complicated solitons. We report on a test computation in 1+1 dimensions,
where we accurately reproduce the analytical result with minimal numerical
effort.
