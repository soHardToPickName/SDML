<title>
Noncommutative Chiral Anomaly and the Dirac-Ginsparg-Wilson Operator
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that local axial anomaly in $2-$dimensions emerges naturally in
the {\it gauge-invariant quantized} Ginsparg-Wilson relation if one postulates
an underlying noncommutative structure of spacetime . Indeed if one first
regularizes the $2-$d plane with a fuzzy sphere, i.e with a $(2l+1)
{\times}(2l+1)$ matrix model, then one immediately finds that the
gauge-invariant Dirac operator $D_{GF}$ is different from the chiral-invariant
Dirac operator $D_{CF}$ . The fact that gauge states are different from chiral
states stems from the free noncommutative Dirac operator $D_F$ which is found
to be inconsistent with chiral symmetry at high frequencies . Furthermore it
splits such that $\frac{1}{D_F}={\theta}{\Gamma}^R+\frac{1} {D_{\Lambda}}$
where $\theta=\frac{1}{2l+1}$ is the noncommutativity parameter, ${\Gamma}^R$
is the noncommutative chirality and $D_{\Lambda}$ is identified as the correct
Dirac operator on this matrix model . $D_{\Lambda}$ has essentially the same IR
spectrum as $D_{F}$, both operators share the same continuum limit yet
$D_{\Lambda}$ is consistent with chiral symmetry on the UV modes . The second
step of this fuzzy regularization consists simply of approximating the exact
Dirac operator $D_{F}$ with $D_{\Lambda}$ . This regularization is shown to be
gauge-invariant and yields to an anomaly which in terms of Dirac operators
depends only on the difference $\frac{1}{D_F}-\frac{1}{D_{\Lambda}}$ . Although
the difference ${\theta}{\Gamma}^R$ drops from the spectrum in the limit, its
contribution to the variation of the measure is shown to be not zero, it gives
exactly the canonical anomaly .
