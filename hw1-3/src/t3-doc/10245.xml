Some Physical Aspects of Liouville String Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss some physical aspects of our Liouville approach to non-critical
strings, including the emergence of a microscopic arrow of time, effective
field theories as classical ``pointer'' states in theory space, $CPT$ violation
and the possible apparent non-conservation of angular momentum. We also review
the application of a phenomenological parametrization of this formalism to the
neutral kaon system.
