Probe Branes Dynamics: Exact Solutions in General Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider probe p-branes and Dp-branes dynamics in D-dimensional string
theory backgrounds of general type. Unified description for the tensile and
tensionless branes is used. We obtain exact solutions of their equations of
motion and constraints in static gauge as well as in more general gauges. Their
dynamics in the whole space-time is also analysed and exact solutions are
found.
