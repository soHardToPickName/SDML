<title>
A Model of Two-Dimensional Quantum Gravity in the Strong Coupling Regime
</title>

<abstract>
  A model of two-dimensional quantum gravity that is the analog of the
tensionless string is proposed. The gravitational constant ($k$) is the analog
of the Regge slope ($\alpha^{'}$) and it shows that when $k \rightarrow
\infty$, $2D$ quantum gravity can be understood as a tensionless string theory
embeded in a two-dimensional target space. The temporal coordinate of the
target space play the role of time and the wave function can be interpreted as
in standard quantum mechanics.
