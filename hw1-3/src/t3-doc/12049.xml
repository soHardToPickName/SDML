<title>
On a different BRST constructions for a given Lie algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  The method of the BRST quantization is considered for the system of
constraints, which form a Lie algebra. When some of the Cartan generators do
not imply any conditions on the physical states, the system contains the first
and the second class constraints. After the introduction auxiliary bosonic
degrees of freedom for these cases, the corresponding BRST charges with the
nontrivial structure of nonlinear terms in ghosts are constructed.
