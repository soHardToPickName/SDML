Topological Charge of U(1) Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-singular instantons are shown to exist on noncommutative R^4 even with a
U(1) gauge group. Their existence is primarily due to the noncommutativity of
the space. The relation between U(1) instantons on noncommutative R^4 and the
projection operators acting on the representation space of the noncommutative
coordinates is reviewed. The integer number of instantons on the noncommutative
R^4 can be understood as the winding number of the U(1) gauge field as well as
the dimension of the projection on the representation space.
