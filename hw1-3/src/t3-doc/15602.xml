<title>
Projection Operator Approach to Constrained Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently, within the context of the phase space coherent state path integral
quantisation of constrained systems, John Klauder introduced a reproducing
kernel for gauge invariant physical states, which involves a projection
operator onto the reduced Hilbert space of physical states, avoids any gauge
fixing conditions, and leads to a specific measure for the integration over
Lagrange multipliers. Here, it is pointed out that this approach is also devoid
of any Gribov problems and always provides for an effectively admissible
integration over all gauge orbits of gauge invariant systems. This important
aspect of Klauder's proposal is explicitly confirmed by two simple examples.
