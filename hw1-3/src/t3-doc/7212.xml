<title>
General solutions of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation in $n$-dimensional
  space
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the general solution of a homogeneous Monge-Amp\`{e}re
equation in $n$-dimensional space is closely connected with the exactly
(but only implicitly) integrable system
  \frac {\partial \xi_{j}}{\partial x_0}+\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}
\xi_{k} \frac {\partial \xi_{j}}{\partial x_{k}}=0 \label{1}
  Using the explicit form of solution of this system it is possible to
construct the general solution of the Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation.
