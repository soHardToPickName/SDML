<title>
Confined Maxwell Field and Temperature Inversion Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We evaluate the Casimir vacuum energy at finite temperature associated with
the Maxwell field confined by a perfectly conducting rectangular cavity and
show that an extended version of the temperature inversion symmetry is present
in this system.
