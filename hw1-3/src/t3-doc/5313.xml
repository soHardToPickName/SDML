Free field representations for the affine superalgebra sl(2|1)
</title>

<abstract>
  Free field representations of the affine superalgebra $A(1,0)^{(1)}$ at level
$k$ are needed in the description of the noncritical $N=2$ string. The
superalgebra admits two inequivalent choices of simple roots. We give the
Wakimoto representations corresponding to each of these and derive the relation
between the two at the quantum level.
