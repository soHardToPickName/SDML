IIA string instanton corrections to the four-fermion correlator in the
  intersection of Del Pezzo surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The Becker-Becker-Strominger formula, describing the string world-sheet
instanton corrections to the four-fermion correlator in the Calabi-Yau
compactified type-IIA superstrings, is calculated in the special case of the
Calabi-Yau threefold realized in the intersection of two Del Pezzo surfaces. We
also derive the selection rules in the supersymmetric GUT of the Pati-Salam
type associated with our construction.
