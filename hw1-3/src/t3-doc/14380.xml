<title>
Uniqueness and non-uniqueness of static black holes in higher dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove a uniqueness theorem for asymptotically flat static charged dilaton
black hole solutions in higher dimensional space-times. We also construct
infinitely many non-asymptotically flat regular static black holes on the same
space-time manifold with the same spherical topology. An application to the
uniqueness of a certain class of flat $p$-branes is also given.
