<title>
Free Fermionic Elliptic Reflection Matrices and Quantum Group Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  Elliptic diagonal solutions for the reflection matrices associated to the
elliptic $R$ matrix of the eight vertex free fermion model are presented. They
lead through the second derivative of the open chain transfer matrix to an XY
hamiltonian in a magnetic field which is invariant under a quantum deformed
Clifford--Hopf algebra.
