<title>
Twisted Moduli Stabilization in Type I String Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the model with the dilaton and twisted moduli fields, which is
inspired by type I string models. Stabilization of their vacuum expectation
values is studied. We find the stabilization of the twisted moduli field has
different aspects from the dilaton stabilization.
