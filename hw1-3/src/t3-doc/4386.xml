<title>
Nonequivalent representations of nuclear algebras of canonical
  commutation relations. Quantum fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-Fock representations of the canonical commutation relations modeled over
an infinite-dimensional nuclear space are constructed in an explicit form. The
example of the nuclear space of smooth real functions of rapid decrease results
in nonequivalent quantizations of scalar fields.
