<title>
The Mass Spectrum of the 2-dimensional Conformal String
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the mass spectrum of the tensionless string in 2 dimensions where
it has been found that the space time conformal symmetry survives quantization.
A BRST treatment of the physical states reveals that the string collapses into
a massless particle, a result which agrees with the classical treatment.
