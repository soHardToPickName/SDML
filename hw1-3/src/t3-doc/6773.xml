Magnetic Monopoles with Wilson loops on a 5D Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss magnetic monopoles in gauge theories with Wilson loops on
orbifolds. We present a simple example in 5 dimensions with the fifth dimension
compactified on an S^1/Z_2 orbifold. The Wilson loop in this SO(3) example
replaces the adjoint Higgs scalar (needed to break SO(3) to U(1)) in the
well-known 't Hooft - Polyakov construction. Our solution is a magnetic
monopole string with finite energy, and length equal to the size of the extra
dimension.
