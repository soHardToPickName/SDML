<title>
Four-dimensional integration by parts with differential renormalization
  as a method of evaluation of Feynman diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how strictly four-dimensional integration by parts combined with
differential renormalization and its infrared analogue can be applied for
calculation of Feynman diagrams.
