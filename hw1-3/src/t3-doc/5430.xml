<title>
An alternative BRST operator for topological Landau-Ginzburg models
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a new BRST operator for the B-twist of $N=2$ Landau-Ginzburg (LG)
models. It solves the problem of the fractional ghost numbers of Vafa's old
BRST operator and shows how the model is obtained by gauge fixing a zero
action. An essential role is played by the anti-BRST operator,which is given by
one of the supersymmetries of the $N=2$ algebra. Its presence is needed in
proving that the model is indeed a topological field theory. The space of
physical observables, defined by taking the anti-BRST cohomology in the BRST
cohomology groups, is unchanged.
