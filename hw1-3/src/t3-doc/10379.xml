Boundary Reflection Matrix in Perturbative Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study boundary reflection matrix for the quantum field theory defined on a
half line using Feynman's perturbation theory. The boundary reflection matrix
can be extracted directly from the two-point correlation function. This enables
us to determine the boundary reflection matrix for affine Toda field theory
with the Neumann boundary condition modulo `a mysterious factor half'.
