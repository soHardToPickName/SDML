Gauging Higher Derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
The usual prescription for constructing gauge-invariant Lagrangian is
generalized to the case where a Lagrangian contains second derivatives of
fields as well as first derivatives. Symmetric tensor fields in addition to the
usual vector fields are introduced as gauge fields. Covariant derivatives and
gauge-field strengths are determined.
