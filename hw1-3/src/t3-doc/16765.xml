<title>
Partial summation of the nonlocal expansion for the gravitational
  effective action in 4 dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuum action for the gravitational field admits a known expansion in
powers of the Ricci tensor with nonlocal operator coefficients (form factors).
We show that going over to a different basis of curvature invariants makes
possible a partial summation of this expansion. Only the form factors of the
Weyl-tensor invariants need be calculated. The full action is then uniquely
recovered to all orders from the knowledge of the trace anomaly. We present an
explicit expression for the partially summed action, and point out
simplifications resulting in the vertex functions. An application to the effect
of the vacuum gravitational waves is discussed.
