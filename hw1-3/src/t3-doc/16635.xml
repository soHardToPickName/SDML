Causal Approach to Supersymmetry: Chiral Superfields
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct quantized free superfields and represent them as operator-valued
distributions in Fock space starting with Majorana fields. The perturbative
construction of the S-matrix for interacting theories is carried through by
extending the causal method of Epstein and Glaser to superspace. We propose a
scaling and singular order of distributions in superspace by a procedure which
scales both commutative and non-commutative variables. Using this singular
order the chiral (Wess-Zumino) model appears to be super-renormalizable.
