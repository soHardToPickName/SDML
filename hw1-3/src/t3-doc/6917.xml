<title>
On The Interpolating Solutions of Strings in Different Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the beta-function equations for string theory in the case when the
target space has one spacelike (or timelike) direction and rest is some
conformal field theory (CFT) with appropriate central charge and has one nearly
marginal operator. We show there always exists a space (time) dependent
solution which interpolates between the original background and the background
where CFT is replaced by a new conformal field theory, obtained by perturbing
CFT by the nearly marginal operator.
