Axial Monopoles, The Quantization of Electric Charge and a Dynamical
  Discreteness of Space-Time
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present contribution we show that the introduction of a conserved
axial current in electrodynamics can explain the quantization of electric
charge, preserving parity conservation, and introduces a dynamical discreteness
into space-time.
