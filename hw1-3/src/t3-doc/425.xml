String Dualities from Matrix Theory: A Summary
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the appearance, within Matrix theory, of the $SL(5,Z)$ U-duality
group of M-theory on $T^4$, and the duality between M-theory on K3 and the
Heterotic string on $T^3$. In both cases the duality is geometrical and
manifest.
