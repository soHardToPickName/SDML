Time Asymmetric Quantum Theory - II. Relativistic Resonances from
  S-Matrix Poles
</title>

<abstract>
  Relativistic resonances and decaying states are described by representations
of Poincar\'e transformations, similar to Wigner's definition of stable
particles. To associate decaying state vectors to resonance poles of the
$S$-matrix, the conventional Hilbert space assumption (or asymptotic
completeness) is replaced by a new hypothesis that associates different dense
Hardy subspaces to the in- and out-scattering states. Then one can separate the
scattering amplitude into a background amplitude and one or several
``relativistic Breit-Wigner'' amplitudes, which represent the resonances per
se. These Breit-Wigner amplitudes have a precisely defined lineshape and are
associated to exponentially decaying Gamow vectors which furnish the
irreducible representation spaces of causal Poincar\'e transformations into the
forward light cone.
