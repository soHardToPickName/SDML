U(1,1)--Invariant Generation of Charges for
  Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The action of the isometry subgroup which preserves the trivial values of the
fields is studied for the stationary D=4 Einstein--Maxwell--Dilaton--Axion
theory. The technique for generation of charges and the corresponding procedure
for construction of new solutions is formulated. A solution describing the
double rotating dyon with independent values of all physical charges is
presented.
