<title>
N-point and higher-genus osp(1|2) fusion
</title>

<abstract>
  We study affine osp(1|2) fusion, the fusion in osp(1|2) conformal field
theory, for example. Higher-point and higher-genus fusion is discussed. The
fusion multiplicities are characterized as discretized volumes of certain
convex polytopes, and are written explicitly as multiple sums measuring those
volumes. We extend recent methods developed to treat affine su(2) fusion. They
are based on the concept of generalized Berenstein-Zelevinsky triangles and
virtual couplings. Higher-point tensor products of finite-dimensional
irreducible osp(1|2) representations are also considered. The associated
multiplicities are computed and written as multiple sums.
