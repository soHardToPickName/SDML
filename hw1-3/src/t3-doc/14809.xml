Solution of the dispersionless Hirota equations
</title>

<abstract>
  The dispersionless differential Fay identity is shown to be equivalent to a
kernel expansion providing a universal algebraic characterization and solution
of the dispersionless Hirota equations. Some calculations based on D-bar data
of the action are also indicated.
