BPS Conditions of Supermembrane on the PP-wave
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the BPS conditions in the closed supermembranes on the maximally
supersymmetric pp-wave background. In particular, the 1/2 and 1/4 BPS states
are discussed in detail. Moreover, we comment on the zero-modes in the
invariant mass formulae of the theory.
