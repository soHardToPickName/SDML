Microscopic- versus Effective Coupling in N=2 Yang-Mills With Four
  Flavours
</title>

<abstract>
  We determine the instanton corrections to the effective coupling in SU(2),
N=2 Yang-Mills theory with four flavours to all orders. Our analysis uses the
S(2,Z)-invariant curve and the two instanton contribution obtained earlier to
fix the higher order contributions uniquely.
