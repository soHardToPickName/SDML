Black Hole entropy by the brick wall method in four and five dimensions
  with U(1) charges
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the brick wall method we compute the statistical entropy of a scalar
field in a nontrivial background, in two different cases. These background are
generated by four and five dimensional black holes with four and three U(1)
charges respectively. The Bekenstein entropy formula is generally obeyed, but
corrections are discussed in the latter case.
