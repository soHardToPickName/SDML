<title>
Open string models with Scherk-Schwarz SUSY breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply the well-known Scherk-Schwarz supersymmetry breaking mechanism in an
open string context. We construct a new Z_3\times Z_3^\prime model, containing
only D9-branes, and rederive from a more geometric perspective the known
Z_6^\prime\times Z_2^\prime model, containing D9, D5 and \bar D 5 branes. We
show recent results about the study of quantum instability of these models.
