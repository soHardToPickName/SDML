<title>
Exact Solutions in Bosonic and Heterotic String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some exact solitonic solutions of string theory with
higher-membrane structure. These include an axionic instanton solution of
bosonic string theory as well as multi-instanton and multimonopole solutions of
heterotic string theory. The heterotic solutions reveal some interesting
aspects of string theory as a theory of quantum gravity.
