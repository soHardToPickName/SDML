Meanders: A Direct Enumeration Approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the statistics of semi-meanders, i.e. configurations of a set of
roads crossing a river through n bridges, and possibly winding around its
source, as a toy model for compact folding of polymers. By analyzing the
results of a direct enumeration up to n=29, we perform on the one hand a large
n extrapolation and on the other hand we reformulate the available data into a
large q expansion, where q is a weight attached to each road. We predict a
transition at q=2 between a low-q regime with irrelevant winding, and a large-q
regime with relevant winding.
