Constant field strengths on T^{2n}
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyse field strength configurations in U(N) Yang-Mills theory on T^{2n}
that are diagonal and constant, extending early work of Van Baal on T^4. The
spectrum of fluctuations is determined and the eigenfunctions are given
explicitly in terms of theta functions on tori. We show the relevance of the
analysis to higher dimensional D-branes and discuss applications of the results
in string theory.
