Some Navigation Rules for D-Brane Monodromy
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore some aspects of monodromies of D-branes in the Kahler moduli space
of Calabi-Yau compactifications. Here a D-brane is viewed as an object of the
derived category of coherent sheaves. We compute all the interesting
monodromies in some nontrivial examples and link our work to recent results and
conjectures concerning helices and mutations. We note some particular
properties of the 0-brane.
