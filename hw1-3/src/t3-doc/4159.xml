Phases of Thermal Super Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the thermodynamics of the confined and unconfined phases of
superconformal Yang-Mills at large N on a three-sphere, focussing especially on
the confinement-deconfinement transition. We determine an N-dependent phase
boundary and point out some directions for future work.
