<title>
Noncommutative differential geometry with higher order derivatives
</title>

<abstract>
  We build a toy model of differential geometry on the real line, which
includes derivatives of the second order. Such construction is possible only
within the framework of noncommutative geometry. We introduce the metric and
briefly discuss two simple physical models of scalar field theory and gauge
theory in this geometry.
