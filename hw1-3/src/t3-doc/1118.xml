Cosmic String Production Towards the End of Brane Inflation
</title>

<abstract>
  Towards the end of the brane inflationary epoch in the brane world, cosmic
strings (but not texture, domain walls or monopoles) are copiously produced
during brane collision. These cosmic strings are D$p$-branes with $(p-1)$
dimensions compactified. We elaborate on this prediction of the superstring
theory description of the brane world. Using the data on the temperature
anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, we estimate the cosmic string
tension $\mu$ to be around $G \mu \simeq 10^{-7}$. This in turn implies that
the anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background comes mostly from inflation,
but with a component (of order 10%) from cosmic strings. This cosmic string
effect should also be observable in gravitational wave detectors and maybe even
pulsar timing measurements.
