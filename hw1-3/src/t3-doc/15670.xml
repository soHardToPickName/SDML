<title>
The Quantum Geometer's Universe: Particles, Interactions and Topology
</title>

<abstract>
  With the two most profound conceptual revolutions of XXth century physics,
quantum mechanics and relativity, which have culminated into relativistic
spacetime geometry and quantum gauge field theory as the principles for gravity
and the three other known fundamental interactions, the physicist of the XXIst
century has inherited an unfinished symphony: the unification of the quantum
and the continuum. As an invitation to tomorrow's quantum geometers who must
design the new rulers by which to size up the Universe at those scales where
the smallest meets the largest, these lectures review the basic principles of
today's conceptual framework, and highlight by way of simple examples the
interplay that presently exists between the quantum world of particle
interactions and the classical world of geometry and topology.
