Differential Calculi on h-deformed Bosonic and Fermionic Quantum Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study differential calculus on h-deformed bosonic and fermionic quantum
space. It is shown that the fermionic quantum space involves a parafermionic
variable as well as a classical fermionic one. Further we construct the
classical $su(2)$ algebra on the fermionic quantum space and discuss a mapping
between the classical $su(2)$ and the h-deformed $su(2)$ algebras.
