<title>
Spin zero particle propagator from a random walk in 3-D space
</title>

<abstract>
  The propagator of a spin zero particle in coordinate space is derived
supposing that the particle propagates rectilinearly always at the speed of
light and changes its direction in some random points due to a scattering
process.The average path between two scatterings is of the order of the Compton
length.
