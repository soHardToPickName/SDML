String theory as a universal language
</title>

<abstract>
  This article, based on the Klein lecture, contains some new results and new
speculations on various topics. They include discussion of open strings in the
AdS space, unusual features of D-branes, conformal gauge theories in higher
dimensions. We also comment on the infrared screening of the cosmological
constant and on the "brane worlds"
