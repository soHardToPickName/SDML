<title>
Geometric quantization on homogeneous spaces and the meaning of
  `inequivalent' quantizations
</title>

<abstract>
  Consideration of the geometric quantization of the phase space of a particle
in an external Yang-Mills field allows the results of the Mackey-Isham
quantization procedure for homogeneous configuration spaces to be
reinterpreted. In particular, a clear physical interpretation of the
`inequivalent' quantizations occurring in that procedure is given.
