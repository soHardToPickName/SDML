On $(k\oplus l |q)$-dimensional supermanifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We define a $(k\oplus l|q)$-dimensional supermanifold as a manifold having q
odd coordinates and k + l even coordinates with l of them taking only nilpotent
values. We show that this notion can be used to formulate superconformal field
theories with different number of supersymmetries in holomorphic and
antiholomorphic sectors.
