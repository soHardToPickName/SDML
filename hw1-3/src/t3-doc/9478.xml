Noncommutative Yang-Mills in IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that twisted reduced models can be interpreted as noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory. Based upon this correspondence, we obtain noncommutative
Yang-Mills theory with D-brane backgrounds in IIB matrix model. We propose that
IIB matrix model with D-brane backgrounds serve as a concrete definition of
noncommutative Yang-Mills. We investigate D-instanton solutions as local
excitations on D3-branes. When instantons overlap, their interaction can be
well described in gauge theory and AdS/CFT correspondence. We show that IIB
matrix model gives us the consistent potential with IIB supergravity when they
are well separated.
