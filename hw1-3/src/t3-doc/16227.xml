<title>
Special geometry and perturbative analysis of $N=2$ heterotic vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  The requirement of target-space duality and the use of nonrenormalization
theorems lead to strong constraints on the perturbative prepotential that
encodes the low-energy effective action of $N=2$ heterotic superstring vacua.
The analysis is done in the context of special geometry, which governs the
couplings of the vector multiplets. The presentation is kept at an introductory
level.
