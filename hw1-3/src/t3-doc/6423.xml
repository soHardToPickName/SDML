<title>
Duality between Topologically Massive and Self-Dual models
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that, with the help of a general BRST symmetry, different theories in
3 dimensions can be connected through a fundamental topological field theory
related to the classical limit of the Chern-Simons model.
