<title>
Some new integrable equations from the self-dual Yang-Mills equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the symmetry reductions of the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations in
(2+2) dimensions, we introduce new integrable equations which are nonautonomous
versions of the chiral model in (2+1) dimensions, generalized nonlinear
Schrodinger, Korteweg-de Vries, Toda lattice, Garnier and Euler-Arnold
equations. The Lax pairs for all of these equations are derived by the symmetry
reductions of the Lax pair for the SDYM equations.
