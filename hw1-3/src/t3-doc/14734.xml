Dp-brane Tension from Tachyons and B-field in Vacuum String Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider tachyonic string-field fluctuations about a Dp-brane background
in the geometrical (CFT) formulation of Vacuum String Field Theory. We then
extend this analysis to the case of a background B-field. We find that the
standard results for D-brane tension are reproduced in both cases.
