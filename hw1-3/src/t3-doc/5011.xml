<title>
Algebraic renormalization of the BF Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the quantum equivalence, to all orders of perturbation theory,
between the Yang-Mills theory and its first order formulation through a second
rank antisymmetric tensor field. Moreover, the introduction of an additional
nonphysical vector field allows us to interpret the Yang-Mills theory as a kind
of perturbation of the topological BF model.
