Rotating membranes on G_2 manifolds, logarithmic anomalous dimensions
  and N=1 duality
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the $E-S \sim \log S$ behaviour found for long strings rotating
on $AdS_5\times S^5$ may be reproduced by membranes rotating on $AdS_4\times
S^7$ and on a warped $AdS_5$ M-theory solution. We go on to obtain rotating
membrane configurations with the same $E-K \sim \log K$ relation on $G_2$
holonomy backgrounds that are dual to ${\mathcal{N}}=1$ gauge theories in four
dimensions. We study membrane configurations on $G_2$ holonomy backgrounds
systematically, finding various other Energy-Charge relations. We end with some
comments about strings rotating on warped backgrounds.
