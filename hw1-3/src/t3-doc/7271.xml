Quantum Gravitational Corrections to the Nonrelativistic Scattering
  Potential of Two Masses
</title>

<abstract>
  We treat general relativity as an effective field theory, obtaining the full
nonanalytic component of the scattering matrix potential to one-loop order. The
lowest order vertex rules for the resulting effective field theory are
presented and the one-loop diagrams which yield the leading nonrelativistic
post-Newtonian and quantum corrections to the gravitational scattering
amplitude to second order in G are calculated in detail. The Fourier
transformed amplitudes yield a nonrelativistic potential and our result is
discussed in relation to previous calculations. The definition of a potential
is discussed as well and we show how the ambiguity of the potential under
coordinate changes is resolved.
