Membrane Scattering with M-Momentum Transfer
</title>

<abstract>
  Membrane scattering in m(atrix) theory is related to dynamics in
three-dimensional $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with transfer of $p^{11}$ being an
instanton process. We calculate the instanton amplitude and find precise
agreement with the amplitude in eleven dimensional supergravity.
