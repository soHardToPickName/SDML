<title>
Entropy, String Theory, and our World
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the consequences of two assumptions for String (or M) Theory,
namely that: 1) all coordinates are compact and bound by the horizon of
observation, 2) the ``dynamics'' of compactification is determined by the
``second law of thermodynamics'', i.e. the principle of entropy. We discuss how
this leads to a phenomenologically consistent scenario for our world, both at
the elementary particle's and at the cosmological level, without any fine
tuning or further ``ad hoc'' constraint.
