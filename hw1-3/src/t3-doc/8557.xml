The Gravitational Action in Asymptotically AdS and Flat Spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  The divergences of the gravitational action are analyzed for spacetimes that
are asymptotically anti-de Sitter and asymptotically flat. The gravitational
action is rendered finite using a local counterterm prescription, and the
relation of this method to the traditional reference spacetime is discussed.
For AdS, an iterative procedure is devised that determines the counterterms
efficiently. For asymptotically flat space, we use a different method to derive
counterterms which are sufficient to remove divergences in most cases.
