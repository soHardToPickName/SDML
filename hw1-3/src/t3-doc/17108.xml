<title>
$S$-Duality and $H$-Monopoles
</title>

<abstract>
  The spectrum of $H$-monopoles of the heterotic string compactified on a six
torus and its relationship to the $S$-duality conjecture is briefly reviewed.
It is based on work done in collaboration with J. Harvey and is a contribution
to the proceedings of Strings '95, USC, March 1995.
