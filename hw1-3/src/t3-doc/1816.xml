VEV's and condensates from the Schr\"odinger Wave-functional
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how VEV's and condensates can be read off from the Schr\"odinger
wave-functional without further calculation. This allows us to study
non-perturbative physics by solving the Schr\"odinger equation. To illustrate
the method we calculate fermion condensates from the exact solution of the
Schwinger model, and other (1+1) dimensional models. The chiral condensate is
seen to be a large-distance effect due to propagators reflecting off the
space-time boundary.
