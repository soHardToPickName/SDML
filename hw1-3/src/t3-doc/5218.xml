<title>
Quantum Myers effect and its supergravity dual for D0/D4 systems
</title>

<abstract>
  The presence of a distant D4-brane is used to further investigate the duality
between M-theory and D0-brane quantum mechanics. A polarization of the quantum
mechanical ground state is found. A similar deformation arises for the bubble
of normal space found near D0-branes in classical supergravity solutions. These
deformations are compared and are shown to have the same structure in each
case.
