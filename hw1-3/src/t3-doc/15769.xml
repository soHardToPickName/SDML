Large N Field Theory of N=2 Strings and Self-Dual Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some aspects of the construction of self-dual gravity and the
associated field theory of ${\cal N}=2$ strings in terms of two-dimensional
sigma models at large $N$. The theory is defined through a large $N$
Wess-Zumino-Witten model in a nontrivial background and in a particular double
scaling limit. We examine the canonical structure of the theory and describe an
infinite-dimensional Poisson algebra of currents.
