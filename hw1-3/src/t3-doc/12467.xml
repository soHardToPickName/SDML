<title>
de Sitter black hole with a conformally coupled scalar field in four
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A four-dimensional black hole solution of the Einstein equations with a
positive cosmological constant, coupled to a conformal scalar field, is given.
There is a curvature singularity at the origin, and scalar field diverges
inside the event horizon. The electrically charged solution, which has a fixed
charge-to-mass ratio is also found. The quartic self-interacting coupling
becomes bounded in terms of Newton's and the cosmological constants.
