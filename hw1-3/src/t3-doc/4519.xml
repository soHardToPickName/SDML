Quintessence and Brane world scenarios
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility of quintessence in the dilatonic domain walls
including the Randall-Sundrum brane world. We obtain the zero mode effective
action for gravitating objects in the dilatonic domain wall. First we consider
the four dimensional (4D) gravity and the Brans-Dicke graviscalar with a
potential. This can be further rewritten as a minimally coupled scalar with the
Liouville-type potential in the Einstein frame. However this model fails to
induce the quintessence on the dilatonic domain wall because the potential is
negative. Second we consider the 4D gravity with the dilaton. In this case we
find also a negative potential. Any negative potential gives us negative energy
density and positive pressure, which does not lead to an accelerating universe.
Consequently it turns out that the zero mode approach of the dilatonic domain
wall cannot accommodate the quintessence in cosmology.
