<title>
On the Strong Coupling Dynamics of heterotic string theory on C^3/Z_3
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the strong coupling dynamics of the heterotic E_8 x E_8 string
theory on the orbifolds T^6/Z_3 and C^3/Z_3 using the duality with the
Horava-Witten M-theory picture.
 This leads us to a conjecture about the low energy description of the five
dimensional E_0-theory (the CFT that describes the the singularity region of
M-theory on C^3/Z_3) compactified on S^1/Z_2.
