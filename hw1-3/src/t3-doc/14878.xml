1+1 Dimensional Yang-Mills Theories in Light-Cone Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In 1+1 dimensions two different formulations exist of SU(N) Yang Mills
theories in light-cone gauge; only one of them gives results which comply with
the ones obtained in Feynman gauge. Moreover the theory, when considered in
1+(D-1) dimensions, looks discontinuous in the limit D=2. All those features
are proven in Wilson loop calculations as well as in the study of the $q\bar q$
bound state integral equation in the large N limit.
