Black Hole Radiation (with and) without Weyl Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  In the semiclassical analysis of black hole radiation in matter-coupled
dilaton gravity, a one-parameter ``$k$"-family of measures for the path
integral quantization of the matter fields is considered. The Weyl anomaly is
proportional to the parameter $k$, but the black hole radiation seen by
minkowskian observers at future null infinity is $k$-independent.
