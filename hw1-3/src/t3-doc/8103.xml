<title>
Gauge Theoretic Approach to Fluid Dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  The Hamiltonian dynamics of a compressible inviscid fluid is formulated as a
gauge theory. The idea of gauge equivalence is exploited to unify the study of
apparantly distinct physical problems and solutions of new models can be
generated from known fluid velocity profiles.
