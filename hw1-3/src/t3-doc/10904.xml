Highest Weight $U_q[sl(n)]$ Modules and Invariant Integrable n-State
  Models with Periodic Boundary Conditions"
</title>

<abstract>
  The weights are computed for the Bethe vectors of an RSOS type model with
periodic boundary conditions obeying $U_q[sl(n)]$ ($q=\exp(i\pi/r)$)
invariance. They are shown to be highest weight vectors. The q-dimensions of
the corresponding irreducible representations are obtained.
