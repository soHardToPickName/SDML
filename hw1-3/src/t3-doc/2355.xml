<title>
Partition Functions for Heterotic WZW Conformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Thus far in the search for, and classification of, `physical' modular
invariant partition functions $\sum N_{LR}\,\c_L\,\C_R$ the attention has been
focused on the {\it symmetric} case where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
sectors, and hence the characters $\c_L$ and $\c_R$, are associated with the
same Kac-Moody algebras $\g_L=\g_R$ and levels $k_L=k_R$. In this paper we
consider the more general possibility where $(\g_L,k_L)$ may not equal
$(\g_R,k_R)$. We discuss which choices of algebras and levels may correspond to
well-defined conformal field theories, we find the `smallest' such {\it
heterotic} (\ie asymmetric) partition functions, and we give a method,
generalizing the Roberts-Terao-Warner lattice method, for explicitly
constructing many other modular invariants. We conclude the paper by proving
that this new lattice method will succeed in generating all the heterotic
partition functions, for all choices of algebras and levels.
