<title>
Weak Scale in Heterotic String
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the possibility of lowering the string scale in four
dimensional heterotic models possessing a non-perturbative extension of the
gauge group. In particular, we consider a class of compactifications in which
the perturbative gauge sector is massive, and all the gauge bosons are
non-perturbative, with a coupling independent on the Planck and string scales.
