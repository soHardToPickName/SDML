Brane worlds
</title>

<abstract>
  This is an introductory review of gravity on branes with an emphasis on
codimension 1 models. However, for a new result it is also pointed out that the
cosmological evolution of the 3-brane in the model of Dvali, Gabadadze and
Porrati may follow the standard Friedmann equation.
