Universal Massive Spectral Correlators and QCD_3
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on random matrix theory in the unitary ensemble, we derive the
double-microscopic massive spectral correlators corresponding to the Dirac
operator of QCD_3 with an even number of fermions N_f. We prove that these
spectral correlators are universal, and demonstrate that they satisfy exact
massive spectral sum rules of QCD_3 in a phase where flavor symmetries are
spontaneously broken according to U(N_f) -> U(N_f/2) x U(N_f/2).
