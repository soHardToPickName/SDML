STRINGS IN COSMOLOGICAL SPACETIMES AND THEIR BACK-REACTION
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short review on strings in curved spacetimes. We start by recalling
the classical and quantum string behaviour in singular plane waves backgrounds.
We then report on the string behaviour in cosmological spacetimes (FRW, de
Sitter, power inflation) which is by now largerly understood. Recent progress
on self-consistent solutions to the Einstein equations for string dominated
universes is reviewed. The energy-momentum tensor for a gas of strings is
considered as source of the spacetime geometry. The string equation of state is
determined from the behaviour of the explicit string solutions. This yields a
self-consistent cosmological solution exhibiting realistic matter dominated
behaviour $ R \sim (T)^{2/3}\; $ for large times and radiation dominated
behaviour $ R \sim (T)^{1/2}\; $ for early times. Inflation in the string
theory context is discussed.
