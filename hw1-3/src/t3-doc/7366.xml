<title>
Coset-Space String Compactification Leading To 14 Subcritical Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using sigma-model approach, we study a class of coset spaces with torsion
which compactify the D=26 closed bose-string theory. Requiring also that
massless chiral fermions arise from the geometry/topology of coset space, we
are left with the unique possibility: it implies D=14 subcritical dimensions
and the isometry group G_2 X G_2.
