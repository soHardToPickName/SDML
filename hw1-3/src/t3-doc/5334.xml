New prescription in light-cone gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  New prescription for the singularities of light-cone gauge theories is
suggested. The new prescription provides Green's function which is identical
with and different from that of Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription at $d=4$ and
$d=2$ respectively.
