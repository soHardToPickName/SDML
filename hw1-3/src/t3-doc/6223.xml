PP-wave/Yang-Mills Correspondence: An Explicit Check
</title>

<abstract>
  We present an explicit evidence that shows the correspondence between the
type IIB supergravity in the pp-wave background and its dual supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory at the interaction level. We first construct the cubic term
of the light-cone interaction Hamiltonian for the dilaton-axion sector of the
supergravity. Our result agrees with the corresponding part of the light-cone
string field theory (SFT) and furthermore fixes its previously undetermined
$p^+$-dependent normalization. Adopting thus fixed light-cone SFT, we compute
the matrix elements of light-cone Hamiltonian involving three chiral primary
states and find an agreement with a prediction from the dual Yang-Mills theory.
