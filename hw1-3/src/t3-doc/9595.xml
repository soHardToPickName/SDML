<title>
Classical and Quantum Composite p-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss classical composite p-brane solutions and their quantization using
the conjecture that their fluctuations may be described via degrees of freedom
of Dirichlet strings ended on these p-branes. We work with Dirichlet
(super)strings in framework of string field theory for open (super)strings. To
elaborate in this scheme the eleventh dimension modes we take just a collection
of Dirichlet strings which in their middle points have jumps in eleventh
dimension. This theory can be seen as string field theory in infinite momentum
frame of an eleven dimensional object.
