<title>
Phase transition in one-dimensional lattice gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Considering one-dimensional nonminimally-coupled lattice gauge theories, a
class of nonlocal one-dimensional systems is presented, which exhibits a phase
transition. It is shown that the transition has a latent heat, and, therefore,
is a first order phase transition.
