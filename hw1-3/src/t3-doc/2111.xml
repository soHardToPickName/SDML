A manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group
</title>

<abstract>
  A manifestly gauge invariant exact renormalization group for pure SU(N)
Yang-Mills theory is proposed, allowing gauge invariant calculations, without
any gauge fixing or ghosts. The necessary gauge invariant regularisation which
implements the effective cutoff, is naturally incorporated by embedding the
theory into a spontaneously broken SU(N|N) super-gauge theory. This guarantees
finiteness to all orders in perturbation theory.
