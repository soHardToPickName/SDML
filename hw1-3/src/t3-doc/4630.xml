<title>
Gauge invariant action for superstring in Ramond-Ramond plane-wave
  background
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a gauge invariant action for a superstring in the plane wave
background with Ramond-Ramond (RR) five-form flux. The Wess-Zumino term is
given explicitly in a bilinear form of the left invariant currents by
introducing a fermionic center to define the nondegenerate group metric. The
reparametrization invariance generators, whose combinations are conformal
generators, and fermionic constraints, half of which generate kappa-symmetry,
are obtained. Equations of motion are obtained in conformal invariant and
background covariant manners.
