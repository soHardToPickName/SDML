Non-abelian gauge antisymmetric tensor fields
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the theory of non-abelian gauge antisymmetric tensor fields,
which generalize the standard Yang-MIlls fields and abelian gauge p-forms. The
corresponding gauge group acts on the space of inhomogeneous differential forms
and it is shown to be a supergroup. The wide class of generalized Chern-Simons
actions is constructed.
