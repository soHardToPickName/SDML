Observables of the generalized 2D Yang-Mills theories on arbitrary
  surfaces: a path integral approach
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the path integral method, we calculate the partition function and the
generating functional (of the field strengths) of the generalized 2D Yang-Mills
theories in the Schwinger--Fock gauge. Our calculation is done for arbitrary 2D
orientable, and also nonorientable surfaces.
