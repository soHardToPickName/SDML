<title>
Dimensional regularization of nonlinear sigma models on a finite time
  interval
</title>

<abstract>
  We extend dimensional regularization to the case of compact spaces. Contrary
to previous regularization schemes employed for nonlinear sigma models on a
finite time interval (``quantum mechanical path integrals in curved space'')
dimensional regularization requires only a covariant finite two-loop
counterterm. This counterterm is nonvanishing and given by R/8.
