<title>
A Note on the Relation between Different Forms of Superparticle
  Dynamics'
</title>

<abstract>
  A formulation of $D\is 10$ superparticle dynamics is given that contain
space-time and twistor variables. The set of constraints is entirely first
class, and gauge conditions may be imposed that reduces the system to a
Casalbuoni-Brink-Schwarz superparticle, a spinning particle or a twistor
particle.
