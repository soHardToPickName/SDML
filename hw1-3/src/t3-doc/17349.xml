<title>
On Gauge-Invariant Boundary Conditions for 2d Gravity with Dynamical
  torsion
</title>

<abstract>
  In the example of $R^2+T^2$ gravity on the unit two dimensional disk we
demonstrate that in the presence of an independent spin connection it is
possible to define local gauge invariant boundary conditions even on boundaries
which are not totally geodesic. One-loop partition function and the
corresponding heat kernel are calculated.
