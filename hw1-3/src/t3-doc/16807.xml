Brane Solitons for G_2 Structures in Eleven-Dimensional Supergravity

<abstract>
  We investigate the four-dimensional supergravity theory obtained from the
compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity on a smooth manifold of G_2
holonomy. We give a new derivation for the Kaehler potential associated with
the scalar kinetic term of the N=1 four-dimensional theory. We then examine
some solutions of the four-dimensional theory which arise from wrapped
M-branes.
