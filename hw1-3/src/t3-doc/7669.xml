Gravitating Instantons In 3 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Einstein-Chern-Simons gravity coupled to Yang-Mills-Higgs theory
in three dimensional Euclidean space with cosmological constant. The classical
equations reduce to Bogomol'nyi type first order equations in curved space.
There are BPS type gauge theory instanton (monopole) solutions of finite action
in a gravitational instanton which itself has a finite action. We also discuss
gauge theory instantons in the vacuum (zero action) AdS space. In addition we
point out to some exact solutions which are singular.
