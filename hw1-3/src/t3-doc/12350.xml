<title>
Deformed Heisenberg Algebra with Reflection, Anyons and Supersymmetry of
  Parabosons
</title>

<abstract>
  Deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection appeared in the context of
Wigner's generalized quantization schemes underlying the concept of parafields
and parastatistics of Green, Volkov, Greenberg and Messiah. We review the
application of this algebra for the universal description of ordinary spin-$j$
and anyon fields in 2+1 dimensions, and discuss the intimate relation between
parastatistics and supersymmetry.
