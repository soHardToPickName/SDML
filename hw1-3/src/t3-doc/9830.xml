<title>
Poincare Invariance of a Quantized Duality Symmetric Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The noncovariant duality symmetric action put forward by Schwarz-Sen is
quantized by means of the Dirac bracket quantization procedure. The resulting
quantum theory is shown to be, nevertheless, relativistically invariant.
