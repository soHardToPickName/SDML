<title>
Exact Schwarzschild-Like Solution for Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Drawing on the parallel between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory we
obtain an exact Schwarzschild-like solution for SU(2) gauge fields coupled to a
massless scalar field. Pushing the analogy further we speculate that this
classical solution to the Yang-Mills equations shows confinement in the same
way that particles become confined once they pass the event horizon of the
Schwarzschild solution. Two special cases of the solution are considered.
