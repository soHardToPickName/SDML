<title>
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for singular systems with second order
  Lagrangians
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for first order constrained systems
has been developed. In such formalism the equations of motion are written as
total differential equations in many variables. We generalize the
Hamilton-Jacobi formulation for singular systems with second order Lagrangians
and apply this new formulation to Podolsky electrodynamics, comparing with the
results obtained through Dirac's method.
