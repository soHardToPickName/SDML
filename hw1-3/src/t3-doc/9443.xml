<title>
Triplectic Quantization of W2 gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The role of one loop order corrections in the triplectic quantization is
discussed in the case of W2 theory. This model illustrates the presence of
anomalies and Wess Zumino terms in this quantization scheme where extended BRST
invariance is represented in a completely anticanonical form.
