WZW branes and gerbes
</title>

<abstract>
  We reconsider the role that bundle gerbes play in the formulation of the WZW
model on closed and open surfaces. In particular, we show how an analysis of
bundle gerbes on groups covered by SU(N) permits to determine the spectrum of
symmetric branes in the boundary version of the WZW model with such groups as
the target. We also describe a simple relation between the open string
amplitudes in the WZW models based on simply connected groups and in their
simple-current orbifolds.
