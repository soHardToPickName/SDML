<title>
Differential Geometry on Hopf Algebras and Quantum Groups (Ph.D. Thesis)
</title>

<abstract>
  The differential geometry on a Hopf algebra is constructed, by using the
basic axioms of Hopf algebras and noncommutative differential geometry. The
space of generalized derivations on a Hopf algebra of functions is presented
via the smash product, and used to define and discuss quantum Lie algebras and
their properties. The Cartan calculus of the exterior derivative, Lie
derivative, and inner derivation is found for both the universal and general
differential calculi of an arbitrary Hopf algebra, and, by restricting to the
quasitriangular case and using the numerical R-matrix formalism, the
aforementioned structures for quantum groups are determined.
