Two-Loop Superstrings in Hyperelliptic Language II: the Vanishing of the
  Cosmological Constant and the Non-Renormalization Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  The vanishing of the cosmological constant and the non-renormali-zation
theorem are verified at two loops by explicit computation using the
hyperelliptic language and the newly obtained chiral measure of D'Hoker and
Phong. A set of identities is found which is used in the verification of the
non-renormalization theorem and leads to a great simplification of the
calculation of the four-particle amplitude at two loops.
