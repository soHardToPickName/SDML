<title>
Supergravity solitons and non-perturbative superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  A review is given of the implications of supersymmetric black holes for the
non-perturbative formulation of toroidally compactified superstrings, with
particular emphasis on symmetry enhancement at special vacua and S-duality of
the heterotic string.
