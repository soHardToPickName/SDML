Kink interactions in $SU(N)\times Z_2$
</title>

<abstract>
  There are $N-1$ classes of kink solutions in $SU(N)\times Z_2$. We show how
interactions between various kinks depend on the classes of individual kinks as
well as on their orientations with respect to each other in the internal space.
In particular, we find that the attractive or repulsive nature of the
interaction depends on the trace of the product of charges of the two kinks. We
calculate the interaction potential for all combinations of kinks and antikinks
in $SU(5)\times Z_2$ and study their collisions. The outcome of kink-antikink
collisions, as expected from previous studies, is sensitive to their initial
relative velocity. We find that heavier kinks tend to break up into lighter
ones, while interactions between the lightest kinks and antikinks in this model
can be repulsive as well as attractive.
