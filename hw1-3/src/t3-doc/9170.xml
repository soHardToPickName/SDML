Generalized AdS-CFT Correspondence for Matrix Theory in the Large N
  limit
</title>

<abstract>
  Guided by the generalized conformal symmetry, we investigate the extension of
AdS-CFT correspondence to the matrix model of D-particles in the large N limit.
We perform a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic linearized fluctuations
around a heavy D-particle background in IIA supergravity in 10 dimensions and
find that the spectrum precisely agrees with that of the physical operators of
Matrix theory. The explicit forms of two-point functions give predictions for
the large $N$ behavior of Matrix theory with some special cutoff. We discuss
the possible implications of our results for the large N dynamics of
D-particles and for the Matrix-theory conjecture. We find an anomalous scaling
behavior with respect to the large N limit associated to the infinite momentum
limit in 11 dimensions, suggesting the existence of a screening mechanism for
the transverse extension of the system.
