<title>
Conformal Brane World and Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a recently proposed setup where a codimension one brane is
embedded in the background of a smooth domain wall interpolating between AdS
and Minkowski minima. Since the volume of the transverse dimension is infinite,
bulk supersymmetry is intact even if brane supersymmetry is completely broken.
On the other hand, in this setup unbroken bulk supersymmetry is incompatible
with non-zero brane cosmological constant, so the former appears to protect the
latter. In this paper we point out that, to have a consistent coupling between
matter localized on the brane and bulk gravity, in this setup generically it
appears to be necessary that the brane world-volume theory be conformal. Thus,
unbroken bulk supersymmetry appears to actually protect not only the
cosmological constant but also conformal invariance on the brane.
