General Static Solutions of 2-dimensional
  Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell-Scalar Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  General static solutions of effectively 2-dimensional
Einstein-Dilaton-Maxwell-Scalar theories are obtained. Our model action
includes a class of 2-d dilaton gravity theories coupled with a $U(1)$ gauge
field and a massless scalar field. Therefore it also describes the spherically
symmetric reduction of $d$-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theories. The
properties of the analytic solutions are briefly discussed.
