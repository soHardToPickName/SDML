The Chiral 2-Sphere
</title>

<abstract>
  The two dimensional surface of a sphere can be parametrized by coordinates
representing two charged pions acting as Goldstone bosons of a broken $SU_2$
symmetry. We construct in full concrete detail, and in a general class of
coordinate systems, all the relevant structure forming a framework for this low
energy effective theory.
