<title>
Off-shell amplitudes for nonoriented closed strings
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of the bosonic closed string theory, by using the operatorial
formalism, we give a simple expression of the off-shell amplitude with an
arbitrary number of external massless states inserted on the Klein bottle.
