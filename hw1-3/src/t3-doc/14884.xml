Remarks on Weyl invariant p-branes and Dp-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  A mechanism to find different Weyl invariant p-branes and Dp-branes actions
is explained. Our procedure clarifies the Weyl invariance for such systems.
Besides, by considering gravity-dilaton effective action in higher dimensions
we also derive a Weyl invariant action for p-branes. We argue that this
derivation provides a geometrical scenario for the Weyl invariance of p-branes.
Our considerations can be extended to the case of super-p-branes.
