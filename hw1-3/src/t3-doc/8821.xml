Application of the Faddeev-Jackiw formalism to the gauged WZW model
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-flavor Wess-Zumino model coupled to electromagnetism is treated as a
constraint system using the Faddeev-Jackiw method. Expanding into series of
powers of the pion fields and keeping terms up to second and third order we
obtain Coulomb- gauge Lagrangeans containing non-local terms.
