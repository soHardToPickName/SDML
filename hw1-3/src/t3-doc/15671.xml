<title>
Action with Manifest Duality for Maximally Supersymmetric
  Six-dimensional Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform explicitly the toroidal compactification of eleven dimensional
supergravity to six dimensions and present its action in a manifestly
$SO(5,5)\over SO(5)\times SO(5)$ invariant form using the recently proposed
covariant formulation of theories involving chiral fields.
