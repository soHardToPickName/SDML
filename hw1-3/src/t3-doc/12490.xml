<title>
Coupling Constants and Brane Tensions from Anomaly Cancellation in
  M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The theory of eleven dimensional supergravity on R^10 x S^1/Z_2 with super
Yang-Mills theory on the boundaries is reconsidered. We analyse the general
solution of the modified Bianchi identity for the four-form field strength
using the equations of motion for the three-form and find that the four-form
field strength has a unique value on the boundaries of R^10 x S^1/Z_2.
Considering the local supersymmetry in the "downstairs" approach this leads to
a relation between the eleven dimensional supergravity coupling constants in
the "upstairs" and "downstairs" approaches. Moreover, it is shown using flux
quantization that the brane tensions only have their standard form in the
"downstairs" units. We consider the gauge variation of the classical theory and
find that it cannot be gauge invariant, contrary to a recent claim. Finally we
consider anomaly cancellation in the "downstairs" and "upstairs" approaches and
obtain the values of lambda^6/kappa^4 and the two- and five-brane tensions.
