Classical Solutions in Two-Dimensional String Theory and Gravitational
  Collapse
</title>

<abstract>
  A general solution to the $D=2$ 1-loop beta functions equations including
tachyonic back reaction on the metric is presented. Dynamical black hole
(classical) solutions representing gravitational collapse of tachyons are
constructed. A discussion on the correspondence with the matrix-model approach
is given.
