Schwarzchild Black Holes in Matrix Theory II
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a crude Matrix Theory model for Schwarzchild black holes in
uncompactified dimension greater than $5$. The model accounts for the size,
entropy, and long range state interactions of black holes. The key feature of
the model is a Boltzmann gas of D0 branes, a concept which depends on certain
qualitative features of Matrix Theory which have not previously been utilized
in studies of black holes.
