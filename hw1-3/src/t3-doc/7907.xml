Black Hole Condensation and the Unification of String Vacua
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that black hole condensation can occur at conifold singularities
in the moduli space of type II Calabi--Yau string vacua. The condensate signals
a smooth transition to a new Calabi--Yau space with different Euler
characteristic and Hodge numbers. In this manner string theory unifies the
moduli spaces of many or possibly all Calabi--Yau vacua. Elementary string
states and black holes are smoothly interchanged under the transitions, and
therefore cannot be invariantly distinguished. Furthermore, the transitions
establish the existence of mirror symmetry for many or possibly all Calabi--Yau
manifolds.
