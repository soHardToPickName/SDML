More Dual String Pairs From Orbifolding
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct more dual pairs of type II-heterotic strings in four dimensions
with $N=2,1$ spacetime supersymmetry. On the type II side the construction
utilizes the various possible choices of K3 automorphisms with fixed points
which transform the holomorphic two-form nontrivially, and rotation plus
translation on $T^2$. The Calabi-Yau orbifolds so obtained have non-zero Euler
numbers, so quantum corrections exist on the type IIA strings. The heterotic
string (asymmetric) orbifold duals are found which depend on going to the
enhanced symmetry points. Some aspects of the construction are discussed
including the role of the singularity and the possibility of going beyond the
adiabatic argument. Many of these examples have also orientifold analogs.
