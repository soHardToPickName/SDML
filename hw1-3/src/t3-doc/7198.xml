Liouville Field Theory on Hyperelliptic surface
</title>

<abstract>
  Liouville field theory on hyperelliptic surface is considered. The partition
function of the Liouville field theory on the hyperelliptic surface are
expressed as a correlation function of the Liouville vertex operators on a
sphere and the twist fields.
