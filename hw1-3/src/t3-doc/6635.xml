<title>
Chiral Fermions and AdS/CFT Duality for a Nonabelian Orbifold
</title>

<abstract>
  We present what we believe is the minimal three-family $AdS/CFT$ model
compactified on a nonabelian orbifold $S^{5}/(Q\times Z_{3})$. Nontrivial
irreps of the discrete nonabelian group $Q\times Z_{3}$ are identified with the
$4$ of $SU(4)$ $R$ symmetry to break all supersymmetries, and the scalar
content of the model is sufficient to break the gauge symmetry to the standard
model. According to the conformality hypothesis the progenitor $SU(4)^3 \times
SU(2)^{12}$ theory becomes conformally invariant at an infra-red fixed point of
the renormalization group.
