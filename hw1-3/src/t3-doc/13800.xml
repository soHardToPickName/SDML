Some remarks on tachyon action in 2d string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the effective action of tachyon in the two dimensional string
theory at tree level. We show that already starting from the cubic terms the
action is nonlocal and the usually assumed simplest cubic term does not give
the correct amplitude. Four point 1PI terms are also discussed.
