<abstract>
  We consider the AdS/CFT correspondence in the context of 2d CFT and find that
essentially all ``single particle'' primary fields with higher spin, predicted
from the CFT side are missing from the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the AdS
supergravity. The high mass extension of these missing states gives rise to the
macroscopic entropy of extremal 5d black holes.
