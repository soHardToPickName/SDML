<title>
Effective Energy Approach to Collectively Quantized Systems
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize effective energy variational techniques to study appropriately
quantized solitonic field configurations. Our approach rests on collective
quantization ideas and is specifically designed for the numerical evaluation of
soliton parameters. We employ this method to obtain the one-loop quantum
corrections to the soliton mass and form factor. Special attention is given to
the regularization of the physical observables in the solitonic sector of the
theory. The numerical implementation of the method is demonstrated for a simple
one-dimensional scalar field example.
