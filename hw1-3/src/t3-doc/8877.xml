Multiple Ising Spins Coupled to 2d Quantum Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a model in which p independent Ising spins are coupled to 2d quantum
gravity (in the form of dynamical planar phi-cubed graphs). Consideration is
given to the p tends to infinity limit in which the partition function becomes
dominated by certain graphs; we identify most of these graphs. A truncated
model is solved exactly providing information about the behaviour of the full
model in the limit of small beta. Finally, we derive a bound for the critical
value of the coupling constant, beta_c and examine the magnetization transition
in the limit p tends to zero.
