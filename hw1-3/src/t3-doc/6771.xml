<title>
q-oscillators, (non-)Kaehler manifolds and constrained dynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that q-deformed quantum mechanics (q-deformed Heisenberg algebra)
can be interpreted as quantum mechanics on Kaehler manifolds, or as a quantum
theory with second (or first-) class constraints. (Saclay, T93/027).
