Exact Solution of 1-matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  I review my new method for solving general 1-matrix models by expanding in
$N^{-1}$ without taking a physical continuum limit. Using my method, each
coefficient of the free energy in the genus expansion is exactly computable.
One can include physical information in a function which is uniquely specified
by the action of the model. My method gives completely the same result with the
usual one if the physical fine tuning is done and the leading singular terms
are extracted. I also calculate in the genus three case and confirm the
validity of my method.
