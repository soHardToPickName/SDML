On the connections between Skyrme and Yang Mills theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Skyrme theories on S^3 and S^2, are analyzed using the generalized zero
curvature in any dimensions. In the first case, new symmetries and integrable
sectors, including the B =1 skyrmions, are unraveled. In S^2 the relation to
QCD suggested by Faddeev is discussed
