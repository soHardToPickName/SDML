Explicit connection between conformal field theory and 2+1 Chern-Simons
  theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We give explicit field theoretical representations for the observables of 2+1
dimensional Chern-Simons theory in terms of gauge invariant composites of 2D
WZW fields. To test our identification we compute some basic Wilson loop
correlators reobtaining known results.
