Some remarks on topological 4d-gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the method of S. Wu to study topological 4d-gravity can be
understood within a now standard method designed to produce equivariant
cohomology classes. Next, this general framework is applied to produce some
observables of the topological 4d-gravity.
