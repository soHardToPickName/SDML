New String Theories in Six Dimensions via Branes at Orbifold
  Singularities
</title>

<abstract>
  We present several classes of new 6d string theories which arise via branes
at orbifold singularities. They have compact moduli spaces, associated with
tensor multiplets, given by Weyl alcoves of non-Abelian groups. We discuss
T-duality and Matrix model applications upon compactification.
