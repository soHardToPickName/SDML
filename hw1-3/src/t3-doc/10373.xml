Spontaneous Breakdown of Lorentz Invariance in IIB Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the IIB matrix model, which is conjectured to be a nonperturbative
definition of superstring theory, by introducing an integer deformation
parameter `nu' which couples to the imaginary part of the effective action
induced by fermions. The deformed IIB matrix model continues to be well-defined
for arbitrary `nu', and it preserves gauge invariance, Lorentz invariance, and
the cluster property. We study the model at `nu' = infinity using a
saddle-point analysis, and show that ten-dimensional Lorentz invariance is
spontaneously broken at least down to an eight-dimensional one. We argue that
it is likely that the remaining eight-dimensional Lorentz invariance is further
broken, which can be checked by integrating over the saddle-point
configurations using standard Monte Carlo simulation.
