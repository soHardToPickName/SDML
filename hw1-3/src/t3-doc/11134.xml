Description of moduli space of projective structures via fat graphs
</title>

<abstract>
  We give an elementary explicit construction of cell decomposition of the
moduli space of projective structures on a two dimensional surface analogous to
the decomposition of Penner/Strebel for moduli space of complex structures. The
relations between projective structures and $PGL(2,{\bf C})$ flat connections
are also described. (in the revised version uuencoded pictures are made
printable)
