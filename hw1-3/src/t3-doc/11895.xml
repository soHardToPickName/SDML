<title>
T-duality of axial and vector dyonic integrable models
</title>

<abstract>
  A general construction of affine Non Abelian (NA) - Toda models in terms of
axial and vector gauged two loop WZNW model is discussed. They represent {\it
integrable perturbations} of the conformal $\sigma$-models (with tachyons
included) describing (charged) black hole type string backgrounds. We study the
{\it off-critical} T-duality between certain families of axial and vector type
of integrable models for the case of affine NA- Toda theories with one global
U(1) symmetry. In particular we find the Lie algebraic condition defining a
subclass of {\it T-selfdual} torsionless NA Toda models and their zero
curvature representation.
