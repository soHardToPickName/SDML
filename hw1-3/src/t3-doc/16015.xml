<title>
Entropy of Bosonic Open String and Boundary Conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  The entropy of the states associated to the solutions of the equations of
motion of the bosonic open string with combinations of Neumann and Dirichlet
boundary conditions is given. Also, the entropy of the string in the states $|
A^i > = \alpha^{i}_{-1} |0>$ and $| \phi^a > = \alpha^{a}_{-1} |0>$ that
describe the massless fields on the world-volume of the Dp-brane is computed.
