<title>
Covariant Quantization of D-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We have found that kappa-symmetry allows a covariant quantization provided
the ground state of the theory is strictly massive. For D-p-branes a
Hamiltonian analysis is performed to explain the existence of a manifestly
supersymmetric and Lorentz covariant description of the BPS states of the
theory. The covariant quantization of the D-0-brane is presented as an example.
