Mixed Branes and M(atrix) Theory on Noncommutative Torus
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the noncommutative torus compactification of M(atrix) theory
directly from the string theory by imposing mixed boundary conditions on the
membranes. The relation of various dualities in string theory and M(atrix)
theory compactification on the noncommutative torus are studied.
