Comments on Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The low-energy effective action of supersymmetric D-brane systems consists of
two terms, one of which is of the Born-Infeld type and one of which is of the
Chern-Simons type. I briefly review the status of our understanding of these
terms for both the Abelian and non-Abelian cases.
