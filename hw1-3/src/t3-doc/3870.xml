On group averaging for non-compact groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some aspects of the use of a technique known as group averaging,
which provides a tool for the study of constrained systems. We focus our
attention on the case where the gauge group is non-compact, and a
`renormalized' group averaging method must be introduced. We discuss the
connection between superselection sectors and the rate of divergence of the
group averaging integral.
