The Tachyon Potential in Witten's Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the tachyon potential in the NS sector of Witten's cubic superstring
field theory. In this theory, the pure tachyon contribution to the potential
has no minimum. We find that this remains the case when higher modes up to
level two are included.
