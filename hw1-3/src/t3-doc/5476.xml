<title>
Bosonization of Coordinate Ring of $U_q(SL(N))$. The Cases of $N=2$ and
  $N=3$
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-abelian coordinate ring of $U_q(SL(N))$ (quantum deformation of the
algebra of functions) for $N=2,3$ is represented in terms of conventional
creation and annihilation operators. This allows to construct explicitly
representations of this algebra, which were earlier described in somewhat more
abstract algebraic fashion. Generalizations to $N>3$ and Kac-Moody algebras are
not discussed but look straightforward.
