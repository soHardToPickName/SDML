Quantum Theories on Noncommutative Spaces with Nontrivial Topology:
  Aharonov-Bohm and Casimir Effects
</title>

<abstract>
  After discussing the peculiarities of quantum systems on noncommutative (NC)
spaces with non-trivial topology and the operator representation of the
$\star$-product on them, we consider the Aharonov-Bohm and Casimir effects for
such spaces. For the case of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, we have obtained an
explicit expression for the shift of the phase, which is gauge invariant in the
NC sense. The Casimir energy of a field theory on a NC cylinder is divergent,
while it becomes finite on a torus, when the dimensionless parameter of
noncommutativity is a rational number. The latter corresponds to a well-defined
physical picture. Certain distinctions from other treatments based on a
different way of taking the noncommutativity into account are also discussed.
