<title>
The Mass Spectrum in a Model with Calculable Dynamical Supersymmetry
  Breaking
</title>

<abstract>
  Models with dynamical supersymmetry breaking are interesting because they may
provide a solution to both the gauge hierarchy and the fine-tuning problems.
However, because of strongly interacting dynamics, it is in general impossible
to analyze them quantitatively. One of the few models with calculable dynamical
supersymmetry breaking is a model with SU(5) gauge symmetry and two $10$'s and
two $\bar 5$'s as the matter content. We determine the ground state of this
model, find the vacuum energy, reveal the symmetry breaking pattern and
calculate the mass spectrum. The supertrace mass relation is exploited to
verify the consistency of the calculated mass spectrum, and an accidental
degeneracy is explained.
