<title>
Quantum Gravity with the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  A unified theory of four-dimensional gravity together with the standard model
is presented, with supersymmetry breaking of M-theory at a TeV. Masses of the
the known particles are derived. The cosmological constant is quantum generated
to the observed value. Quantum corrections to the classical compactification
are analyzed, and the scenario is stable.
