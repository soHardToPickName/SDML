Physical States in Two-Dimensional Topological Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Physical states of two-dimensional topological gauge theories are studied
using the BRST formalism in the light-cone gauge. All physical states are
obtained for the abelian theory. There are an infinite number of physical
states with different ghost numbers. Simple examples of physical states in a
non-abelian theory are also given.
