A Comment on Self-Tuning and Vanishing Cosmological Constant in the
  Brane World
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we elaborate on various five dimensional contributions to the
effective 4D cosmological constant in brane systems. In solutions with
vanishing 5D cosmological constant we describe a non-local mechanism of
cancellation of vacuum energy between the brane and the singularities. We
comment on a hidden fine tuning which is implied by this observation.
