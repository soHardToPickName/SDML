<title>
Multicritical Matrix Models and the Chiral Phase Transition
</title>

<abstract>
  Universality of multicritical unitary matrix models is shown and a new
scaling behavior is found in the microscopic region of the spectrum, which may
be relevant for the low energy spectrum of the Dirac operator at the chiral
phase transition.
