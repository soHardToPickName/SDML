Decay widths and scattering processes in massive QED$_2$
</title>

<abstract>
  Using mass perturbation theory, we infer the bound-state spectrum of massive
QED$_2$ and compute some decay widths of unstable bound states. Further, we
discuss scattering processes, where all the resonances and particle production
thresholds are properly taken into account by our methods.
