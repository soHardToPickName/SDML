<title>
High Temperature Partition Function of the Rigid String
</title>

<abstract>
  We find that the high temperature limit of the free energy per unit length
for the rigid string agrees dimensionally with that of the QCD string (unlike
the Nambu-Goto string). The sign, and in fact the phase, do not agree. While
this may be a clue to a string theory of QCD, we note that the problem of the
fourth derivative action makes it impossible for the rigid string to be a
correct description.
