<title>
Largest eigenvalue distribution in the double scaling limit of matrix
  models: A Coulomb fluid approach.
</title>

<abstract>
Using thermodynamic arguments we find that the probability that there are no
eigenvalues in the interval (-s,\infty) in the double scaling limit of
Hermitean matrix models is O(exp(-s^{2m+1})) as s\rightarrow+\infty.Here
m=1,2,3.. determine the m^{th} multi-critical point of the level
density:\sigma(x)\sim b[1-(x/b)^2]^{m-1/2} and b^2\sim N.Furthermore,the size
of the transition zone where the eigenvalue density becomes vanishingly small
at the tail of the spectrum is \sim N^{(m-3/2)/(2m+1)} in agreement with
earlier work based on the string equation.
