Statistical Entropy and AdS/CFT Correspondence in BTZ Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We study AdS/CFT correspondence in the case of AdS3. We obtain the
statistical entropy of the BTZ black hole in terms of the correct central
charge and the conformal dimensions for the states corresponding to the BTZ
black hole. We point out the difference between our method and the old
fashioned approaches based on SL(2,R) Wess-Zumino-Witten model or Liouville
theory.
