On Kinks and Bound States in the Gross-Neveu Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate static space dependent $\sigx=\lag\bar\psi\psi\rag$ saddle
point configurations in the two dimensional Gross-Neveu model in the large N
limit. We solve the saddle point condition for $\sigx$ explicitly by employing
supersymmetric quantum mechanics and using simple properties of the diagonal
resolvent of one dimensional Schr\"odinger operators rather than inverse
scattering techniques. The resulting solutions in the sector of unbroken
supersymmetry are the Callan-Coleman-Gross-Zee kink configurations. We thus
provide a direct and clean construction of these kinks. In the sector of broken
supersymmetry we derive the DHN saddle point configurations. Our method of
finding such non-trivial static configurations may be applied also in other two
dimensional field theories.
