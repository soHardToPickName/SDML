Seven-Loop Critical Exponents from Strong-Coupling phi^4-Theory in Three
  Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  Using strong-coupling quantum field theory we calculate highly accurate
critical exponents nu, eta from new seven-loop expansions in three dimensions.
Our theoretical value for the critical exponent alpha of the specific heat near
the lambda-point of superfluid helium is alpha =-0.01294+-0.00060, in excellent
agreement with the space shuttle experimental value alpha =-0.01285+-0.00038.
