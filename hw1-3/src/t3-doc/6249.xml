On the Anomalous and Global Interactions of Kodaira 7-Planes
</title>

<abstract>
  We review interactions between certain 7-planes which are composed out of
mutually non-local (p,q) 7-branes and which correspond to specific Kodaira
singularities. We discuss in particular how to compute certain moduli-dependent
terms in the effective action. These do not only probe the local Chern-Simons
terms on the world-volumina, but also certain global aspects of plane
interactions that can be attributed to ``torsion'' (or \ZZ_N-valued) D-brane
charges.
