<title>
Heisenberg quantization for the systems of identical particles and the
  Pauli exclusion principle in noncommutative spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Heisenberg quantization for the systems of identical particles
in noncommtative spaces. We get fermions and bosons as a special cases of our
argument, in the same way as commutative case and therefore we conclude that
the Pauli exclusion principle is also valid in noncommutative spaces.
