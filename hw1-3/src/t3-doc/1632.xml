On Orientifolds, Discrete Torsion, Branes and M Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find some lifts to M theory of orientifold and orbifold planes including
the O1, O3 and O5 planes of Type IIB and their transformations under SL(2,Z).
The possible discrete torsion variants (or K theory classes) are explored, and
are interpreted as arising from brane intersections with planes. We find new
variants of the O0 and of an orbifold line (OF1) and determine their tensions
in some cases. A systematic review of orientifolds, M orientifolds, and known M
lifts, with some new clarifications is included together with a discussion of
the role of T duality.
