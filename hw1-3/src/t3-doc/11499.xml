<title>
Spectral invariants for the Dirac equation on the d-Ball with various
  boundary conditions
</title>

<abstract>
  The mode properties for spectral and mixed boundary conditions for massless
spin-half fields are derived for the $d$--ball. The corresponding functional
determinants and heat-kernel coefficients are presented, the latter as
polynomials in $d$.
