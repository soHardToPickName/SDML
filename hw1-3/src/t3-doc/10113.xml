<title>
Noncommutative Field Theory and Lorentz Violation
</title>

<abstract>
  The role of Lorentz symmetry in noncommutative field theory is considered.
Any realistic noncommutative theory is found to be physically equivalent to a
subset of a general Lorentz-violating standard-model extension involving
ordinary fields. Some theoretical consequences are discussed. Existing
experiments bound the scale of the noncommutativity parameter to (10 TeV)^{-2}.
