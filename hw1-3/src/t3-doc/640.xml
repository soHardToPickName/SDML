Cauchy Horizons, Thermodynamics and Closed Time-like Curves in Planar
  Supersymmetric Space-times
</title>

<abstract>
  We study geodesically complete, singularity free space-times induced by
supersymmetric planar domain walls interpolating between Minkowski and anti-de
Sitter ($AdS_4$) vacua. A geodesically complete space-time without closed
time-like curves includes an infinite number of semi-infinite Minkowski
space-times, separated from each other by a region of $AdS_4$ space-time. These
space-times are closely related to the extreme Reissner Nordstr\" om (RN) black
hole, exhibiting Cauchy horizons with zero Hawking temperature, but in contrast
to the RN black hole there is no entropy. Another geodesically complete
extension with closed time-like curves involves space-times connecting a finite
number of semi-infinite Minkowski space-times.
