Coupling of Tachyons and Discrete States in $c = 1$ 2-D Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  All the three point couplings involving tachyons and/or discrete states are
obtained in $c=1$ two-dimensional (2-D) quantum gravity by means of the
operator product expansion (OPE). Cocycle factors are found to be necessary in
order to maintain the analytic structure of the OPE, and are constructed
explicitly both for discrete states and for tachyons. The effective action
involving tachyons and discrete states is worked out to summarize all of these
three point couplings.
