Notes on Giant Gravitons on PP-waves
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the giant gravitons in the maximally supersymmetric IIB
pp-wave from several viewpoints: (i) the dynamics of D3-branes, (ii) the
world-sheet description and (iii) the correlation functions in the dual N=4
Yang-Mills theory. In particular, we derive the BPS equation of a D3-brane with
magnetic flux, which is equivalent to multiple D-strings, and discuss the
behavior of solutions in the presence of RR-flux. We find solutions which
represent the excitations of the giant gravitons in that system.
