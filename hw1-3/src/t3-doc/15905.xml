Local Fields on the Brane Induced by Nonlocal Fields in the Bulk
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate quantum field theory in a bulk space with boundary, which
represents a 3-brane. Both flat and anti-de Sitter backgrounds are considered.
The basic idea is to keep local commutativity only on the brane, giving up this
requirement in the bulk. We explore the consequences of this proposal,
constructing a large family of nonlocal bulk fields, whose brane relatives are
local. We estimate the ultraviolet behavior of these local brane fields,
characterizing a subfamily which generates renormalizable theories on the
brane. The issue of brane conformal invariance and the relation between bulk
and brane conserved currents are also examined in this framework.
