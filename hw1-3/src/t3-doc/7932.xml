Fermion mixing in quasi-free states
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum field theoretic treatments of fermion oscillations are typically
restricted to calculations in Fock space. In this letter we extend the
oscillation formulae to include more general quasi-free states, and also
consider the case when the mixing is not unitary.
