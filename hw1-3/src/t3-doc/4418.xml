The Langevin equation on a cell complex
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider a cell-complex in an arbitrary Hausdorff space as a dynamical
object that can be coupled to a field defined on the complex. The Langevin
equation is then derived for this field. In other words, a noise-field is
created resulting from the field/geometry interactions.
