Renormalization Group Flows from D=3, N=2 Matter Coupled Gauged
  Supergravities
</title>

<abstract>
  We study holographic RG flows of N=2 matter couple AdS_3 supergravities which
admit both compact and non-compact sigma manifolds. For the compact case the
supersymmetric domain wall solution interpolates between a conformal IR region
and flat spacetime and this corresponds to a deformation of the CFT by an
irrelevant operator. When it is non-compact, the solution can be interpreted as
a flow between an UV fixed point and a non-conformal(singular) IR region. This
is an exact example of a deformation flow when the singularity is physical. We
also find a non-supersymmetric deformation flow when the scalar potential has a
second AdS vacua. The ratio of the central charges is rational for certain
values of the size of the sigma model. Next, we analyze the spectrum of a
massless scalar on our background by transforming the problem into Schroedinger
form. The spectrum is continuous for the compact model, yet it can be both
continuous (with or without mass gap) and discrete otherwise. Finally, 2-point
functions are computed for two examples whose quantum mechanical potentials are
of Calogero type.
