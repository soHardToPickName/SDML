A Self-Consistent Formulation of Quantum Field Theory on $S_{4}$
</title>

<abstract>
  Recent developments in quantum gravity suggest that wormholes may influence
the observed values of the constants of nature. The Euclidean formulation of
quantum gravity predicts that wormholes induce a probability distribution in
the space of possible fundamental constants. This distribution may computed by
evaluating the functional integral about the stationary points of the action.
In particular, the effective action on a large spherical space may lead to the
vanishing of the cosmological constant and possibly determine the values of
other constants of nature. The ability to perform calculations involving
interacting quantum fields, particularly non-Abelian models, on a four-sphere
is vital if one is to investigate this possibility. In this paper we present a
self-consistent formulation of field theory on a four-sphere using the angular
momentum space representation of $SO(5)$. We give a review of field theory on a
sphere and then show how a matrix element prescription in angular momentum
space overcomes previous limitations in calculational techniques.
  The standard one-loop graphs of QED are given as examples.
