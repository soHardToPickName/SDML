Axial current in QED and semi-naive dimensional renormalization
</title>

<abstract>
  We renormalize at two loops the axial current and $F \tilde{F}$ in massless
QED, using the recently proposed semi-naive dimensional renormalization scheme.
We show that the results are in agreement with those in the
Breitenlohner-Maison-'t Hooft-Veltman scheme, previously obtained indirectly by
making a three-loop computation.
