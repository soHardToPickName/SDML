Quantum corrections for D=4 black holes and D=5 strings
</title>

<abstract>
  In recent times quantum corrections for N=2 black holes in 4 dimensions have
been addressed in the framework of double extreme black hole solutions, which
are characterised by constant scalar fields. In this paper we generalize these
solutions to non-constant scalar fields. This enables us to discuss quantum
corrections for massless black holes and for configurations that are
classically singular. We also discuss the relation to the 5-dimensional
magnetic string solution.
