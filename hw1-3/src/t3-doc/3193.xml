Topological Field Theories and the Period Integrals
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss topological Landau-Ginzburg theories coupled to the 2-dimensional
topological gravity. We point out that the basic recursion relations for
correlation functions of the 2-dimesional gravity have exactly the same form as
the Gauss-Manin differential equations for the period integrals of
superpotentials. Thus the one-point functions on the sphere of the
Landau-Ginzburg theories are given exactly by the period integrals. We discuss
various examples, A-D-E minimal models and the $c=3$ topological theories.
