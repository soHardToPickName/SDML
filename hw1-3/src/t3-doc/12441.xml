<title>
Only hybrid anyons can exist in broken symmetry phase of nonrelativistic
  $U(1)^{2}$ Chern-Simons theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present two examples of parity-invariant $[U(1)]^{2}$ Chern-Simons-Higgs
models with spontaneously broken symmetry. The models possess topological
vortex excitations. It is argued that the smallest possible flux quanta are
composites of one quantum of each type $(1,1)$. These hybrid anyons will
dominate the statistical properties near the ground state. We analyse their
statistical interactions and find out that unlike in the case of Jackiw-Pi
solitons there is short range magnetic interaction which can lead to formation
of bound states of hybrid anyons. In addition to mutual interactions they
possess internal structure which can lead upon quantisation to discrete
spectrum of energy levels.
