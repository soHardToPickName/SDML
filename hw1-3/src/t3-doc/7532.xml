<title>
Gaussian approximation of the (2+1) dimensional Thirring model in the
  functional Schr\"{o}dinger picture
</title>

<abstract>
  The (2+1)-dimensional Thirring model is studied by using the Gaussian
approximation method in the functional Schr\"odinger picture. Although the
dynamical symmetry breaking does not occur in the large N limit, it does occur
in the Gaussian approximation which includes the higher order contributions in
1/N.
