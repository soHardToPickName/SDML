<title>
A New Type of Superstring in four dimension
</title>

<abstract>
  A bosonic string in twenty six dimensions is effectively reduced to four
dimensions by eleven Majorana fermions which are vectors in the bosonic
represetation SO(d-1,1). By dividing the fermions in two groups, actions can be
written down which are world sheet supersymmetric, 2-d local and local 4-d
supersymmetric. The novel string is anomally free, free of ghosts and the
partition function is modular invariant.
