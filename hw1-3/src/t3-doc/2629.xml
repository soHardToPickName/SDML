<title>
Non-renormalizability of \theta-expanded noncommutative QED
</title>

<abstract>
  Computing all divergent one-loop Green's functions of \theta-expanded
noncommutative quantum electrodynamics up to first order in \theta, we show
that this model is not renormalizable. The reason is a divergence in the
electron four-point function which cannot be removed by field redefinitions.
Ignoring this problem, we find however clear hints for new symmetries in
massless \theta-expanded noncommutative QED: Four additional divergences which
would be compatible with gauge and Lorentz symmetries and which are not
reachable by field redefinitions are absent.
