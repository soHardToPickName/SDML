Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics: Free Case
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a review work on Supersymmetric Classical Mechanics in the context
of a Lagrangian formalism, with $N=1-$supersymmetry. We show that the N=1
supersymmetry does not allow the introduction of a potential energy term
depending on a single commuting supercoordinate, $\phi (t;\Theta)$.
