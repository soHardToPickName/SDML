Cubic Interactions of Bosonic Higher Spin Gauge Fields in $AdS_5$
</title>

<abstract>
  The dynamics of totally symmetric free massless higher spin fields in $AdS_d$
is reformulated in terms of the compensator formalism for AdS gravity. The
$AdS_5$ higher spin algebra is identified with the star product algebra with
the $su(2,2)$ vector (i.e., $o(4,2)$ spinor) generating elements. Cubic
interactions of the totally symmetric bosonic higher spin gauge fields in
$AdS_5$, including the interaction with gravity, are formulated at the action
level.
