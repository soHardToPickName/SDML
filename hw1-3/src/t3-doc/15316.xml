<title>
Semiclassical Analysis of Quasi-Exact Solvability
</title>

<abstract>
  Higher-order WKB methods are used to investigate the border between the
solvable and insolvable portions of the spectrum of quasi-exactly solvable
quantum-mechanical potentials. The analysis reveals scaling and factorization
properties that are central to quasi-exact solvability. These two properties
define a new class of semiclassically quasi-exactly solvable potentials.
