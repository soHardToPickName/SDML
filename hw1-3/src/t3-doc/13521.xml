Precise determination of critical exponents and equation of state by
  field theory methods
</title>

<abstract>
  Renormalization group, and in particular its Quantum Field Theory
implementation has provided us with essential tools for the description of the
phase transitions and critical phenomena beyond mean field theory. We therefore
review the methods, based on renormalized phi^4_3 quantum field theory and
renormalization group, which have led to a precise determination of critical
exponents of the N-vector model (R. Guida and J. Zinn-Justin, J. Phys. A31
(1998) 8103. cond-mat/9803240). and of the equation of state of the 3D Ising
model (R. Guida and J. Zinn-Justin, Nucl. Phys. B489 [FS] (1997) 626,
hep-th/9610223.). These results are among the most precise available probing
field theory in a non-perturbative regime.
