<title>
Faddeev-Jackiw formalism for a topological-like oscillator in planar
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of a harmonic oscillator coupling to an electromagnetic potential
plus a topological-like (Chern-Simons) massive term, in two-dimensional space,
is studied in the light of the symplectic formalism proposed by Faddeev and
Jackiw for constrained systems.
