A New Derivation of the Picard-Fuchs Equations for Effective $N = 2$
  Super Yang-Mills Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A new method to obtain the Picard-Fuchs equations of effective $N = 2$
supersymmetric gauge theories in 4 dimensions is developed. It includes both
pure super Yang-Mills and supersymmetric gauge theories with massless matter
hypermultiplets. It applies to all classical gauge groups, and directly
produces a decoupled set of second-order, partial differential equations
satisfied by the period integrals of the Seiberg-Witten differential along the
1-cycles of the algebraic curves describing the vacuum structure of the
corresponding $N = 2$ theory.
