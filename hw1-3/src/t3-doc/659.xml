Singularity Free (Homogeneous Isotropic) Universe in Graviton-Dilaton
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a class of graviton-dilaton models in which a homogeneous
isotropic universe, such as our observed one, evolves with no singularity at
any time. Such models may stand on their own as interesting models for
singularity free cosmology, and may be studied further accordingly. They may
also arise from string theory. We discuss critically a few such possibilities.
