Towards Matrix Models in IIB Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  I review the properties of a matrix action of relevance for IIB superstrings.
This model generalizes the action proposed by Ishibashi, Kawai, Kitazawa, and
Tsuchiya by introducing an auxillary field Y, which is the matrix version of
the auxillary field g in the Schild action.
