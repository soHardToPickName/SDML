<title>
Infinite Conformal Algebras in Supersymmetric Theories on Four Manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a supersymmetric theory twisted on a K\"ahler four manifold
$M=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2 ,$ where $\Sigma_{1,2}$ are 2D Riemann surfaces. We
demonstrate that it possesses a "left-moving" conformal stress tensor on
$\Sigma_1$ ($\Sigma_2$) in a BRST cohomology, which generates the Virasoro
algebra with the conventional commutation relations. The central charge of the
Virasoro algebra has a purely geometric origin and is proportional to the Euler
characteristic $\c$ of the $\Sigma_2$ ($\Sigma_1$) surface. It is shown that
this construction can be extended to include a realization of a Kac-Moody
algebra in BRST cohomology with a level proportional to the Euler
characteristic $\c .$ This structure is shown to be invariant under
renormalization group. A representation of the algebra $W_{1+\infty}$ in terms
of a free chiral supermultiplet is also given. We discuss the role of
instantons and a possible relation between the dynamics of 4D Yang-Mills
theories and those of 2D sigma models.
