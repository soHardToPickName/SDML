<title>
Asymptotic Level State Density for Parabosonic Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  Making use of some results concerning the theory of partitions, relevant in
number theory, the complete asymptotic behavior, for large $n$, of the level
density of states for a parabosonic string is derived. It is also pointed out
the similarity between parabosonic strings and membranes.
