Logarithmic Unification From Symmetries Enhanced in the Sub-Millimeter
  Infrared
</title>

<abstract>
  In theories with TeV string scale and sub-millimeter extra dimensions the
attractive picture of logarithmic gauge coupling unification at $10^{16}$ GeV
is seemingly destroyed. In this paper we argue to the contrary that logarithmic
unification {\it can} occur in such theories. The rationale for unification is
no longer that a gauge symmetry is restored at short distances, but rather that
a geometric symmetry is restored at large distances in the bulk away from our
3-brane. The apparent `running' of the gauge couplings to energies far above
the string scale actually arises from the logarithmic variation of classical
fields in (sets of) two large transverse dimensions. We present a number of N=2
and N=1 supersymmetric D-brane constructions illustrating this picture for
unification.
