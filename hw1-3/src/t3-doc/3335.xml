<title>
Fractal distribution function and fractal-deformed Heisenberg algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the concept of fractons, i.e. particles or quasiparticles which
obey specific fractal distribution function and for each universal class h of
particles we obtain a fractal-deformed Heisenberg algebra. This one takes into
account the braid group structure of these objects which live in
two-dimensional multiply connected space.
