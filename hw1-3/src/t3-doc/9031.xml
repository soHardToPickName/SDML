<title>
Finite VEVs from a Large Distance Vacuum Wave Functional
</title>

<abstract>
  We show how to compute vacuum expectation values from derivative expansions
of the vacuum wave functional. Such expansions appear to be valid only for
slowly varying fields, but by exploiting analyticity in a complex scale
parameter we can reconstruct the contribution from rapidly varying fields.
