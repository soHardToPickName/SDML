<title>
Duality and cosmological compactification of superstrings with unbroken
  supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmological compactification of D=10, N=1 supergravity-super-Yang-Mills
theory obtained from superstring theory is studied. The constraint of unbroken
N=1 supersymmetry is imposed. A duality transformation is performed on the
resulting consistency conditions. The original equations as well as the
transformed equations are solved numerically to obtain new configurations with
a nontrivial scale factor and a dynamical dilaton. It is shown that various
classes of solutions are possible, which include cosmological solutions with no
initial singularity.
