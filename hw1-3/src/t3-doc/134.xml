<title>
Does gravitational wave propagate in the five dimensional space-time
  with Kaluza-Klein monopole?
</title>

<abstract>
   The behavior of small perturbations around the Kaluza-Klein monopole in the
five dimensional space-time is investigated. The fact that the odd parity
gravitational wave does not propagate in the five dimensional space-time with
Kaluza-Klein monopole is found provided that the gravitational wave is constant
in the fifth direction.
