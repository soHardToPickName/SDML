Time-ordered Perturbation Theory on Noncommutative Spacetime II:
  Unitarity
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the unitarity issue in the recently proposed time-ordered
perturbation theory on noncommutative (NC) spacetime. We show that unitarity is
preserved as long as the interaction Lagrangian is explicitly Hermitian. We
explain why it makes sense to distinguish the Hermiticity of the Lagrangian
from that of the action in perturbative NC field theory and how this
requirement fits in the framework.
