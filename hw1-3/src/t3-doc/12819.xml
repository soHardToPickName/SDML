Quaternions and Special Relativity
</title>

<abstract>
  We reformulate Special Relativity by a quaternionic algebra on reals. Using
{\em real linear quaternions}, we show that previous difficulties, concerning
the appropriate transformations on the $3+1$ space-time, may be overcome. This
implies that a complexified quaternionic version of Special Relativity is a
choice and not a necessity.
