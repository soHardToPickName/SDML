<title>
Pair Production and Vacuum Polarization of Arbitrary Spin Particles with
  EDM and AMM
</title>

<abstract>
  The exact solutions of the wave equation for arbitrary spin particles with
electric dipole and magnetic moments in the constant and uniform
electromagnetic field were found. The differential probability of pair
production of particles by an external electromagnetic field has been
calculated on the basis of the exact solutions. We have also estimated the
imaginary part of the constant and uniform electromagnetic field. The nonlinear
corrections to the Maxwell Lagrangian have been calculated taking into account
the vacuum polarization of arbitrary spin particles. The role of electric
dipole and magnetic moments of arbitrary spin particles in instability of the
vacuum is discussed.
