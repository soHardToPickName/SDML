A Note on the D-2-Brane of the Massive Type IIA Theory and Gauged Sigma
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Gauging the M-2-brane effective action with respect to an Abelian isometry in
such a way that the invariance under gauge transformations of the 3-form
potential is maintained (slightly modified) we obtain a fully covariant action
with 11-dimensional target space that gives the massive D-2-brane effective
action upon dimensional reduction in the direction of the gauged isometry.
