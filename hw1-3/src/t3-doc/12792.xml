Orbits of a String around a Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical orbits of a test string in the transverse space of a singular
heterotic fivebrane source are classified. The orbits are found to be either
circular or open, but not conic because the inverse square law is not satisfied
at long range. This result differs from predictions of General Relativity. The
conserved total angular momentum contains an intrinsic component from the
fivebrane source, analogous to the electron-monopole case.
