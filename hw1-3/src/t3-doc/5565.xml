<title>
(J,0)+(0,j) Representation Space: Dirac-Like Construct
</title>

<abstract>
  This is first of the two invited lectures presented (by D. V. Ahluwalia) at
the ``XVII International School of Theoretical Physics: Standard Model and
Beyond' 93.'' The text is essentially based on a recent publication by the
present authors [Phys. Lett. B 316 (1993) 102]. Here we show that the
Dirac-like construct in the $(j,0)\oplus(0,j)$ representation space supports a
Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner-type quantum field theory.
