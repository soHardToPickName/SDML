Gauge Dependence in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the AdS space formulation of the classical dynamics deriving from
the Stueckelberg Lagrangian. The on-shell action is shown to be free of
infrared singularities as the vector boson mass tends to zero. In this limit
the model becomes Maxwell theory formulated in an arbitrary covariant gauge.
Then we use the AdS/CFT correspondence to compute the two-point correlation
functions on the boundary. It is shown that the gauge dependence concentrates
on the contact terms.
