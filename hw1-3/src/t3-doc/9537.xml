Gauge Symmetry in Background Charge Conformal Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a mechanism to construct four-dimensional charged massless Ramond
states using the discrete states of a fivebrane Liouville internal conformal
field theory. This conformal field theory has background charge, and admits an
inner product which allows positive norm states. A connection among
supergravity soliton solutions, Liouville conformal field theory, non-critical
string theory and their gauge symmetry properties is given. A generalized
construction of the SU(2) super Kac-Moody algebra mixing with the N=1 super
Virasoro algebra is analyzed. How these Ramond states evade the DKV no-go
theorem is explained.
