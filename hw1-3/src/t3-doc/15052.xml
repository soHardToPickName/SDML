Why Aren't Black Holes Infinitely Produced?
</title>

<abstract>
  Unitarity and locality imply a remnant solution to the information problem,
and also imply that Reissner-Nordstrom black holes have infinite numbers of
internal states. Pair production of such black holes is reexamined including
the contribution of these states. It is argued that the rate is proportional to
the thermodynamic quantity Tr e^{-beta H}, where the trace is over the internal
states of a black hole; this is in agreement with estimates from an effective
field theory for black holes. This quantity, and the rate, is apparently
infinite due to the infinite number of states. One obvious out is if the number
of internal states of a black hole is finite.
