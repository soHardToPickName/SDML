<title>
The Yangian symmetry of the Hubbard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We discovered new hidden symmetry of the one-dimensional Hubbard model. We
showthat the one-dimensional Hubbard model on the infinite chain has the
infinite-dimensional algebra of symmetries. This algebra is a direct sum of two
$ sl(2) $-Yangians. This $ Y(sl(2)) \oplus Y(sl(2)) $ symmetry is an extension
of the well-known $ sl(2) \oplus sl(2) $ . The deformation parameters of the
Yangians are equal up to the signs to the coupling constant of the Hubbard
model hamiltonian.
