<title>
On the quantum BRST structure of classical mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST-antiBRST invariant path integral formulation of classical mechanics
of Gozzi et al is generalized to pseudomechanics. It is shown that projections
to physical propagators may be obtained by BRST-antiBRST invariant boundary
conditions. The formulation is also viewed from recent group theoretical
results within BRST-antiBRST invariant theories. A natural bracket expressed in
terms of BRST and antiBRST charges in the extended formulation is shown to be
equal to the Poisson bracket. Several remarks on the operator formulation are
made.
