N = 1 Field Theory Duality from M-theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate Seiberg's N=1 field theory duality for four-dimensional
supersymmetric QCD with the M-theory 5-brane. We find that the M-theory
configuration for the magnetic dual theory arises via a smooth deformation of
the M-theory configuration for the electric theory. The creation of Dirichlet
4-branes as Neveu-Schwarz 5-branes are passed through each other in Type IIA
string theory is given a nice derivation from M-theory.
