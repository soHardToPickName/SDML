On Einstein-Hilbert type action of superon-graviton model(SGM)
</title>

<abstract>
  The fundamental action of superon-graviton model(SGM) of Einstein-Hilbert
type for space-time and matter is written down explicitly in terms of the
fields of the graviton and superons by using the affine connection formalism
and the spin connection formalism. Some characteristic structures including
some hidden symmetries of the gravitational coupling of superons are manifested
(in two dimensional space-time) with some details of the calculations. SGM
cosmology is discussed briefly.
