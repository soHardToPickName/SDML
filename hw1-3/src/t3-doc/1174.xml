On the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutative gauge theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the properties of the energy-momentum tensor in non-commutative
gauge theories by coupling them to a weak external gravitational field. In
particular, we show that the stress tensor of such a theory coincides exactly
with that derived from a theory where a Seiberg-Witten map has been implemented
(namely, the procedure is commutative). Various other interesting features are
also discussed.
