Anti-de Sitter branes with Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond-Ramond backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We review some facts about AdS2xS2 branes in AdS3xS3 with a Neveu-Schwarz
background, and consider the case of Ramond-Ramond backgrounds. We compute the
spectrum of quadratic fluctuations in the low-energy approximation and discuss
the open-string geometry.
