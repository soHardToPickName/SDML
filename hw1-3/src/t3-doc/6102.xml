<title>
Orientifolds of Non-Supersymmetric Asymmetric Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider certain four dimensional supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric
asymmetric orbifolds with vanishing cosmological constant up to two loops and
gauge the world sheet parity transformation. This leads to new string vacua, in
which Dp and D(p-4) branes or Dp and anti-D(p-4) are identified. Moreover, it
is shown that different degrees of supersymmetry can be realized in the bulk
and on the brane. We show that for non-supersymmetric models the cosmological
constant still vanishes at one loop order.
