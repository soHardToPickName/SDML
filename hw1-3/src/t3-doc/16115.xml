<title>
Seiberg-Witten curves for elliptic models
</title>

<abstract>
  Four-dimensional N=2 gauge theories may be obtained from configurations of
D-branes in type IIA string theory. Unitary gauge theories with two-index
representations, and orthogonal and symplectic gauge theories, are constructed
from configurations containing orientifold planes. Models with two orientifold
planes imply a compact dimension, and correspond to elliptic models. Lifting
these configurations to M-theory allows one to derive the Seiberg-Witten curves
for these gauge theories. We describe how the Seiberg-Witten curves,
necessarily of infinite order, are obtained for these elliptic models. These
curves are used to calculate the instanton expansion of the prepotential; we
explicitly find the one-instanton prepotential for all the elliptic models
considered.
