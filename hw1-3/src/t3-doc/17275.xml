Black Hole Spectrum, Horison Quantization and All That
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the possibility that quantum black holes have discrete mass
spectrum. Different arguments leading to this conclusion are considered,
particularly the decoupling between left and right sectors in string theory -
the so-called heterotic principle. The case of a $2+1$ dimensional black holes
is considered as an argument in favour of this argument. The possible
connection between membrane model of the black hole horizon and topological
membrane is briefly discussed.
