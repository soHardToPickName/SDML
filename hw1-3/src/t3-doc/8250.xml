<title>
Gauge-invariant gravitational perturbations of maximally symmetric
  spacetimes
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational perturbations of anti-deSitter spacetime play important roles
in AdS/CFT correspondence and the brane world scenario. In this paper, we
develop a gauge-invariant formalism of gravitational perturbations of maximally
symmetric spacetimes including anti-deSitter spacetime. Existence of
scalar-type master variables is shown and the corresponding master equations
are derived.
