Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics from Light Cone Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems that arise from
discrete light cone quantization of theories with minimal supersymmetry in
various dimensions. These systems, which have previously arisen in the study of
black hole moduli spaces, are distinguished by having fewer fermionic fields
than the familiar K\"ahler and hyper-K\"ahler models.
