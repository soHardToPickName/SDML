Unified Einstein-Virasoro Master Equation in the General Non-Linear
  Sigma Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The Virasoro master equation (VME) describes the general affine-Virasoro
construction $T=L^{ab}J_aJ_b+iD^a \dif J_a$ in the operator algebra of the WZW
model, where $L^{ab}$ is the inverse inertia tensor and $D^a $ is the
improvement vector. In this paper, we generalize this construction to find the
general (one-loop) Virasoro construction in the operator algebra of the general
non-linear sigma model. The result is a unified Einstein-Virasoro master
equation which couples the spacetime spin-two field $L^{ab}$ to the background
fields of the sigma model. For a particular solution $L_G^{ab}$, the unified
system reduces to the canonical stress tensors and conventional Einstein
equations of the sigma model, and the system reduces to the general
affine-Virasoro construction and the VME when the sigma model is taken to be
the WZW action. More generally, the unified system describes a space of
conformal field theories which is presumably much larger than the sum of the
general affine-Virasoro construction and the sigma model with its canonical
stress tensors. We also discuss a number of algebraic and geometrical
properties of the system, including its relation to an unsolved problem in the
theory of $G$-structures on manifolds with torsion.
