Supersymmetric Fivebrane Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the conditions for the fivebrane worldvolume theory in D=11 to admit
supersymmetric solitons with non-vanishing self-dual three-form. We construct
some new soliton solutions consisting of ``superpositions'' of calibrated
surfaces, self-dual strings and instantons.
