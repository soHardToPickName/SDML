<title>
Modulo 2 periodicity of complex Clifford algebras and electromagnetic
  field
</title>

<abstract>
  Electromagnetic field is considered in the framework of Clifford algebra
$\C_2$ over a field of complex numbers. It is shown here that a modulo 2
periodicity of complex Clifford algebras may be connected with electromagnetic
field.
