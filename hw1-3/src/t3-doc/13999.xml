<title>
Transonic Elastic Model for Wiggly Goto-Nambu String
</title>

<abstract>
  The hitherto controversial proposition that a ``wiggly" Goto-Nambu cosmic
string can be effectively represented by an elastic string model of exactly
transonic type (with energy density $U$ inversely proportional to its tension
$T$) is shown to have a firm mathematical basis.
