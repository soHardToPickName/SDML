<title>
Differential Algebras in Non-Commutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the differential algebras used in Connes' approach to Yang-Mills
theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These differential algebras
generated by algebras of the form functions $\otimes$ matrix are shown to be
skew tensorproducts of differential forms with a specific matrix algebra. For
that we derive a general formula for differential algebras based on tensor
products of algebras. The result is used to characterize differential algebras
which appear in models with one symmetry breaking scale.
