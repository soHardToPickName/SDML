<title>
Cones, Tri-Sasakian Structures and Superconformal Invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we show that rigid N=2 superconformal hypermultiplets must have
target manifolds which are cones over tri-Sasakian metrics. We comment on the
relation of this work to cone-branes and the AdS/CFT correspondence.
