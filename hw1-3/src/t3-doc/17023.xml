Matrix Theory from Schild Action
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the Schild action for membrane, we present an alternative
formulation of Matrix Theory. First of all, we construct the Schild action for
general bosonic p-brane which is classically equivalent to the Nambu-Goto
action for p-brane. Next, based on the constraint obtained from the variational
equation for the auxiliary field in the case of $p = 2$ (membrane), we
construct a new matrix model which is closely related to the matrix model of
M-theory as developed by Banks, Fischler, Shenker and Susskind (BFSS). Our
present formulation is a natural extension of the construction of type IIB
matrix model by Yoneya to the case of M-theory.
