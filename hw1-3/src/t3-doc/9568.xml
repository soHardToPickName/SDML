<title>
Euclidean D-branes and higher-dimensional gauge theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider euclidean D-branes wrapping around manifolds of exceptional
holonomy in dimensions seven and eight. The resulting theory on the
D-brane---that is, the dimensional reduction of 10-dimensional supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory---is a cohomological field theory which describes the
topology of the moduli space of instantons. The 7-dimensional theory is an N_T
= 2 (or balanced) cohomological theory given by an action potential of
Chern-Simons type. As a by-product of this method, we construct a related
cohomological field theory which describes the monopole moduli space on a
7-manifold of G_2 holonomy.
