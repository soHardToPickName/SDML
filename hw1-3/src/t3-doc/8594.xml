<title>
The solution to Wheeler-DeWitt is eight
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe a new geometrical solution to the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in two
dimensional quantum gravity. The solution is the amplitude of a surface whose
boundary consists of two tangent loops. We further discuss a new method for
estimating singular geometries amplitudes, which uses explicit recursive
counting of discrete surfaces.
