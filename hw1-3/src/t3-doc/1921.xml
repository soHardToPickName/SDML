<title>
Effective Lagrangians for (0+1) and (1+1) dimensionally reduced versions
  of D=4 N=2 SYM theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider dimensionally reduced versions of N=2 four- dimensional
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and determine the one-loop effective
Lagrangians associated with the motion over the corresponding moduli spaces. In
the (0+1) case, the effective Lagrangian describes an N=4 supersymmetric
quantum mechanics of the Diaconescu--Entin type. In (1+1) dimensions, the
effective Lagrangian represents a twisted N=4 supesymmetric sigma model due to
Gates, Hull, and Rocek. We discuss the genetic relationship between these two
models and present the explicit results for all gauge groups.
