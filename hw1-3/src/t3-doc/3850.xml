WDVV Equations and Seiberg-Witten theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a review of the results on the associativity algebras and WDVV
equations associated with the Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 SUSY gauge
theories. It is mostly based on the integrable treatment of these solutions. We
consider various examples of the Seiberg-Witten solutions and corresponding
integrable systems and discuss when the WDVV equations hold. We also discuss a
covariance of the general WDVV equations.
