<title>
Absence of Zero Energy States in Reduced SU(N) 3d Supersymmetric Yang
  Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  For the SU(N) invariant supersymmetric matrix model related to membranes in 4
space-time dimensions we argue that <Psi,chi> = 0 for the previously obtained
solution of Q chi = 0, Q^{dagger} Psi = 0.
