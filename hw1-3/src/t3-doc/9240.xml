<title>
Conceptual issues in combining general relativity and quantum theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Points of conflict between the principles of general relativity and quantum
theory are highlighted. I argue that the current language of QFT is inadequete
to deal with gravity and review attempts to identify some of the features which
are likely to present in the correct theory of quantum gravity.
