<title>
Domain Walls on the Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that all branes admit worldvolume domain wall solutions. We find one
class of solutions for which the tension of the brane changes discontinuously
along the domain wall. These solutions are not supersymmetric. We argue that
there is another class of domain wall solutions which is supersymmetric. A
particular case concerns supersymmetric domain wall solutions on IIB D-5- and
NS-5-branes.
