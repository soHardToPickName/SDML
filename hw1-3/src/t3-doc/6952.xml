<title>
Generalized q-Oscillators and their Hopf Structures
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the relationships among the various forms of the $q$ oscillator
algebra and consider the conditions under which it supports a Hopf structure.
We also present a generalization of this algebra together with its
corresponding Hopf structure. Its multimode extensions are also considered.
