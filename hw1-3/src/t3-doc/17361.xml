On Seven-Brane and Instanton Solutions of Type IIB
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that magnetic seven-branes previously considered as different
objects are members of a one-parametric family of supersymmetric seven branes.
We enlarge the class of seven-branes by constructing new magnetically and also
electrically charged seven branes. The solutions display a kink-like behavior.
We also construct a solution that naturally generalizes the D-instanton.
