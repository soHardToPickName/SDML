Evaporation of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  The formation of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in the S-wave
approximation can be described, near the event horizon, by an effective
solvable model. The corresponding one-loop quantum theory remains solvable and
allows to follow analytically the evaporation process which is shown to require
an infinite amount of time.
