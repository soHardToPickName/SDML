Gauge Fields on Tachyon Matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the rolling tachyon including the gauge fields in boundary string
field theory. We show that there are no plane wave solutions for the gauge
fields for large time. The disappearance of the plane wave solutions indicates
that there are no excitations of the gauge fields on the tachyon matter, which
is consistent with the Sen's conjecture.
