<title>
A Note on the Majorana Theory for $j=1/2$ and $j=1$ Particle States
</title>

<abstract>
  The wave equations for self/anti-self conjugate Majorana-McLennan-Case
$j=1/2$ and $j=1$ spinors, proposed by Ahluwalia, are re-written to covariant
form. The connection with the Foldy-Nigam-Bargmann-Wightman-Wigner (FNBWW) type
quantum field theory is discussed.
