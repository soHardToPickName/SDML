Conformal and Quasiconformal Realizations of Exceptional Lie Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a nonlinear realization of E_8 on a space of 57 dimensions, which
is quasiconformal in the sense that it leaves invariant a suitably defined
``light cone'' in 57 dimensions. This realization, which is related to the
Freudenthal triple system associated with the unique exceptional Jordan algebra
over the split octonions, contains previous conformal realizations of the lower
rank exceptional Lie groups on generalized space times, and in particular a
conformal realization of E_7 on a 27 dimensional vector space which we exhibit
explicitly. Possible applications of our results to supergravity and M-Theory
are briefly mentioned.
