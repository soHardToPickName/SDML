AdS_6 Interpretation of 5d Superconformal Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We explore the connection of anti-de-Sitter supergravity in six dimensions,
based on the exceptional F(4) superalgebra, and its boundary superconformal
singleton theory. The interpretation of these results in terms of a D4-D8
system and its near horizon geometry is suggested.
