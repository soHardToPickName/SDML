Nutty Bubbles
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the various time-dependent bubble spacetimes that can be
obtained from double analytic continuation of asymptotically locally flat/AdS
spacetimes with NUT charge. We find different time-dependent explicit solutions
of general relativity from double analytic continuations of Taub-Nut(-AdS) and
Kerr-Nut(-AdS) spacetimes. One solution in particular has Milne-like evolution
throughout, and another is a NUT-charged generalization of the AdS soliton.
These solutions are all four dimensional. In certain situations the NUT charge
induces an ergoregion into the bubble spacetime and in other situations it
quantitatively modifies the evolution of the bubble, as when rotation is
present. In dimensions greater than four, no consistent bubble solutions are
found that have only one timelike direction.
