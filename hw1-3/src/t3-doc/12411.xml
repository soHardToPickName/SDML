<title>
Exact renormalization group equation in presence of rescaling anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  Wilson's approach to renormalization group is reanalyzed for supersymmetric
Yang-Mills theory. Usual demonstration of exact renormalization group equation
must be modified due to the presence of the so called Konishi anomaly under the
rescaling of superfields. We carry out the explicit computation for N=1 SUSY
Yang-Mills theory with the simpler, gauge invariant regularization method,
recently proposed by Arkani-Hamed and Murayama. The result is that the
Wilsonian action S_M consists of two terms, i.e. the non anomalous term, which
obeys Polchinski's flow equation and Fujikawa-Konishi determinant contribution.
This latter is responsible for Shifman-Vainshtein relation of exact
beta-function.
