Generation of Neutrino mass in a Kalb-Ramond Background in large extra
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we investigate whether spacetime torsion induced by a
Kalb-Ramond field in a string inspired background can generate a mass for the
left-handed neutrino. We consider an Einstein-Dirac-Kalb-Ramond lagrangian in
higher dimensional spacetime with torsion generated by the Kalb-Ramond
antisymmetric field in the presence of a bulk fermion. We show that such a
coupling can generate a mass term for the four dimensional neutrino after a
suitable large radius compactification of the extra dimensions.
