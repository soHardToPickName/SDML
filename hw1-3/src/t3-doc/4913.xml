<title>
Old and New Fields on Super Riemann Surfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The ``new fields" or ``superconformal functions" on $N=1$ super Riemann
surfaces introduced recently by Rogers and Langer are shown to coincide with
the Abelian differentials (plus constants), viewed as a subset of the functions
on the associated $N=2$ super Riemann surface. We confirm that, as originally
defined, they do not form a super vector space.
