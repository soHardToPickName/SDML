Ward Identities and Anomalies in Pure W_4 Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  W_4 gravity is treated algebraically, represented by a set of transformations
on classical fields. The Ward identities of the theory are determined by
requiring the algebra to close. The general forms for the anomalies are found
by looking for solutions to the Wess-Zumino consistency conditions, and some
specific cases are considered.
