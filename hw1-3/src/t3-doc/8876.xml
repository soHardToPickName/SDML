Anti-de Sitter/CFT Correspondence in Three-Dimensional Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Anti-de Sitter supergravity models are considered in three dimensions.
Precise asymptotic conditions involving a chiral projection are given on the
Rarita-Schwinger fields. Together with the known boundary conditions on the
bosonic fields, these ensure that the asymptotic symmetry algebra is the
superconformal algebra. The classical central charge is computed and found to
be equal to the one of pure gravity. It is also indicated that the asymptotic
degrees of freedom are described by 2D "induced supergravity" and that the
boundary conditions "transmute" the non-vanishing components of the WZW
supercurrent into the supercharges.
