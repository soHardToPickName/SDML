<title>
General Solution of String Inspired Nonlinear Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the general solution of the system of coupled nonlinear equations
describing dynamics of $D$--dimensional bosonic string in the geometric (or
embedding) approach. The solution is parametrized in terms of two sets of the
left- and right-moving Lorentz harmonic variables providing a special coset
space realization of the product of two (D-2)- dimensional spheres
$S^{D-2}={SO(1,D-1) \over SO(1,1) \times SO(D-2) \semiprod K_{D-2}}.$
