Branes, Orbifolds and the Three Dimensional ${\cal N} = 2$ SCFT in the
  Large N limit
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the correspondence between the large $N$ limit of ${\cal N} = 2$
three dimensional superconformal field theories and M theory on orbifolds of
$AdS_4 \times {\bf S^7}$. We identify the brane configuration which gives
$C^3/Z_3$ as a background for the M theory in terms of a Brane Box Model or a
(p, q) web model.
  By taking the orbifold projection on the known spectrum of Kaluza-Klein
harmonics of supergravity, we obtain information about the chiral primary
operators at the orbifold singularities.
