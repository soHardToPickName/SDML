Four Dimensional 2-Brane Solution in Chiral Gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  An exact conformal field theory describing a four dimensional 2-brane
solution is found by considering a chiral gauged Wess-Zumino -Witten theory
corresponding to $SL(2, R)\times R$ , where one gauges the one dimensional
$U(1)$ subgroup together with a translation in $R$. The backgrounds for string
propagation are explicitly obtained and the target space is shown to have a
true curvature singularity.
