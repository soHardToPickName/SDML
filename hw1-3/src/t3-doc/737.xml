Absorption of photons and fermions by black holes in four dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The absorption of photons and fermions into four-dimensional black holes is
described by equations which in certain cases can be analyzed using dyadic
index techniques. The resulting absorption cross-sections for near-extremal
black holes have a form at low energies suggestive of the effective string
model. A coupling to the effective string is proposed for spin-0 and spin-1/2
fields of pure N=4 supergravity which respects the unbroken supersymmetry of
extreme black holes and correctly predicts dilaton, axion, and fermion
cross-sections up to an overall normalization.
