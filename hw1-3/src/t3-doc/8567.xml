From Seiberg-Witten invariants to topological Green-Schwarz string
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we describe the physics of equivalence of the Seiberg-Witten
invariants of 4-manifolds and certain Gromov-Witten invariants defined by
pseudo-holomorphic curves. We show that physics of the pseudo-holomorphic
curves should be governed by the N=2 Green-Schwarz string.
