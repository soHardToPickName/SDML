Reply to Comment on "Duality of x and psi in Quantum Mechanics"

  The content of the comment [hep-th/9712219] is the derivation of Eq.(13) in
Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 163 by direct differential calculus: which is
precisely the same method we used to derive it (it is in fact difficult to
imagine any other possible derivation).
