The Abelian Antighost Equation for The Standard Model in the
  `t Hooft-Background Gauge
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we study the Abelian Anti-ghost equation for the Standard Model
quantized in the 't Hooft-Background gauge. We show that this equation assures
the non-renormalization of the abelian ghost fields and prevents possible
abelian anomalies.
