Correlation functions of chiral primary operators in perturbative {\cal
  N}=4 SYM
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss recent results on two-point functions of chiral primary operators
in {\cal N}=4 SU(N) supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Our results give further
support to the belief that such correlators are not renormalized to all orders
in g and to all orders in N.
