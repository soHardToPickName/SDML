Large $N$ QCD and $q$-Deformed Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  A construction of master field describing multicolour QCD is presented. The
master fields for large N matrix theories satisfy to standard equations of
relativistic field theory but fields are quantized according $q$-deformed
commutation relations with $q=0$. These commutation relations are realized in
the Boltzmannian Fock space. The master field for gauge theory does not take
values in a finite-dimensional Lie algebra, however, there is a non-Abelian
gauge symmetry and BRST-invariance.
