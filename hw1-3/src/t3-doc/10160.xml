Light-front two-dimensional QED: Self-field approach
</title>

<abstract>
  The self-field approach to quantum electrodynamics (QED) is used to study the
bound state problem in light-front two-dimensional QED with massive matter
fields. A composite matter field describing bound states is introduced and the
relativistic bound state equation for the composite field including a
self-potential is obtained. The Hamiltonian form of the bound state equation in
terms of the invariant mass squared operator is given. The eigenvalue problem
of this operator is solved for a fixed value of the self-potential, the
corresponding eigenfunctions and the mass spectrum are found. In the case of
massless matter fields, there are no self-field terms in the bound state
equation, and the invariant mass spectrum can be evaluated explicitly. Possible
ways of deriving more complete information about the bound state spectrum are
briefly discussed.
