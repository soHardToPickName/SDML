Aspects of D-Instantons
</title>

<abstract>
  An overview over effects of D-instantons in ten dimensional IIB superstring
theory is given, including the supergravity instanton solution, instanton
induced effective interaction vertices, the conjectured $SL(2,Z)$ invariant
completion of such terms and the connection of such terms to a one loop
calculation in eleven dimensional supergravity.
