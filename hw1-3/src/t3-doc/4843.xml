<title>
Non-chiral fusion rules, structure constants of D_m minimal models
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a technique to construct, for $D_{m}$ unitary minimal models, the
non-chiral fusion rules which determines the operator content of the operator
product algebra. Using these rules we solve the bootstrap equations and
therefore determine the structure constants of these models. Through this
approach we emphasize the role played by some discrete symmetries in the
classification of minimal models.
