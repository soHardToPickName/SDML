A note on inflation and transplanckian physics
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we consider the influence of transplanckian physics on the CMBR
anisotropies produced by inflation. We consider a simple toy model that allows
for analytic calculations and argue on general grounds, based on ambiguities in
the choice of vacuum, that effects are expected with a magnitude of the order
of $H/\Lambda$, where $H$ is the Hubble constant during inflation and $\Lambda$
the scale for new physics, e.g. the Planck scale.
