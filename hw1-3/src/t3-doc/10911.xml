OPEs and 4-point Functions in AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently D'Hoker et al. (1999) computed 4-point correlation functions of
axion and dilaton fields in type IIB SUGRA on AdS_5 x S^5. We reproduce from a
CFT point of view all power law singular terms in these AdS 4-point amplitudes.
We also calculate a corresponding 4-point function in the weak coupling limit,
g_{YM}^2 N -> 0. Comparison reveals the existence of a primary operator that
contributes to these same singular terms in the weak coupling limit but which
does not contribute to the power law singular terms of the type IIB SUGRA
4-point function. We conclude that this new operator is not a chiral primary
and hence acquires a large anomalous dimension in the strong coupling regime.
