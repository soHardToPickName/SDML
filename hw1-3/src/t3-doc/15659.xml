Relativistic Particle with Torsion and Charged Particle in a Constant
  Electromagnetic Field: Identity of Evolution
</title>

<abstract>
  The identity of classical motion is established for two physically different
models, one of which is the relativistic particle with torsion, whose action
contains higher derivatives and which is the effective system for the
statistically charged particle interacting with the Chern-Simons U(1) gauge
field, and another is the (2+1)-dimensional relativistic charged particle in
external constant electromagnetic field.
