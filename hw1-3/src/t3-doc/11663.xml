Comment on the Generation Number in Orbifold Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  There has been some confusion concerning the number of $(1,1)$-forms in
orbifold compactifications of the heterotic string in numerous publications. In
this note we point out the relevance of the underlying torus lattice on this
number. We answer the question when different lattices mimic the same physics
and when this is not the case. As a byproduct we classify all symmetric
$Z_N$-orbifolds with $(2,2)$ world sheet supersymmetry obtaining also some new
ones.
