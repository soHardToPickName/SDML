<title>
The One-Loop Divergences of the Linear Gravity with the Torsion Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the role of the torsion field at the quantum level in the
affine-metric theory of gravity. One-loop counterterms are calculated in the
theory with terms quadratic in the torsion field.
