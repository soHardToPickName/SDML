Two-Loop Beta Functions Without Feynman Diagrams
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a consistency requirement between T-duality symmetry and
renormalization group flows, the two-loop metric beta function is found for a
d=2 bosonic sigma model on a generic, torsionless background. The result is
obtained without Feynman diagram calculations, and represents further evidence
that duality symmetry severely constrains renormalization flows.
