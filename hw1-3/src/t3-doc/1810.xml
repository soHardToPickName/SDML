<title>
On the geometry of non-trivially embedded branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a formal supersymmetric solution of type IIB supergravity
generalizing previously known solutions corresponding to D3 branes to
geometries without an orthogonal split between parallel and transverse
directions. The metric is given implicitly as one with respect to which a
certain connection is compatible. The case of the deformed conifold is
discussed in detail.
