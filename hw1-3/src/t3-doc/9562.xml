Standard Cosmology from Sigma-Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate (4+1)- and (5+0)-dimensional gravity coupled to a non-compact
scalar field sigma-model and a perfect fluid within the context of the
Randall-Sundrum scenario. We find cosmological solutions with a rolling fifth
radius and a family of warp factors. Included in this family are both the
original Randall-Sundrum solution and the self-tuning solution of Kachru,
Schulz and Silverstein. Our solutions exhibit conventional cosmology.
