<title>
Vacuum energy in the presence of a magnetic string with delta function
  profile
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a calculation of the ground state energy of massive spinor fields
and massive scalar fields in the background of an inhomogeneous magnetic string
with potential given by a delta function. The zeta functional regularization is
used and the lowest heat kernel coefficients are calculated. The rest of the
analytical calculation adopts the Jost function formalism. In the numerical
part of the work the renormalized vacuum energy as a function of the radius $R$
of the string is calculated and plotted for various values of the strength of
the potential. The sign of the energy is found to change with the radius. For
both scalar and spinor fields the renormalized energy shows no logarithmic
behaviour in the limit $R\to 0$, as was expected from the vanishing of the heat
kernel coefficient $A_2$, which is not zero for other types of profiles.
