<title>
Low energy effective theory for two branes system
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the low energy effective theory for two branes system solving the
bulk geometry formally in the covariant curvature formalism developed by
Shiromizu, Maeda and Sasaki. As expected, the effective theory looks like a
Einstein-scalar system. Using this theory we can discuss the cosmology and
non-linear gravity at low energy scales.
