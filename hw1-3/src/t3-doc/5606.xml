Remarks on Non-Abelian Duality in N=1 Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
Recently Seiberg has conjectured a duality symmetry connecting different
theories of the supersymmetric QCD type. We provide support for this conjecture
by analyzing a flat direction of the theory along which the two dual theories
go over to the same theory in the IR.
