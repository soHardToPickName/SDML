<title>
The reduced covariant phase space quantization of the three dimensional
  Nambu-Goto string
</title>

<abstract>
  The reduced covariant phase space associated with the three-dimensional
Euclidean Nambu-Goto action can be identified, via the Enneper-Weierstrass
representation of minimal surfaces, with the space of complex analytic
functions plus three translational zero modes. The symplectic structure induced
trough the Enneper-Weierstrass map can be explicitly computed. Quantization is
then straightforward, yielding as a result a target-space Euclidean-invariant,
positive-definite, two-dimensional quantum field theory. The physical states
are shown to correspond with particles states of integer spin and arbitrary
mass.
