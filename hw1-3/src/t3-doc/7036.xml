<title>
Renormalized scalar propagator around a dispiration
</title>

<abstract>
  The renormalized Feynman propagator for a scalar field in the background of a
cosmic dispiration (a disclination plus a screw dislocation) is derived,
opening an window to investigate vacuum polarization effects around a cosmic
string with dislocation, as well as in the bulk of an elastic solid carrying a
dispiration. The use of the propagator is illustrated by computing the
mean-square field fluctuation. Connections with a closely related background,
namely the spacetime of a spinning cosmic string, are briefly addressed.
