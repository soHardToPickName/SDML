<title>
Dynamical Abelian Projection of Gluodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  Assuming the monopole dominance, that has been proved in the lattice
gluodynamics, to hold in the continuum limit, we develop an effective scalar
field theory for QCD at large distances to describe confinement. The approach
is based on a gauge (or projection) independent formulation of the monopole
dominance and manifestly Lorentz invariant.
