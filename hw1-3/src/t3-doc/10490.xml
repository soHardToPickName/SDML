Proposal for Background Independent Berkovits' Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we would like to propose the background independent formulation
of Berkovits' superstring field theory. Then we will show that the solution of
equation of motion of this theory leads to the Berkovits' superstring field
theory formulated around particular CFT background.
