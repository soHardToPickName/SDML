Solving non-perturbative flow equations
</title>

<abstract>
  Non-perturbative exact flow equations describe the scale dependence of the
effective average action. We present a numerical solution for an approximate
form of the flow equation for the potential in a three-dimensional N-component
scalar field theory. The critical behaviour, with associated critical
exponents, can be inferred with good accuracy.
