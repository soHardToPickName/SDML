<title>
Spins and charges in Grassmann space and Kahler spinors in space of
  differential forms
</title>

<abstract>
  One of us got spins and charges of not only scalars and vectors but also of
spinors out of fields, which are antisymmetric tensor fields. Kahler got spins
of spinors out of differential forms, which again are antisymmetric tensor
fields. Using our simple Grassmann formulation of spins and charges of either
spinors or vectors and comparing it to the Dirac-Kahler formulation of spinors,
we generalize the Dirac-Kahler approach to vector internal degrees of freedom
and to charges of either spinors or vectors and tenzors and point out how at
all spinors can appear in both approaches.
