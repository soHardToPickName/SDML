TASI Lectures: Cosmology for String Theorists
</title>

<abstract>
  These notes provide a brief introduction to modern cosmology, focusing
primarily on theoretical issues. Some attention is paid to aspects of potential
interest to students of string theory, on both sides of the two-way street of
cosmological constraints on string theory and stringy contributions to
cosmology. Slightly updated version of lectures at the 1999 Theoretical
Advanced Study Institute at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
