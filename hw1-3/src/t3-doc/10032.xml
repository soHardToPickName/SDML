<title>
Quantum Field Theory as a Problem of Resummation (Short guide to using
  summability methods)
</title>

<abstract>
  Thesis includes review on the large order behaviour of perturbation theory in
quantum mechanical and field theory models; generalization of the Borel
summability and strong asymptotic conditions to various (including horn-shaped)
regions; discussion of analytic aspects of perturbation theory; examples which
demonstrate differences between the Borel summability and generalized one;
application to the Rayleigh-Schr\"{o}dinger perturbation theory and to the
definition of the operator valued functions. The new summability methods
converges in the whole Mittag-Leffeler star of an analytical function and as
such is useful for localization of singularities in the complex plane. Their
position can be calculated even analytically provided large order behaviour of
the Taylor series is known. Method can be implemented numerically as well.
