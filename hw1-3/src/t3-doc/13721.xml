<title>
SO(3) \times U(1) isometric instantons with non abelian hair in four
  dimensional string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the exact effective string vacuum backgrounds of the level $k =
81/19 SU(2,1)/U(1)$ coset model. A compact SU(2) isometry present in this seven
dimensional solution allows to interpreting it after compactification as a four
dimensional non-abelian SU(2) charged instanton with a singular submanifold and
an $SO(3) \times U(1)$ isometry. The semiclassical backgrounds, solutions of
the type II strings, present similar characteristics.
