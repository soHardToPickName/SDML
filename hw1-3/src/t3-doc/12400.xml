Fixed Charge Ensembles and Parity Breaking Terms
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently derived results for the exact induced parity-breaking term in 2+1
dimensions at finite temperature are shown to be relevant to the determination
of the free energy for fixed-charge ensembles. The partition functions for
fixed total charge corresponding to massive fermions in the presence of Abelian
and non-Abelian magnetic fields are discussed. We show that the presence of the
induced Chern-Simons term manifests itself in that the free energy depends
strongly on the relation between the external magnetic flux and the value of
the fixed charge.
