The M Theory Five-Brane and the Heterotic String
</title>

<abstract>
  Brane actions with chiral bosons present special challenges. Recent progress
in the description of the two main examples -- the M theory five-brane and the
heterotic string -- is described. Also, double dimensional reduction of the M
theory five-brane on K3 is shown to give the heterotic string.
