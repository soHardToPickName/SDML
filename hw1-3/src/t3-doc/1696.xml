<title>
New nonlocal effective action
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a new method for the calculation of the nonlocal part of the
effective action. It is based on resummation of perturbation series for the
heat kernel and its functional trace at large values of the proper time
parameter. We derive a new, essentially nonperturbative, nonlocal contribution
to the effective action in spacetimes with dimensions $d>2$.
