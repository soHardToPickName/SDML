<title>
(1,0) superparticle in a curved background and the full set of (1,0)
  supergravity constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The classical (1,0) superparticle in a curved superspace is considered. The
minimal set of constraints to be imposed on the background for correct
inclusion of interaction is found. The most general form of Siegel-type local
fermionic symmetry is presented. Local algebra of the theory is shown to be
closed off-shell and nontrivially deformed as compared to the flat one. The
requirements leading to the full set of (1,0) supergravity constraints are
presented.
