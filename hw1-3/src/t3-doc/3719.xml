Consistent Interactions in terms of the Generalized Fields Method
</title>

<abstract>
  The interactions which preserve the structure of the gauge interactions of
the free theory are introduced in terms of the generalized fields method of
solving the Batalin-Vilkovisky master equation. It is shown that by virtue of
this method the solution of the descent equations resulting from the
cohomological analysis is provided straightforwardly. The general scheme is
illustrated by applying it to spin-1 gauge field in 3 and 4 dimensions, to free
BF theory in 2-d and to the antisymmetric tensor field in any dimension. It is
shown that it reproduces the results obtained by cohomological techniques.
