<title>
The Cauchy Problem for Classical Field Equations with Ghost and Fermion
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a supergeometric interpretation of field functionals developed in
previous papers, we show that for quite a large class of systems of nonlinear
field equations with anticommuting fields, infinite-dimensional supermanifolds
(smf) of classical solutions can be constructed. Such systems arise in
classical field models used for realistic quantum field theoretic models. In
particular, we show that under suitable conditions, the smf of smooth Cauchy
data with compact support is isomorphic with an smf of corresponding classical
solutions of the model.
