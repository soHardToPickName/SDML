<title>
Orientifolds of Matrix theory and Noncommutative Geometry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study explicit solutions for orientifolds of Matrix theory compactified on
noncommutative torus. As quotients of torus, cylinder, Klein bottle and
M\"obius strip are applicable as orientifolds. We calculate the solutions using
Connes, Douglas and Schwarz's projective module solution, and investigate
twisted gauge bundle on quotient spaces as well. They are Yang-Mills theory on
noncommutative torus with proper boundary conditions which define the geometry
of the dual space.
