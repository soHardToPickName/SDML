<title>
On The Symmetries Of Topological Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We display properties of the general formalism which associates to any given
gauge symmetry a topological action and a system of topological BRST and
anti-BRST equations. We emphasize the distinction between the antighosts of the
geometrical BRST equations and the antighosts occuring in field theory. We
propose a transmutation mechanism between these objects. We illustrate our
general presentation by examples.
