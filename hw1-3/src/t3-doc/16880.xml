<title>
Induced Angular Momentum in (2+1)-Dimensional Spinor Electrodynamics in
  Curved Space
</title>

<abstract>
  Effects due to fermion-vacuum polarization by an external static magnetic
field are considered in a two-dimensional noncompact curved space with a
nontrivial topology. An expression for the vacuun angular momentum is obtained.
Like the vacuum fermion number, it proves to be dependent on the global
characteristics of the field and space.
