<title>
Spinors, Relativity and Nonlocality
</title>

<abstract>
  The Ryder relation between left- and right- spinors has been generalized in
my previous works. On this basis Ahluwalia presented a physical content
following from this generalization. It is related to non-locality. A similar
conclusion can be drawn on the basis of a generalization of the Sakurai-Gersten
consideration. I correct several calculating and conceptual misunderstandings
of the previous works.
