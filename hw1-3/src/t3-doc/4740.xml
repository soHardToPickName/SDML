Residual Representations of Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
  Spacetime is modelled by binary relations - by the classes of the
automorphisms $\GL(\C^2)$ of a complex 2-dimensional vector space with respect
to the definite unitary subgroup $\U(2)$. In extension of Feynman propagators
for particle quantum fields representing only the tangent spacetime structure,
global spacetime representations are given, formulated as residues using
energy-momentum distributions with the invariants as singularities. The
associatated quantum fields are characterized by two invariant masses - for
time and position - supplementing the one mass for the definite unitary
particle sector with another mass for the indefinite unitary interaction sector
without asymptotic particle interpretation.
