<title>
Logarithmic Conformal Field Theory and Seiberg-Witten Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The periods of arbitrary abelian forms on hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces, in
particular the periods of the meromorphic Seiberg-Witten differential, are
shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the conformal blocks of
correlation functions of the rational logarithmic conformal field theory with
central charge c=c(2,1)=-2. The fields of this theory precisely simulate the
branched double covering picture of a hyperelliptic curve, such that generic
periods can be expressed in terms of certain generalised hypergeometric
functions, namely the Lauricella functions of type F_D.
