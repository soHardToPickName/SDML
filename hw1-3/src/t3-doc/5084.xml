<title>
Ultra-Violet Infinities and Counterterms in Higher Dimensional
  Yang-Mills
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we investigate the ultra-violet behaviour of four-point
one-loop gluon amplitudes in dimensions greater than four coupled to various
particles types. We discuss the structure of the counterterms and their
inherent symmetries.
