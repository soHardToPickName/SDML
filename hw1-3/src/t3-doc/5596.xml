A Note on Calogero-Sutherland Model, W_n Singular Vectors and
  Generalized Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
We review some recent results on the Calogero-Sutherland model with emphasis
upon its algebraic aspects. We give integral formulae for excited states (Jack
polynomials) of this model and their relations with W_n singular vectors and
generalized matrix models.
