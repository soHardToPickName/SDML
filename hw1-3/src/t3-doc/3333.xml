On the Supersymmetry of Non-BPS D-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we extend the boundary string field theory action for a non-BPS
D-brane to the one including the target space fermions and the nonlinear
supersymmetry with 32 supercharges up to some order. This is based on the idea
that the vacuum with a non-BPS D-brane belongs to the spontaneously broken
phase of the supersymmetry. As a result, we find that the action is almost
uniquely determined up to the field redefinition ambiguities.
