A Covariant Entropy Conjecture
</title>

<abstract>
  We conjecture the following entropy bound to be valid in all space-times
admitted by Einstein's equation: Let A be the area of any two-dimensional
surface. Let L be a hypersurface generated by surface-orthogonal null geodesics
with non-positive expansion. Let S be the entropy on L. Then S does not exceed
A/4.
  We present evidence that the bound can be saturated, but not exceeded, in
cosmological solutions and in the interior of black holes. For systems with
limited self-gravity it reduces to Bekenstein's bound. Because the conjecture
is manifestly time reversal invariant, its origin cannot be thermodynamic, but
must be statistical. Thus it places a fundamental limit on the number of
degrees of freedom in nature.
