Calculating Casimir Energies in Renormalizable Quantum Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Quantum vacuum energy has been known to have observable consequences since
1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel uncharged
plates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.
Casimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for a
conducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Other
geometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Local
effects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been studied
by several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined such
calculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum field
theory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stress
results may be suspect. Here we show that the examples considered in their work
are misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two dimensions a
circular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for massless fields,
while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer the corresponding
Casimir energy arising from massless fields interior and exterior to a
hyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized that the
Casimir energy for massive fields is divergent for $D\ne1$. These conclusions
are reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading Feynman diagram in $D$
and three dimensions. There is therefore no doubt of the validity of the
conventional finite Casimir calculations.
