<title>
The Large N Limit of ${\cal N}=1$ Field Theories from F Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study AdS/CFT correspondence in four dimensional N=1 field theories
realized on the worldvolume of D3 branes near the intersections between D7 and
D7' branes in F theory studied by Aharony et al. We consider the
compactification of F theory on elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds
corresponding to two sets of parallel D7 branes sharing six spacetime
directions. This can be viewed as orbifolds of six torus T^6 by Z_p x Z_q (p,
q=2, 3, 4, 6). We find the large N spectrum of chiral primary operators by
exploiting the property of AdS/CFT correspondence. Moreover, we discuss
supergravity solutions for D3 branes in D7 and D7' branes background.
