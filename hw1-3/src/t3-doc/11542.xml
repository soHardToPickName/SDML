<title>
Higher dimensional black holes and supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  It has recently been shown that the uniqueness theorem for stationary black
holes cannot be extended to five dimensions. However, uniqueness is an
important assumption of the string theory black hole entropy calculations. This
paper justifies this assumption by proving a uniqueness theorem for
supersymmetric black holes in five dimensions. Some remarks concerning general
properties of non-supersymmetric higher dimensional black holes are made. It is
conjectured that there exist new families of stationary higher dimensional
black hole solutions with fewer symmetries than any known solution.
