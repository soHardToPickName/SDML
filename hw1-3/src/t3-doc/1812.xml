On the Electric Charge of Monopoles at Finite Temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the electric charge at finite temperature $T$ for non-Abelian
monopoles in spontaneously broken gauge theories with a CP violating
$\theta$-term. A careful treatment of dyon's gauge degrees of freedom shows
that Witten formula for the dyon charge at $T=0$, $ Q = e(n - \theta/2\pi) $,
remains valid at $T \ne 0$.
