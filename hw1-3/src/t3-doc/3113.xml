On Ghost Structure of Vacuum Superstring Field Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  After discussing the general form of the kinetic operator around the tachyon
vacuum, we determine the specific form of the pure-ghost kinetic operator Q^ by
requiring the twist invariance of the action. We obtain a novel result that the
Grassmann-even piece Q_even of Q^ must act differently on GSO(+) sector and on
GSO(-) sector to preserve the twist invariance, and show that this structure is
crucial for gauge invariance of the action. With this choice of Q^, we
construct a solution in an approximation scheme which is conjectured to
correspond to a non-BPS D9-brane. We consider both 0-picture cubic and
Berkovits' non-polynomial superstring field theories for the NS sector.
