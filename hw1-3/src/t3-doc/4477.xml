<title>
Quaternionic Taub-NUT from the harmonic space approach
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the harmonic space technique to construct explicitly a quaternionic
extension of the Taub-NUT metric. It depends on two parameters, the first being
the Taub-NUT `mass' and the second one the cosmological constant.
