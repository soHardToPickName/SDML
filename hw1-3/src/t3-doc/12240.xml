<title>
A square root of the harmonic oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
Allowing for the inclusion of the parity operator, it is possible to construct
an oscillator model whose Hamiltonian admits an EXACT square root, which is
different from the conventional approach based on creation and annihilation
operators. We outline such a model, the method of solution and some
generalizations.
