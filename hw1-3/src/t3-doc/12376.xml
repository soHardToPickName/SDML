<title>
Short Distance Expansion from the Dual Representation of Infinite
  Dimensional Lie Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We compute the short distance expansion of fields or operators that live in
the coadjoint representation of an infinite dimensional Lie algebra by using
only properties of the adjoint representation and its dual. We explicitly
compute the short distance expansion for the duals of the Virasoro algebra,
affine Lie Algebras and the geometrically realized N-extended supersymmetric GR
Virasoro algebra.
