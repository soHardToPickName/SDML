Construction of multi-instantons in eight dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider an eight-dimensional local octonionic theory with the
seven-sphere playing the role of the gauge group. Duality conditions for two-
and four-forms in eight dimensions are related. Dual fields--octonionic
instantons--solve an 8D generalization of the Yang-Mills equation. Modifying
the ADHM construction of 4D instantons, we find general $k$-instanton 8D
solutions which depends on $16k-7$ effective parameters.
