<title>
BRST Analysis of QCD_2 as a Perturbed WZW Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Integrability of Quantum Chromodynamics in 1+1 dimensions has recently been
suggested by formulating it as a perturbed conformal Wess-Zumino-Witten Theory.
The present paper further elucidates this formulation, by presenting a detailed
BRST analysis.
