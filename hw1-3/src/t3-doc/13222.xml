<title>
Monopole Constituents inside SU(n) Calorons
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple result for the action density of the SU(n) charge one
periodic instantons - or calorons - with arbitrary non-trivial Polyakov loop
P_oo at spatial infinity. It is shown explicitly that there are n lumps inside
the caloron, each of which represents a BPS monopole, their masses being
related to the eigenvalues of P_oo. A suitable combination of the ADHM
construction and the Nahm transformation is used to obtain this result.
