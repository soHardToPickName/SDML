<title>
Electroweak Parity Breaking by Isospin Deformation and the Copenhagen
  Vacuum
</title>

<abstract>
  From the global chiral SU(2)*U(1) that appears in the electroweak Left-Right
Model in the fundamental representation, a continuous transition to the
representation of the minimal Standard Model is considered in the Cartan
subalgebra of the right-handed sector. The connecting parameter is the
splitting of U(1)_R quantum numbers. It is a deformation parameter, breaks
SU(2)_R and parity and is proportional to an isomagnetic field, leading to
Copenhagen type vacuum. A simple mapping on the fundamental representation of
SU(2)_q gives the splitting in terms of q.
