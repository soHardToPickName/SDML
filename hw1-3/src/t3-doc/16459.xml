A Parity Invariant Regularization in 3-D Quantum Electrodynamics
</title>

<abstract>
  We regularize the 3-D quantum electrodynamics by a parity invariant
Pauli-Villars regularization method. We find that in the perturbation theory
the Chern-Simons term is not induced in the massless fermion case and induced
in the massive fermion case.
