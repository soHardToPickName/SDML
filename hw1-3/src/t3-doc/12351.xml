Open P-Branes

<abstract>
  It is shown that many of the $p$-branes of type II string theory and $d=11$
supergravity can have boundaries on other $p$-branes. The rules for when this
can and cannot occur are derived from charge conservation. For example it is
found that membranes in $d=11$ supergravity and IIA string theory can have
boundaries on fivebranes. The boundary dynamics are governed by the self-dual
$d=6$ string. A collection of $N$ parallel fivebranes contains $\half N(N-1)$
self-dual strings which become tensionless as the fivebranes approach one
another.
