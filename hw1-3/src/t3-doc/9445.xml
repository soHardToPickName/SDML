<title>
The Mixed Non-Abelian Coulomb Gas in Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  The statistical mechanics of a mixed gas of adjoint and fundamental
representation charges interacting via 1+1-dimensional U(N) gauge fields is
investigated. In the limit of large N we show that there is a first order
deconfining phase transition for low densities of fundamental charges. As the
density of fundamental charges becomes comparable to the adjoint charge density
the phase transition becomes a third order one.
