W-(infinity)-algebras in n complex dimensions and Kodaira-Spencer
  deformations : a symplectic approach
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the notion of W_\infty-algebra originally carried out over a
(compact) Riemann surface can be extended to n complex dimensional (compact)
manifolds within a symplectic geometrical setup. The relationships with the
Kodaira-Spencer deformation theory of complex structures are discussed.
Subsequently, some field theoretical aspects at the classical level are briefly
underlined.
