Exact Results in Non-Supersymmetric Large N Orientifold Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider non-supersymmetric large N orientifold field theories.
Specifically, we discuss a gauge theory with a Dirac fermion in the
anti-symmetric tensor representation. We argue that, at large N and in a large
part of its bosonic sector, this theory is non-perturbatively equivalent to N=1
SYM, so that exact results established in the latter (parent) theory also hold
in the daughter orientifold theory. In particular, the non-supersymmetric
theory has an exactly calculable bifermion condensate, exactly degenerate
parity doublets, and a vanishing cosmological constant (all this to leading
order in 1/N).
