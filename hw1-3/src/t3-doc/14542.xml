Large-N Quenching in the Kazakov-Migdal Model
</title>

<abstract>
  To study the behavior of the Kazakov-Migdal at large N the quenched momentum
prescription with constraints for treating the large N limit of gauge theories
is used. It is noted that it leads to a quartic dependence of an action on
unitary matrix instead of a quadratic dependence discussed in previous
considerations. Therefore the model is not exactly solvable in the weak
coupling limit. An approximation procedure for investigation of the model is
outlined. In this approximation an indication to a phase transition for $d<4,8$
with $\beta_{cr}=\frac{1}{d-4,8}$ is obtained.
