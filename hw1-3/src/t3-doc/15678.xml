<title>
Gravitation, the Quantum, and Cosmological Constant
</title>

<abstract>
  The arguments of statistical nature for the existence of constituents of
active gravitational masses are presented. The present paper proposes a basis
for microscopic theory of universal gravitation. Questions like the relation of
cosmological constant and quantum theory, black hole radiance and the nature of
inertia are addressed. This paper is the second in the series of papers
published in Acta Physica Polonica {\bf B}.
