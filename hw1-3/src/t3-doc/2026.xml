Modular Invariance, Finiteness, and Misaligned Supersymmetry: New
  Constraints on the Numbers of Physical String States
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the generic distribution of bosonic and fermionic states at
all mass levels in non-supersymmetric string theories, and find that a hidden
``misaligned supersymmetry'' must always appear in the string spectrum. We show
that this misaligned supersymmetry is ultimately responsible for the finiteness
of string amplitudes in the absence of full spacetime supersymmetry, and
therefore the existence of misaligned supersymmetry provides a natural
constraint on the degree to which spacetime supersymmetry can be broken in
string theory without destroying the finiteness of string amplitudes.
Misaligned supersymmetry also explains how the requirements of modular
invariance and absence of physical tachyons generically affect the distribution
of states throughout the string spectrum, and implicitly furnishes a
two-variable generalization of some well-known results in the theory of modular
functions.
