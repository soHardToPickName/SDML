Comment about UV regularization of basic commutators in string theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently proposed by Hwang, Marnelius and Saltsidis zeta regularization of
basic commutators in string theories is generalized to the string models with
non-trivial vacuums. It is shown that implementation of this regularization
implies the cancellation of dangerous terms in the commutators between Virasoro
generators, which break Jacobi identity.
