<title>
Area Potentials and Deformation Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Systems built out of N-body interactions, beyond 2-body interactions, are
formulated on the plane, and investigated classically and quantum mechanically
(in phase space). Their Wigner Functions--the density matrices in phase-space
quantization--are given and analyzed.
