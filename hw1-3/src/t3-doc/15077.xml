<title>
Functional determinants and effective actions:Corrigenda
</title>

<abstract>
  Some calculational errors in expressions derived previously by the first
author for the effective action, or equivalently for the functional
determinant, on sectors of a spherical cap are corrected. The formula for the
change in the effective action under Weyl rescalings in the three dimensional
case is also amended.
