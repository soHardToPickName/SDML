Some Comments on N=1 Gauge Theories from Wrapped Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss various aspects of gauge theories realized on the world-volume of
wrapped branes. In particular we analyze the coupling of SYM operators to
space-time fields both in N=1 and N=2 models and give a description of the
gluino condensate in the Maldacena-Nunez N=1 solution. We also explore the
seven dimensional BPS equations relevant for these solutions and their
generalizations.
