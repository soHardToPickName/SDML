Supergravity, Supermembrane and M(atrix) model on PP-Waves
</title>

<abstract>
  In the first part of this paper, we study the back-reaction of large-N light
cone momentum on the maximally supersymmetric anti-pp-wave background. This
gives the type IIA geometry of large-N D0-branes on curved space with fluxes.
By taking an appropriate decoupling limit, we conjecture a new duality between
string theory on that background and dual field theory on D0-branes which we
derive by calculating linear coupling terms. Agreement of decoupling
quantities, SO(3) \times SO(6) isometry and Higgs branch on both theories are
shown. Also we find whenever dual field theory is weakly coupled, the curvature
of the geometry is large. In the second part of this paper, we derive the
supermembrane action on a general pp-wave background only through the
properties of null Killing vector and through this, derive the Matrix model.
