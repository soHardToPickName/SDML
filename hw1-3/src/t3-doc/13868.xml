The Super-potential and Holomorphic properties of the MQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the holomorphic properties of the MQCD by comparing the
super-potentials in MQCD and the gauge theory. First we show that the
super-potential defined as an integral of three form is NOT appropriate for
generic situation with quarks. We report a resolution of the problem which
works for the brane configurations of 90 degree rotation, including the true
SQCD. The new definition does not need auxiliary surface and can be reduced to
a contour integral for some cases. We find relation beetween the new and old
definitions, which is verified by explicit calculation for SU(N), SO(N), Sp(N)
simple groups with $F$ of massive quarks.
