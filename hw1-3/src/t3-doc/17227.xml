<title>
N=8 BPS Black Holes with 1/2 or 1/4 Supersymmetry and Solvable Lie
  Algebra Decompositions
</title>

<abstract>
  In the context of N=8 supergravity we construct the general form of BPS
0--branes that preserve either 1/2 or 1/4 of the original supersymmetry. We
show how such solutions are related to suitable decompositions of the 70
dimensional solvable Lie algebra that describes the scalar field sector. We
compare our new results to those obtained in a previous paper for the case of
1/8 supersymmetry preserving black holes. Each of the three cases is based on a
different solvable Lie algebra decomposition and leads to a different structure
of the scalar field evolution and of their fixed values at the horizon of the
black hole.
