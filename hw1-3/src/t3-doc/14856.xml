<title>
T-duality of large N QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that non-supersymmetric large N QCD compactified on T^2 exhibits
properties characteristic of an SL(2,Z) T-duality. The kahler structure on
which this SL(2,Z) acts is given by $m/N + i\Lambda^2 A$, where A is the area
of the torus, m is the 't Hooft magnetic flux on the torus, and $\Lambda^2$ is
the QCD string tension.
