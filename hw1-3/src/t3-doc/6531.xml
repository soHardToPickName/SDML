Exact Results on Twist Anomaly
</title>

<abstract>
  In vacuum string field theory, the sliver state solution has been proposed as
a candidate of a D-brane configuration. Physical observables associated with
this solution, such as its energy density and the tachyon mass, are written in
terms of the Neumann coefficients. These observables, though vanish naively due
to twist symmetry, acquire non-vanishing values arising from their singular
behavior. Therefore, this phenomenon is called twist anomaly. In this paper we
present an analytical derivation of these physical observables with the help of
the star algebra spectroscopy. We also identify in our derivation the origin of
the twist anomaly in the finite-size matrix regularization.
