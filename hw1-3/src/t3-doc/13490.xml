Instantons, Compactification and S-duality in N=4 SUSY Yang-Mills Theory
  I
</title>

<abstract>
  We study N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group SU(2)
compactified to three dimensions on a circle of circumference beta. The eight
fermion terms in the effective action on the Coulomb branch are determined
exactly, for all beta, assuming the existence of an interacting Spin(8)
invariant fixed point at the origin. The resulting formulae are manifestly
invariant under the SL(2,Z) duality of four dimensional N=4 SYM and lead to
interesting quantitative predictions for instanton effects in gauge theory and
in Type II string theory.
