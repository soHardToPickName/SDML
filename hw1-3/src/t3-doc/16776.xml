<title>
Large N expansion of the 2-matrix model
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a method, based on loop equations, to compute recursively all the
terms in the large $N$ topological expansion of the free energy for the
2-hermitian matrix model. We illustrate the method by computing the first
subleading term, i.e. the free energy of a statistical physics model on a
discretized torus.
