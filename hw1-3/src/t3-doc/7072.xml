<title>
Duality for the Non-Specialist
</title>

<abstract>
  This is the written version of a series of lectures reviewing the basics of
duality as applied to p-forms and sigma-models. The ideas are introduced by way
of worked examples, often quite detailed. Our approach is very pedestrian and
the presentation is aimed at non-specialists, such as e.g. graduate students.
