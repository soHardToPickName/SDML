<title>
Poincar\'{e} series of quantum matrix bialgebras determined by a pair of
  quantum spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  The dimension of the third homogeneous component of a matrix quantum
bialgebra, determined by pair of quantum spaces, is calculated. The
Poincar\'{e} series of some deformations of $GL(n)$ is calculated. A new
deformation of $GL(3)$ with the correct dimension is given.
