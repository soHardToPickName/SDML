Energy-Charge Dependence for Q-Balls
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that many numerically established properties of Q-balls can be
understood in terms of analytic approximations for a certain type of potential.
In particular, we derive an explicit formula between the energy and the charge
of the Q-ball valid for a wide range of the charge Q.
