Supersymmetry in Singular Quantum Mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The breaking of supersymmetry due to singular potentials in supersymmetric
quantum mechanics is critically analyzed. It is shown that, when properly
regularized, these potentials respect supersymmetry, even when the
regularization parameter is removed.
