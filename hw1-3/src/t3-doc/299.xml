Foliations with nonvanishing GV-class and gauge invariance
</title>

<abstract>
  In many aspects the most complicated noncommutative spaces correspond to
foliated manifolds with nonvanishing Godbillon-Vey class. We argue that gauge
invariance probably prevents a foliated manifold from creating resilient leaves
and thus resulting in having nonvanishing GV-class. So these spaces which are
of the highest noncommutativity are not likely to appear in gauge theories.
