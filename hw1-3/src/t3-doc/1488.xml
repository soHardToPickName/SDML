Gauged Supergravity Vacua From Intersecting Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  Domain wall and electrovac solutions of gauged N=4 D=4 supergravity, with
gauge group SU(2) or SU(2)xSU(2), are interpreted as supersymmetric
Kaluza-Klein vacua of N=1 D=10 supergravity. These vacua are shown to be the
near-horizon geometries of certain intersecting brane solutions.
