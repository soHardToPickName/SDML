Introduction to Black Hole Microscopy
</title>

<abstract>
  The aim of these notes is both to review the standard understanding of the
Hawking effect, and to discuss the modifications to this understanding that
might be required by new physics at short distances. The fundamentals of the
Unruh effect are reviewed, and then the Hawking effect is explained as a
``gravitational Unruh effect", with particular attention to the
state-dependence of this picture. The order of magnitude of deviations from the
thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation is estimated under various hypotheses on
physics at short distances. The behavior of black hole radiation in a linear
model with altered short distance physics---the Unruh model---is discussed in
detail. [Based on lectures given at the First Mexican School on Gravitation and
Mathematical Physics, Guanajuato, December 1994.]
