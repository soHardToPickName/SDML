BPS Walls and Junctions in ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY Nonlinear Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  The ${\cal N}=1$ SUSY nonlinear sigma models in four spacetime dimensions are
studied to obtain BPS walls and junctions. A nonlinear sigma model with a
single chiral scalar superfield is found which has a moduli space of the
topology of $S^1$ and admits BPS walls and junctions connecting arbitrary
points in moduli space. New BPS junction solutions connecting $N$ discrete
vacua are also found for nonlinear sigma models with several chiral scalar
superfields. More detailed exposition of our results can be found in
Ref.\cite{NNS}.
