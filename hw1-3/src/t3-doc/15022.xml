D-branes on the Quintic
</title>

<abstract>
  We study D-branes on the quintic CY by combining results from several
directions: general results on holomorphic curves and vector bundles, stringy
geometry and mirror symmetry, and the boundary states in Gepner models recently
constructed by Recknagel and Schomerus, to begin sketching a picture of
D-branes in the stringy regime. We also make first steps towards computing
superpotentials on the D-brane world-volumes.
