A Note on non-supersymmetric open-string orbifolds with a quantised B_ab
</title>

<abstract>
  In this short note we review the main features of open-string orbifolds with
a quantised flux for the NS-NS antisymmetric tensor in the context of the open
descendants of non-supersymmetric asymmetric orbifolds with a vanishing
cosmological constant.
