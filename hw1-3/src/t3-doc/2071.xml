<title>
The Dynamics of Relativistic Hypersurfaces
</title>

<abstract>
  A dynamical theory of hypersurface deformations is presented. It is shown
that a (n+1)-dimensional space-time can be always foliated by pure
deformations, governed by a non zero Hamiltonian. Quantum deformations states
are defined by Schroedinger's equation constructed with the corresponding
deformation Hamiltonian operator, interpreted as the generator of the
deformation diffeomorphism group. Applications to quantum gravity and to a
modified Kaluza-Klein theory are proposed.
