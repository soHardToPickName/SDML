Macroscopic Loop Amplitudes in Two-Dimensional Dilaton Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Macroscopic loop amplitudes are obtained for the dilation gravity in
two-dimensions. The dependence on the macroscopic loop length $l$ is completely
determined by using the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the mini-superspace
approximation. The dependence on the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is also
determined by using the scaling argument in addition.
