Electron-electron attractive interaction in Maxwell-Chern-Simons QED3 at
  zero temperature
</title>

<abstract>
  One discusses the issue of low-energy electron-electron bound states in the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons model coupled to QED3 with spontaneous breaking of a local
U(1)-symmetry. The scattering potential, in the non-relativistic limit,
steaming from the electron-electron Moller scattering, mediated by the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca gauge field and the Higgs scalar, might be
attractive by fine-tuning properly the physical parameters of the model.
