Electric/magnetic duality and its stringy origins
</title>

<abstract>
  We review electric/magnetic duality in $N=4$ (and certain $N=2$) globally
supersymmetric gauge theories and show how this duality, which relates strong
to weak coupling, follows as a consequence of a string/string duality. Black
holes, eleven dimensions and supermembranes also have a part to play in the big
picture.
