<title>
2d quantum dilaton gravity as/versus finite dimensional quantum
  mechanical systems
</title>

<abstract>
  I present the ``Chern--Simons'' formulation of generalized 2d dilaton
gravity, summarize its Hamiltonian quantization (reduced phase space and Dirac
quantization) and briefly discuss the statistical mechanical entropy of 2d
black holes. Focus is put on the close relation to finite dimensional point
particle systems.
