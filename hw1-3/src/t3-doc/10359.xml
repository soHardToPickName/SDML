Thermal Quantum Fields in Static Electromagnetic Backgrounds
</title>

<abstract>
  We present and discuss, at a general level, new mathematical results on the
spatial nonuniformity of thermal quantum fields coupled minimally to static
background electromagnetic potentials. Two distinct examples are worked through
in some detail: uniform (parallel and perpendicular) background electric and
magnetic fields coupled to a thermal quantum scalar field.
