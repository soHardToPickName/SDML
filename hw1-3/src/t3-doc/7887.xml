Turbulence as a constrained system
</title>

<abstract>
  Hydrodynamic turbulence is studied as a constrained system from the point of
view of metafluid dynamics. We present a Lagrangian description for this new
theory of turbulence inspired from the analogy with electromagnetism.
Consequently it is a gauge theory. This new approach to the study of turbulence
tends to renew the optimism to solve the difficult problem of turbulence. As a
constrained system, turbulence is studied in the Dirac and Faddeev-Jackiw
formalisms giving the Dirac brackets. An important result is that we show these
brackets are the same in and out of the inertial range, giving the way to
quantize turbulence.
