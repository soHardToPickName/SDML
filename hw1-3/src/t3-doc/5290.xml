Tensionless Branes and Discrete Gauge Symmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the tensionless branes found recently on non-BPS D-branes using
non-commutative field theory are in fact gauge equivalent to the vacuum under a
discrete gauge symmetry. We also give a simple construction of the D(2p)-branes
in IIA theory starting from a single non-BPS D9-brane.
