Summing up the perturbation series in the Schwinger Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Perturbation series for the electron propagator in the Schwinger Model is
summed up in a direct way by adding contributions coming from individual
Feynman diagrams. The calculation shows the complete agreement between
nonperturbative and perturbative approaches.
