<title>
On Matrix Models of M5-branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We compare the $(0,2)$ theory of the single M5 brane decoupled from gravity
in the lightcone with transverse $R^4$, and a matrix model description in terms
of quantum mechanics on instanton moduli space. We give some tests of the
Matrix model in the case of multi fivebranes on $R^4$. We extract constraints
on the operator content of the field theory of the multi-fivebrane system by
analyzing the Matrix model. We also begin a study of compactifications of the
$(0,2)$ theory in this framework, arguing that for large compactification scale
the $(0,2)$ theory is described by super-quantum mechanics on appropriate
instanton moduli spaces.
