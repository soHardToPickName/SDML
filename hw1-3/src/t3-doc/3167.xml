D-brane Models with Non-Linear Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a class of type I string models with supersymmetry broken on the
world-volume of some D-branes and vanishing tree-level potential. Despite the
non-supersymmetric spectrum, supersymmetry is non-linearly realized on these
D-branes, while it is spontaneously broken in the bulk by Scherk-Schwarz
boundary conditions. These models can easily accommodate 3-branes with
interesting gauge groups and chiral fermions. We also study the effective field
theory and in particular we compute the four-fermion couplings of the localized
Goldstino with the matter fermions on the brane.
