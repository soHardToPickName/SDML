<title>
Non-Existence of Local Integrals of Motion in the Multi-Deformed Ising
  Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We confirm the non-integrability of the multi-deformed Ising Model, an
already expected result. After deforming with the energy operator $\phi_{1,3}$
we use the Majorana free fermionic representation for the massive theory to
show that, besides the trivial one, no local integrals of motion can be built
in the theory arising from perturbing with both energy and spin operators.
