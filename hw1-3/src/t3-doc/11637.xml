Vertex Operators in 2K Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  A formula is proposed which expresses free fermion fields in 2K dimensions in
terms of the Cartan currents of the free fermion current algebra. This leads,
in an obvious manner, to a vertex operator construction of nonabelian free
fermion current algebras in arbitrary even dimension. It is conjectured that
these ideas may generalize to a wide class of conformal field theories.
