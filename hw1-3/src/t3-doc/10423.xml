Graded q-pseudo-differential Operators and Supersymmetric Algebras
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a supersymmetric generalization of the sine algebra and the quantum
algebra $U_{t}(sl(2))$. Making use of the $q$-pseudo-differential operators
graded with a fermionic algebra, we obtain a supersymmetric extension of sine
algebra. With this scheme we also get a quantum superalgebra $U_{t}(sl(2/1)$.
