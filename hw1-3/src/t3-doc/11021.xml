Casimir-Polder energy and dilute dielectric ball : nondispersive case
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply general formalism of quantum field theory and addition theorem for
Bessel functions to derive formula for the Casimir-Polder energy of interaction
between a polarizable particle and a dilute dielectric ball and Casimir energy
of a dilute dielectric ball. The correspondence between the Casimir-Polder
formula and Casimir energy of a dilute dielectric ball is shown. Different
approaches to the problem of Casimir energy of a dielectric ball are reviewed
and analysed by use of addition theorem for Bessel functions.
