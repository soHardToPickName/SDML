<title>
Non-conformally flat bulk spacetime and the 3-brane world
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that for non-conformally flat bulk spacetime, there exist no bound
modes for zero mass graviton on the 3-brane. The brane world model is therefore
unstable for the bulk spacetime being different from the conformally flat anti
- de Sitter space.
