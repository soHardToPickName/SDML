<title>
Collective fermionic excitations in systems with a large chemical
  potential
</title>

<abstract>
  We study fermionic excitations in a cold ultrarelativistic plasma. We
construct explicitly the quantum states associated with the two branches which
develop in the excitation spectrum as the chemical potential is raised. The
collective nature of the long wavelength excitations is clearly exhibited.
