Open Branes and Little Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  This is a short review of the newly discovered ODp-theories that are
non-gravitational six-dimensional theories defined as the decoupling limit of
NS5-branes in the presence of a near-critical (p+1)-form RR fields. We discuss
the motivation for these new theories, their definitions and properties, and
their relation to NCOS theory, OM theory and Little String Theory, focusing on
the cases p=1,2.
