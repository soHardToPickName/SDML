<title>
The Conformal Spin and Statistics Theorem
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove the equality between the statistics phase and the conformal
univalence for a superselection sector with finite index in Conformal Quantum
Field Theory on $S^1$. A relevant point is the description of the PCT symmetry
and the construction of the global conjugate charge.
