<title>
Bosonized Formulation of Lattice QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  Problems in lattice gauge models with fermions are discussed. A new bosonic
Hermitean effective action for lattice QCD with dynamical quarks is presented.
In distinction of the previous version, it does not include constraints and is
better suited for Monte-Carlo simulations.
