<title>
Monopoles in non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate monopole solutions for the Born-Infeld Higgs system. We
analyze numerically these solutions and compare them with the standard 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopoles. We also discuss the existence of a critical value of
beta (the Born-Infeld "absolute field parameter") below which no regular
solution exists.
