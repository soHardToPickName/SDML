<title>
Entropy Production via Particle Production
</title>

<abstract>
  I critically examine the notion of ``irreversibility,'' and discuss in what
sense it applies to the spontaneous creation of particles in external fields.
The investigation reveals that particle creation in very strong fields can only
be described by a non-Markovian transport theory.
