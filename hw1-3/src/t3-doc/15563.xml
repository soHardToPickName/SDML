<title>
Normalization of Off-shell Boundary State, g-function and Zeta Function
  Regularization
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the model in two dimensions with boundary quadratic deformation
(BQD), which has been discussed in tachyon condensation. The partition function
of this model (BQD) on a cylinder is determined, using the method of zeta
function regularization. We show that, for closed channel partition function, a
subtraction procedure must be introduced in order to reproduce the correct
results at conformal points. The boundary entropy (g-function) is determined
from the partition function and the off-shell boundary state. We propose and
consider a supersymmetric generalization of BQD model, which includes a
boundary fermion mass term, and check the validity of the subtraction
procedure.
