Open String on Symmetric Product
</title>

<abstract>
  We develop some basic properties of the open string on the symmetric product
which is supposed to describe the open string field theory in discrete
lightcone quantization (DLCQ). After preparing the consistency conditions of
the twisted boundary conditions for Annulus/M\"obius/Klein Bottle amplitudes in
generic non-abelian orbifold, we classify the most general solutions of the
constraints when the discrete group is $S_N$. We calculate the corresponding
orbifold amplitudes from two viewpoints -- from the boundary state formalism
and from the trace over the open string Hilbert space. It is shown that the
topology of the world sheet for the short string and that of the long string in
general do not coincide. For example the annulus sector for the short string
contains all the sectors (torus, annulus, Klein bottle, M\"obius strip) of the
long strings. The boundary/cross-cap states of the short strings are classified
into three categories in terms of the long string, the ordinary boundary and
the cross-cap states, and the ``joint'' state which describes the connection of
two short strings. We show that the sum of the all possible boundary conditions
is equal to the exponential of the sum of the irreducible amplitude -- one body
amplitude of long open (closed) strings. This is typical structure of DLCQ
partition function. We examined that the tadpole cancellation condition in our
language and derived the well-known gauge group $SO(2^{13})$.
