Nondegenerate Super-Anti-de Sitter Algebra and a Superstring Action
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an Anti-de Sitter(AdS) algebra in a nondegenerate superspace.
Based on this algebra we construct a covariant kappa-symmetric superstring
action, and we examine its dynamics: Although this action reduces to the usual
Green-Schwarz superstring action in flat limit, the auxiliary fermionic
coordinates of the nondegenerate superspace becomes dynamical in the AdS
background.
