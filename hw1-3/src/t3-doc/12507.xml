<title>
On Bose-Fermi Statistics, Quantum Group Symmetry, and Second
  Quantization
</title>

<abstract>
  Can one represent quantum group covariant q-commuting ``creators,
annihilators'' $A^+_i,A^j$ as operators acting on standard bosonic/fermionic
Fock spaces? We briefly address this general problem and show that the answer
is positive (at least) in some simplest cases.
