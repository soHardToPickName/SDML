The Supercharges of Eleven-dimensional Supergraviton on Gravitational
  Wave Background
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the explicit expression of the supercharges of eleven dimensional
supergraviton on the background geometry of gravitational waves in
asymptotically light-like compactified spacetime. We perform the calculations
order by order in the fermions $\p$, while retaining all orders in bosonic
degrees of freedom, and get the closed form up to $\p^5$ order. This should
correspond to the supercharge of the effective action of (0+1)-dimensional
matrix quantum mechanics for, at least, $v^4$ and $v^6$ order terms and their
superpartners.
