<title>
Quadratic Poisson brackets compatible with an algebra structure
</title>

<abstract>
  Quadratic Poisson brackets on a vector space equipped with a bilinear
multiplication are studied. A notion of a bracket compatible with the
multiplication is introduced and an effective criterion of such compatibility
is given. Among compatible brackets, a subclass of coboundary brackets is
described, and such brackets are enumerated in a number of examples.
