Seiberg-Witten map and topology
</title>

<abstract>
  The mapping of topologically nontrivial gauge transformations in
noncommutative gauge theory to corresponding commutative ones is investigated
via the operator form of the Seiberg-Witten map. The role of the gauge
transformation part of the map is analyzed. Chern-Simons actions are examined
and the correspondence to their commutative counterparts is clarified.
