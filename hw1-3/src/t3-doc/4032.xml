<title>
Composite Vector and Tensor Gauge Fields, and Volume-Preserving
  Diffeomorphisms
</title>

<abstract>
  We describe new theories of composite vector and tensor (p-form) gauge fields
made out of zero-dimensional constituent scalar fields (``primitives''). The
local gauge symmetry is replaced by an infinite-dimensional global Noether
symmetry -- the group of volume-preserving (symplectic) diffeomorphisms of the
target space of the scalar primitives. We find additional non-Maxwell and
non-Kalb-Ramond solutions describing topologically massive tensor gauge field
configurations in odd space-time dimensions. Generalization to the
supersymmetric case is also sketched.
