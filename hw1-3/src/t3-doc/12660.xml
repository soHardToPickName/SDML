Projection Operators and D-branes in Purely Cubic Open String Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a matrix version of the purely cubic open string field theory as
describing the expansion around the closed string vacuum. Any D-branes in the
given closed string background can appear as classical solutions by using the
identity projectors. Expansion around this solution gives the correct kinetic
term for the open strings on the created D-branes while there are some
subtleties in the unwanted degree of freedom.
