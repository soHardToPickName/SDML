<title>
Consequence of Hawking radiation from 2d dilaton black holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate the CGHS model through numerical calculation. The behavior of
the mass function, which we introduced in our previous work as a ``local
mass'', is examined. We found that the mass function takes negative values,
which means that the amount of Hawking radiation becomes greater than the
initial mass of the black hole as in the case of the RST model.
