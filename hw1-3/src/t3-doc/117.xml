<title>
On evaluation of two-loop self-energy diagram with three propogator
</title>

<abstract>
  Small momentum expansion of the "sunset" diagram with three different masses
is obtained. Coefficients at powers of $p^2$ are evaluated explicitly in terms
of dilogarithms and elementary functions. Also some power expansions of
"sunset" diagram in terms of different sets of variables are given.
