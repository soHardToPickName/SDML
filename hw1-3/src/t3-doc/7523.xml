On the Canonical Treatment of Lagrangian Constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  The canonical treatment of dynamic systems with manifest Lagrangian
constraints proposed by Berezin is applied to concrete examples: a special
Lagrangian linear in velocities, relativistic particles in proper time gauge, a
relativistic string in orthonormal gauge, and the Maxwell field in the Lorentz
gauge,
