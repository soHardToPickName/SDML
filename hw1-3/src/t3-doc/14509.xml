Particle-Particle-String Vertex
</title>

<abstract>
  We study a theory of particles interacting with strings. Considering such a
theory for Type IIA superstring will give some clue about M-theory. As a first
step toward such a theory, we construct the particle-particle-string
interaction vertex generalizing the D-particle boundary state.
