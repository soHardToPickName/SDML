<title>
The Heat Kernel Expansion on a Cone and Quantum Fields Near Cosmic
  Strings
</title>

<abstract>
  An asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel on a cone where the
heat coefficients have a delta function behavior at the apex is obtained. It is
used to derive the renormalized effective action and total energy of a
self-interacting quantum scalar field on the cosmic string space-time. Analogy
is pointed out with quantum theory with boundaries. The surface infinities in
the effective action are shown to appear and are removed by renormalization of
the string tension. Besides, the total renormalized energy turns out to be
finite due to cancelation of the known non-integrable divergence in the energy
density of the field with a counterterm in the bare string tension.
