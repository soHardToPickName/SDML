<title>
Spacetime at the Planck scale and Path Integral
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a path integral formalism to introduce noncommutative
generalizations of spacetime manifold in even dimensions, which have been
suggested to be reasonable effective pictures at very small length scales, of
the order of Planck length.
