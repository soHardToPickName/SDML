AdS/CFT Correspondence and Supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We use the group-theoretic interpretation of the AdS/CFT correspondence which
we proposed earlier in order to lift intertwining operators acting between
boundary conformal representations to intertwining operators acting between
bulk conformal representations. Further, we present the classification of the
positive energy (lowest weight) unitary irreducible representations of the D=6
superconformal algebras $osp(8^*/2N)$.
