<title>
Quantization of Massive Non-Abelian Gauge Fields in The Hamiltonian Path
  Integral Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  It is argued that the massive non-Abelian gauge field theory without
involving Higgs bosons may be well established on the basis of gauge-invariance
principle because the dynamics of the field is gauge-invariant in the physical
space defined by the Lorentz constraint condition. The quantization of the
field can readily be performed in the Hamiltonian path-integral formalism and
leads to a quantum theory which shows good renormalizability and unitarity.
