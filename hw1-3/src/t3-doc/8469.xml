Reply to "Comment on One loop renormalization of soliton quantum mass
  corrections in (1+1)-dimensional scalar field theory models" (hep-th/0211149)
</title>

<abstract>
  I agree with the authors of hep-th/0211149 that the claim made in Phys.Lett.
B542, 282 (2002) is incorrect and that the derivation of its main formula,
although correct, contains two compensating errors. In this reply the main
formula of Phys.Lett. B542, 282 (2002) is rederived. This new derivation shows
that not only the energy momentum cut off regularization method still works in
the calculation of the soliton quantum mass corrections, but also that the so
called mode number regularization emerges naturally from it.
