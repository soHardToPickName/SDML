Generalized Q-Exponentials Related to Orthogonal Quantum Groups and
  Fourier Transformations of Noncommutative Spaces
</title>

<abstract>
  An essential prerequisite for the study of q-deformed physics are particle
states in position and momentum representation. In order to relate x- and
p-space by Fourier transformations the appropriate q-exponential series related
to orthogonal quantum symmetries is constructed. It turns out to be a new
q-special function giving rise to q-plane wave solutions that transform with a
noncommuting phase under translations.
