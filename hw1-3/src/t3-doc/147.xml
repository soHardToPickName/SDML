<title>
A Solution of the Maxwell-Dirac Equations in 3+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We investigate a class of localized, stationary, particular numerical
solutions to the Maxwell-Dirac system of classical nonlinear field equations.
The solutions are discrete energy eigenstates bound predominantly by the
self-produced electric field.
