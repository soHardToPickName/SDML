<title>
The Wilson Effective K\"ahler Potential For Supersymmetric Nonlinear
  Sigma Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Renormalization group methods are used to determine the evolution of the low
energy Wilson effective action for supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models in
four dimensions. For the case of supersymmetric $CP^{(N-1)}$ models, the
K\"ahler potential is determined exactly and is shown to exhibit a nontrivial
ultraviolet fixed point in addition to a trivial infrared fixed point. The
strong coupling behavior of the theory suggests the possible existence of
additional relevant operators or nonperturbative degrees of freedom.
