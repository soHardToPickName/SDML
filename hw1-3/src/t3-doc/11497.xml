<title>
The Dirac-Coulomb Problem for the $\kappa$-Poincare Quantum Group
</title>

<abstract>
  The recently introduced $\kappa$-Poincare-Dirac equation is gauged to treat
the $\kappa$-Dirac-Coulomb problem. For the resulting equation, we prove that
the perturbation to first order in the quantum group parameter vanishes
identically. The second order perturbation is singular, but assuming a
heuristic cut-off allows a qualitative estimate of the quantum group parameter.
