<title>
Noncommutative Geometric Gauge Theory from Superconnections
</title>

<abstract>
  Noncommutative geometric gauge theory is reconstructed based on the
superconnection concept. The bosonic action of the Connes-Lott model including
the symmetry breaking Higgs sector is obtained by using a new generalized
derivative, which consists of the usual 1-form exterior derivative plus an
extra element called the matrix derivative, for the curvatures. We first derive
the matrix derivative based on superconnections and then show how the matrix
derivative can give rise to spontaneous symmetry breaking. We comment on the
correspondence between the generalized derivative and the generalized Dirac
operator of the Connes-Lott model.
