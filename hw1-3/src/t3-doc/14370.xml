<title>
New Developments in the Continuous Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  Over the last several years, there has been a resurgence of interest in using
non-perturbative approximation methods based on Wilson's continuous
renormalization group. In this lecture, I review progress particularly in the
past year, concentrating on theoretical issues in the structure of the exact
renormalization group and its approximations.
