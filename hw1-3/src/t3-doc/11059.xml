Rank 48 gauge group in heterotic string
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the existence of a non-perturbative gauge sector that can raise
the rank of the gauge group of the N_4=2 heterotic string up to 48. These gauge
bosons, that don't exist in six dimensions, co-exist with those originating
from small instantons shrinking to zero size.
