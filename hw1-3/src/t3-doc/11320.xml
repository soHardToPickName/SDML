The energy-momentum tensor on noncommutative spaces - some pedagogical
  comments
</title>

<abstract>
  We present the discussion of the energy-momentum tensor of the scalar
$\phi^4$- theory on a noncommutative space. The Noether procedure is performed
at the operator level. Additionally, the broken dilatation symmetry will be
considered in a Moyal-Weyl deformed scalar field theory at the classical level.
