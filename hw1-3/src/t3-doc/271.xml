<title>
A Two Fluid Description of the Quantum Hall Soliton
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the Quantum Hall Soliton constructed in \cite{giantbob} is
stable under small perturbations. We find that creating quasiparticles actually
lowers the energy of the system, and discuss whether this indicates an
instability on the time scales relevant to the problem.
