<title>
The point-splitting regularization of (2+1)d parity breaking models
</title>

<abstract>
  The coefficient of the Chern-Simons term in the effective action for massive
Dirac fermions in three dimensions is computed by using the point-splitting
regularization method. We show that in this framework no ambiguities arise.
This is related to the fact that the point-splitting regularization does not
introduce additional parity breaking effects, implementing one possible
physical criterion in order to uniquely characterize the system.
