<title>
p-Brane Democracy
</title>

<abstract>
  The ten or eleven dimensional origin of central charges in the N=4 or N=8
supersymmetry algebra in four dimensions is reviewed: while some have a
standard Kaluza-Klein interpretation as momenta in compact dimensions, most
arise from $p$-form charges in the higher-dimensional supersymmetry algebra
that are carried by $p$-brane `solitons'. Although $p=1$ is singled out by
superstring perturbation theory, U-duality of N=8 superstring compactifications
implies a complete `$p$-brane democracy' of the full non-perturbative theory.
An `optimally democratic' perturbation theory is defined to be one in which the
perturbative spectrum includes all particles with zero magnetic charge. Whereas
the heterotic string is optimally democratic in this sense, the type II
superstrings are not, although the 11-dimensional supermembrane might be.
