N=1 Supersymmetric $SU(2)^r$ Moose Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the quantum moduli spaces and dynamical superpotentials of four
dimensional $SU(2)^r$ linear and ring moose theories with $\mathcal{N}=1$
supersymmetry and link chiral superfields in the fundamental representation.
Nontrivial quantum moduli spaces and dynamical superpotentials are produced.
When the moduli space is perturbed by generic tree level superpotentials, the
vacuum space becomes discrete. The ring moose is in the Coulomb phase and we
find two singular submanifolds with a nontrivial modulus that is a function of
all the independent gauge invariants needed to parameterize the quantum moduli
space. The massive theory near these singularities confines. The Seiberg-Witten
elliptic curve that describes the quantum moduli space of the ring moose is
produced.
