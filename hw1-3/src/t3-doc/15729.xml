<title>
Evolution of the Bogoluibov Renormalization Group
</title>

<abstract>
  We start with a simple introduction into the renormalization group (RG) in
quantum field theory and give an overview of the renormalization group method.
The third section is devoted to essential topics of the renorm-group use in the
QFT. Here, some fresh results are included.
  Then we turn to the remarkable proliferation of the RG ideas into various
fields of physics. The last section summarizes an impressive recent progress of
the "QFT renormalization group" application in mathematical physics.
