<title>
The universal R-matrix and its associated quantum algebra as functionals
  of the classical r-matrix: the $sl_{2}$ case
</title>

<abstract>
  Using a geometrical approach to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, the quantum
algebra ${\cal U}_{\hbar}(sl_{2})$ and its universal quantum $R$-matrix are
explicitely constructed as functionals of the associated classical $r$-matrix.
In this framework, the quantum algebra ${\cal U}_{\hbar}(sl_{2})$ is naturally
imbedded in the universal envelopping algebra of the $sl_{2}$ current algebra.
