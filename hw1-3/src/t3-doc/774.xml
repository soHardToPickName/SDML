<title>
Determinant and Character of W-infinity algebra
</title>

<abstract>
  We diagonalize the Hilbert space of some subclass of the quasifinite module
of the \Winf algebra. States are classified according to their eigenvalues for
infinitely many commuting charges and the Young diagrams. The parameter
dependence of their norms is explicitly derived. The full character formulae of
the degenerate representations are given as summation of the bilinear
combinations of the Schur polynomials.
