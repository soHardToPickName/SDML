<title>
Analysis of All Dimensionful Parameters Relevant in Gravitational
  Dressing of Conformal Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from a covariant and background independent definition of normal
ordered vertex operators we give an alternative derivation of the KPZ relation
between conformal dimensions and their gravitational dressed partners. With our
method we are able to study for arbitrary genus the dependence of N-point
functions on all dimensionful parameters. Implications for the interpretation
of gravitational dressed dimensions are discussed.
