Berry's Connection and USp(2k) Matrix Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Berry's connection is computed in the USp(2k) matrix model. In T dualized
quantum mechanics, the Berry phase exhibits a residual interaction taking place
at a distance m_(f) from the orientifold surface via the integration of the
fermions in the fundamental representation. This is interpreted as a coupling
of the magnetic D2 with the electric D4 branes. We make a comment on the Berry
phase associated with the 6D nonabelian gauge anomaly whose cancellation
selects the number of flavours n_f=16.
