<title>
Generalized Heisenberg Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the XXZ model for a chain of particles whose spins are arbitrary
with the anisotropy parameter equal to the root of minus one and generalized
periodic boundary conditions. The conditions for the truncation of the
functional fusion relations of the transfer matrices are obtained. The
truncation results in a closed system of equations whose solution allows
obtaining the energy spectrum.
