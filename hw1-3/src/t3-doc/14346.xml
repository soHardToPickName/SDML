<title>
Supersymmetry and localization
</title>

<abstract>
  We study conditions under which an odd symmetry of the integrand leads to
localization of the corresponding integral over a (super)manifold. We also show
that in many cases these conditions guarantee exactness of the stationary phase
approximation of such integrals.
