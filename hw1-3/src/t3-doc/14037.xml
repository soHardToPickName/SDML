<title>
Color-Coulomb Force Calculated from Lattice Coulomb Hamiltonian
</title>

<abstract>
  The static color-Coulomb potential is calculated as the solution of a
non-linear integral equation. This equation has been derived recently as a
self-consistency condition which arises in the Coulomb Hamiltonian formulation
of lattice gauge theory when the restriction to the interior of the Gribov
horizon is implemented. The potential obtained is in qualitative agreement with
expectations, being Coulombic with logarithmic corrections at short range and
confining at long range. The values obtained for the string tension and
$\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}$ are in semi-quantitative agreement with lattice Monte
Carlo and phenomenological determinations.
