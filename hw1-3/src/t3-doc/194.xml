<title>
Class of self-dual models in three dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  In the present paper we introduce a hierarquical class of self-dual models in
three dimensions, inspired in the original self-dual theory of
Towsend-Pilch-Nieuwenhuizen. The basic strategy is to explore the powerful
property of the duality transformations in order to generate a new field. The
generalized propagator can be written in terms of the primitive one (first
order), and also the respective order and disorder correlation functions. Some
conclusions about the ``charge screening'' and magnetic flux were established.
