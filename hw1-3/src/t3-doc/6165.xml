Rarita-Schwinger Field in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  A free Rarita-Schwinger field in the Anti-de Sitter space is considered. We
show that the usual action can be supplemented by a boundary term that can be
interpreted as the generating functional of the correlation functions in a
conformal field theory on the boundary of the Anti-de Sitter space.
