Low Energy Description of Fermion Pairs in Topologically Massive
  QED$_{2+1}$ with $N$ Flavours
</title>

<abstract>
  In topologically massive QED$_{2+1}$ with $N$ flavours, there is the
possibility that two equal-charged fermions can form a bound state pair in
either s-wave or p-wave. We are concerned about the s-wave pairs and obtain the
low energy effective action describing them. It is shown that the fermion pairs
behave like doubly charged spin-1 bosons and, when they condense, the gauge
field aquires the longitudinal mass. The approximate $SU(2)$ symmetry due to
the similarity between the fermion pairs and the gauge field is discussed.
