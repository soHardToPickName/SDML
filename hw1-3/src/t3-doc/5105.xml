Nonvacuum pseudoparticles, quantum tunneling and metastability
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that nonvacuum pseudoparticles can account for quantum tunneling
and metastability. In particular the saddle-point nature of the pseudoparticles
is demonstrated, and the evaluation of path-integrals in their neighbourhood.
Finally the relation between instantons and bounces is used to derive a result
conjectured by Bogomolny and Fateyev.
