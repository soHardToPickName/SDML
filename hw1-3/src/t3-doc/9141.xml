<title>
Calogero-Vasiliev Oscillator in Dynamically Evolving Curved Spacetime
</title>

<abstract>
In a recent work, the consequences of quantizing a real scalar field $\Phi$
according to generalized ``quon'' statistics in a dynamically evolving curved
spacetime (~which, prior to some initial time and subsequent to some later
time, is flat~) were considered. Here a similar calculation is performed; this
time we quantize $\Phi$ via the Calogero-Vasiliev oscillator algebra, described
by a real parameter $\nu > -1/2$. It is found that both conservation ( $\nu
\rightarrow \nu$ ) and anticonservation ( $\nu \rightarrow - \nu$ ) of
statistics is allowed. We find that for mathematical consistency the Bogoliubov
coefficients associated with the $i$'th field mode must satisfy $|\alpha_i |^2
- | \beta_i |^2 = 1$ with $| \beta_i |^2$ taking an integer value.
