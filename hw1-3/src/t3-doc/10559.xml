<title>
Bose-Einstein condensation of scalar fields on hyperbolic manifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  The problem of Bose-Einstein condensation for a relativistic ideal gas on a
3+1 dimensional manifold with a hyperbolic spatial part is analyzed in some
detail. The critical temperature is evaluated and its dependence of curvature
is pointed out.
