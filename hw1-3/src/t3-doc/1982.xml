<title>
The Central Correlations of Hypercharge, Isospin, Colour and Chirality
  in the Standard Model
</title>

<abstract>
  The correlation of the fractionally represented hypercharge group with the
isospin and colour group in the standard model determines as faithfully
represented internal group the quotient group
${\U(1)\x\SU(2)\x\SU(3)\over\Z_2\x\Z_3}$. The discrete cyclic central
abelian-nonabelian internal correlation involved is considered with respect to
its consequences for the representations by the standard model fields, the
electroweak mixing angle and the symmetry breakdown. There exists a further
discrete $\Z_2$-correlation between chirality and Lorentz properties and also a
continuous $\U(1)$-external-internal one between hyperisospin and chirality.
