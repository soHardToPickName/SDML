<title>
A Field Theory Approach to the $t$-$J$ Model and the Spin-Charge
  Separation
</title>

<abstract>
  We analyze the $t$-$J$ model using the ${\rm CP}^1$ representation for the
slave operators (holons and spinons) which is particularly suited to study the
phenomenon of the spin-charge separation in strongly correlated electron
systems. In particular, we show that for the one-dimensional $t$-$J$ model
below half-filling the low energy effective dynamics of the spin and charge
degrees of freedom is represented in the continuum limit by a ${\rm CP}^1$
model with a topological term, minimally coupled to a massless Dirac field with
a four-fermion interaction. The bosonic term of this action describes the spin
waves produced by the spinons, while the fermionic term represents the low
energy charge excitations. This theory exhibits explicitly a local abelian
gauge invariance.
