Another Alternative to Compactification: Noncommutative Geometry and
  Randall-Sundrum Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We observe that the main feature of the Randall-Sundrum model, used to solve
the hierarchy problem, is already present in a class of Yang-Mills plus gravity
theories inspired by noncommutative geometry. Strikingly the same expression
for the Higgs potential is found in two models which have no apparent
connection. Some speculations concerning the possible relationships are given.
