<title>
Conformal Models of Two-Dimensional Turbulence
</title>

<abstract>
  Polyakov recently showed how to use conformal field theory to describe
two-dimensional turbulence. Here we construct an infinite hierarchy of
solutions, both for the constant enstrophy flux cascade, and the constant
energy flux cascade. We conclude with some speculations concerning the
stability and physical meaning of these solutions.
