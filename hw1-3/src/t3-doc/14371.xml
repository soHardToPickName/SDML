Superconformal Field Theory with Boundary: Fermionic Model
</title>

<abstract>
  Fermionic model of Superconformal field theory with boundary is considered.
There were written the ''boundary'' Ward Identity for this theory and also
constructed boundary states for fermionic and spin models. For this model were
derived ''bootstrap'' equations for boundary structure constants.
