<title>
The Lorentz-Dirac Equation and the Physical Meaning of the Maxwell's
  Fields
</title>

<abstract>
  Classical Electrodynamics is not a consistent theory because of its field
inadequate behaviour in the vicinity of their sources. Its problems with the
electron equation of motion and with non-integrable singularity of the electron
self field and of its stress tensor are well known. These inconsistencies are
eliminated if the discrete and localized (classical photons) character of the
electromagnetic interaction is anticipatively recognized already in a classical
context. This is possible, in a manifestly covariant way, with a new model of
spacetime structure, shown in a previous paper $^{1}$, that invalidates the
Lorentz-Dirac equation. For a point classical electron there is no field
singularity, no causality violation and no conflict with energy conservation in
the electron equation of motion. The electromagnetic field must be
re-interpreted in terms of average flux of classical photons. Implications of a
singularity-free formalism to field theory are discussed.
