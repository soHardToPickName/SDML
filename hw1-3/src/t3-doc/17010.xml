More about the S=1 relativistic oscillator
</title>

<abstract>
  Following to the lines drawn in my previous paper about the S=0 relativistic
oscillator I build up an oscillatorlike system which can be named as the S=1
Proca oscillator. The Proca field function is obtained in the framework of the
Bargmann-Wigner prescription and the interaction is introduced similarly to the
S=1/2 Dirac oscillator case regarded by Moshinsky and Szczepaniak. We obtained
the intriguing rule of quantization: E = \hbar \omega /2 for the parity states
(-1)^j and E = \pm \hbar \omega (j+1/2) for the parity states -(-1)^j. There
are no radial excitations. Finally, I apply the above-mentioned procedure to
the case of the two-body relativistic oscillator.
