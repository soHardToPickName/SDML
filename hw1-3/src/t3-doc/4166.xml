Perturbative Anomalies of the M-5-brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss several mechanisms to cancel the anomalies of a 5-brane embedded
in M-theory. Two of them work, provided we impose suitable conditions either on
the 11-dimensional manifold of M-theory or on the 4-form field strength of
M-theory.
