Supermembranes and Supermatrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We briefly review recent developments in the theory of supermembranes and
supermatrix models. In a second part we discuss their interaction with
background fields. In particular, we present the full background field coupling
for the bosonic case. This is a short summary of the talk at the workshop. A
more extended version will appear elsewhere.
