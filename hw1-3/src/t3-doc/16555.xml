Why two makes it more attractive than just with one... or Bianchi
  class-A models and Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes in Quantum N=2
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Bianchi class-A models and Reissner-Nordst\"rom (RN) black hole scenarios are
considered from the point of view of quantum N=2 Supergravity. It is shown that
the presence of Maxwell fields in the supersymmetry constraints implies a
non-conservation of the fermion number present in Bianchi class-A models. This
effect corresponds to a mixing between different (Lorentz invariant) fermionic
sectors in the wave function of the Universe. Quantum states are constituted by
exponentials of N=2 supersymmetric Chern-Simons functionals. With respect to
the RN case, we analyse some problems and features present in a reduced model
with supersymmetry. 
  Lines of subsequent research work are then provided.
