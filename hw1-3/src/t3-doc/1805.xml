Gravitational Meissner Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  The gravitational analogue of the electromagnetic Meissner effect is
investigated. Starting from the post-Newtonian approximation to general
relativity we arrive at gravitational London equations, predicting a
gravitational Meissner effect. Applied to neutron stars we arrive at a London
penetration depth of 12km, which is about the size of a neutron star.
