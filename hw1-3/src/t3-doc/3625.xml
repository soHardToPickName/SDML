<title>
Exact low-energy effective actions for hypermultiplets in four
  dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the general hypermultiplet Low-Energy Effective Action (LEEA)
that may appear in quantized, four-dimensional, N=2 supersymmetric, gauge
theories, e.g. in the Coulomb and Higgs branches. Our main purpose is a
description of the exact LEEA of n magnetically charged hypermultiplets. The
hypermultiplet LEEA is given by the N=2 supersymmetric Non-Linear Sigma-Model
(NLSM) with a 4n-dimensional hyper-K"ahler metric, subject to non-anomalous
symmetries. Harmonic Superspace (HSS) and the NLSM isometries are very useful
to constrain the hyper-K"ahler geometry of the LEEA. We use N=2 supersymmetric
projections of HSS superfields to N=2 linear (tensor) O(2) and O(4) multiplets
in N=2 Projective Superspace (PSS) to deduce the explicit form of the LEEA in
some particular cases. As the by-product, a simple new classification of all
multi-monopole moduli space metrics having su(2)_R symmetry is proposed in
terms of real quartic polynomials of 2n variables, modulo Sp(n)
transformations. The 4d hypermultiplet LEEA for n=2 can be encoded in terms of
an elliptic curve.
