<title>
Perturbation theory in the invariant subspace
</title>

<abstract>
  The unitary transformation of path-integral differential measure is
described. The main properties of perturbation theory in the phase space of
action-angle, energy-time variables are investigated. The measure in
cylindrical coordinates is derived also. The dependence of perturbation theory
contributions from global (topological) properties of corresponding phase
spaces is shown.
