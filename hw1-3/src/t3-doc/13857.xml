Absorption of dilaton s-wave in type 0B string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the absorption probability of dilaton field in type 0B string theory.
Since the background solutions are of the form $AdS_5 \times S^5$ on both
regions, we use the semiclassical formalism adopted in type IIB theory to find
the absorption cross section. The background tachyon field solution was used as
a reference to relate the solutions of the two regions. We also consider the
possible corrections to absorption probability and the $\ln(\ln z)$ form of the
correction is expected as in the calculation of the confinement solution.
