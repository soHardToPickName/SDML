An Index Theorem for Domain Walls in Supersymmetric Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The supersymmetric abelian Higgs model with N scalar fields admits multiple
domain wall solutions. We perform a Callias-type index calculation to determine
the number of zero modes of this soliton. We confirm that the most general
domain wall has 2(N-1) zero modes, which can be interpreted as the positions
and phases of (N-1) constituent domain walls. This implies the existence of
moduli for a D-string interpolating between N D5-branes in IIB string theory.
