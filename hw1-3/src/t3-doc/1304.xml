Analytic continuations of de Sitter thick domain wall solutions
</title>

<abstract>
  We perform some analytic continuations of the de Sitter thick domain wall
solutions obtained in our previous paper hep-th/0201130 in the system of
gravity and a scalar field with an axion-like potential. The obtained new
solutions represent anti-de Sitter thick domain walls and cosmology. The
anti-de Sitter domain wall solutions are periodic, and correspondingly the
cosmological solutions represent cyclic universes. We parameterize the
axion-like scalar field potential and determine the parameter regions of each
type of solutions.
