<title>
N=1 Supersymmetric Theory of Higher Spin Gauge Fields in AdS(5) at the
  Cubic Level
</title>

<abstract>
  We formulate gauge invariant interactions of totally symmetric tensor and
tensor-spinor higher spin gauge fields in AdS(5) that properly account for
higher-spin-gravitational interactions at the action level in the first
nontrivial order.
