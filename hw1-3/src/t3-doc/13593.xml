<title>
Asymmetric Orbifolds and Grand Unification
</title>

<abstract>
  We generalize the rules for the free fermionic string construction to include
other asymmetric orbifolds with world-sheet bosons. We use these rules to
construct various grand unified string models that involve level-3 current
algebras. We present the explicit construction of three classes of
3-chiral-family grand unified models in the heterotic string theory. Each model
has 5 left-handed, and two right-handed families, and an adjoint Higgs. Two of
them are SO(10) and the third is E_6. With Wilson lines and/or varying moduli,
we show how other 3-family grand unified models, such as SO(10) and SU(5), may
be constructed from them.
