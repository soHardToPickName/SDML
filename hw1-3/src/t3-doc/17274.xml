<title>
An algebraic approach to coarse graining
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose that Kreimer's method of Feynman diagram renormalization via a
Hopf algebra of rooted trees can be fruitfully employed in the analysis of
block spin renormalization or coarse graining of inhomogeneous statistical
systems. Examples of such systems include spin foam formulations of
non-perturbative quantum gravity as well as lattice gauge and spin systems on
irregular lattices and/or with spatially varying couplings. We study three
examples which are Z_2 lattice gauge theory on irregular 2-dimensional
lattices, Ising/Potts models with varying bond strengths and (1+1)-dimensional
spin foam models.
