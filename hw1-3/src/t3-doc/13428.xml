Moduli Stabilization for Intersecting Brane Worlds in Type 0' String
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  Starting from the non-supersymmetric, tachyon-free orientifold of type 0
string theory, we construct four-dimensional brane world models with D6-branes
intersecting at angles on internal tori. They support phenomenologically
interesting gauge theories with chiral fermions. Despite the theory being
non-supersymmetric the perturbative scalar potential induced at leading order
is shown to stabilize geometric moduli, leaving only the dilaton tadpole
uncanceled. As an example we present a three generation model with gauge group
and fermion spectrum close to a left-right symmetric extension of the Standard
Model.
