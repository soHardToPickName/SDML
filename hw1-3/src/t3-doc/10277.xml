IIB or not IIB
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider Type IIB superstring theory with the addition of n 9-branes and n
anti-9-branes (and no orientifolds). The result is a ten-dimensional chiral
theory of open and closed oriented strings with gauge group U(n) \times U(n).
There is, however, a tachyonic instability which can be understood as the
consequence of brane-antibrane annihilation. We therefore expect to recover the
usual IIB theory as the tachyon rolls to infinity.
