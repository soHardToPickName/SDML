On the Uniqueness of Black Hole Attractors
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the attractor mechanism for extremal black holes in the context of
five dimensional N = 2 supergravity and show that attractor points are unique
in the extended vector multiplet moduli space. Implications for black hole
entropy are discussed.
