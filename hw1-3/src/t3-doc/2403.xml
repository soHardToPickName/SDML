<title>
Double Scaling Limit in Random Matrix Models and a Nonlinear Hierarchy
  of Differential Equations
</title>

<abstract>
  We derive the double scaling limit of eigenvalue correlations in the random
matrix model at critical points and we relate the limiting correlation
functions to a nonlinear hierarchy of ordinary differential equations.
