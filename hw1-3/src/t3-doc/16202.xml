Effective Average Action in N=1 Super-Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  For N=1 Super-Yang-Mills theory we generalize the effective average action
Gamma_k in a manifest supersymmetric way using the superspace formalism. The
exact evolution equation for Gamma_k is derived and, introducing as an
application a simple truncation, the standard one-loop beta-function of N=1 SYM
theory is obtained.
