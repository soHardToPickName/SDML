<title>
K"ahler Potential for Global Symmetry Breaking in Supersymmetric
  Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We have developed N=1 supersymmetric nonlinear realization methods, which
realize global symmetry breaking in N=1 supersymmetric theories. The target
space of nonlinear sigma models with a linear model origin is a G^C-orbit,
which is a non-compact non-homogeneous K"ahler manifold. We show that, if and
only if the orbit is open, it includes a compact homogeneous K"ahler manifold
as a submanifold, and a class of strictly G-invariant K"ahler potentials
reduces to a K"ahler potential G-invariant up to a K"ahler transformation on
the submanifold. Hence, in the case of an open orbit, the most general
low-energy effective K"ahler potential can be written as the sum of those of
the compact submanifolds and an arbitrary function of strictly G-invariants.
