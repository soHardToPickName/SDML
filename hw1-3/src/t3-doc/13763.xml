Exact Noncommutative Solitons
</title>

<abstract>
  We find exact solitons in a large class of noncommutative gauge theories
using a simple solution generating technique. The solitons in the effective
field theory description of open string field theory are interpreted as
D-branes for any value of the noncommutativity. We discuss the vacuum structure
of open string field theory in view of our results.
