String Theory and the Principle of Black Hole Complementarity
</title>

<abstract>
  String theory provides an example of the kind of apparent inconsistency that
the {\it Principle of Black Hole Complementarity\/} deals with. To a freely
infalling observer a string falling through a black hole horizon appears to be
a Planck size object. To an outside observer the string and all the information
it carries begin to spread as the string approaches the horizon. In a time of
order the ``information retention time'' it fills the entire area of the
horizon.
