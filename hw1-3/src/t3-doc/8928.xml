<title>
Duality in N=1 Supersymmetric gauge theories and recent developments
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss a number of exact results in N=1 supersymmetric field theories. We
review the results obtained by Seiberg in Super-Yang-Mills (SYM) theories with
matter in fundamental representation. We then consider Kutasov-type SYM
theories, which also contain matter in the adjoint representation and an
appropriate tree--level superpotential. We finally focus on one particular case
in the latter theories, a generalization of the theories with equal number of
flavors and colors studied by Seiberg, in which non--trivial superconformal
theories appear at certain sections of the quantum--modified moduli space.
Throughout the paper we stress the role played by duality in the search for
exact results.
