Hungry Volterra equation, multi boson KP hierarchy and Two Matrix Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the hungry Volterra hierarchy from the view point of the multi
boson KP hierarchy. We construct the hungry Volterra equation as the
B\"{a}cklund transformations (BT) which are not the ordinary ones. We call them
``fractional '' BT. We also study the relations between the (discrete time)
hungry Volterra equation and two matrix models. From this point of view we
study the reduction from (discrete time) 2d Toda lattice to the (discrete time)
hungry Volterra equation.
