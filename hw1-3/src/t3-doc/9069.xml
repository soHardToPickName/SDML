<title>
The Wilson Renormalization Group Approach of the Principal Chiral Model
  around Two Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the Principal Chiral Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson model around two
dimensions within the Local Potential Approximation of an Exact Renormalization
Group equation. This model, relevant for the long distance physics of classical
frustrated spin systems, exhibits a fixed point of the same universality class
that the corresponding Non-Linear Sigma model. This allows to shed light on the
long-standing discrepancy between the different perturbative approaches of
frustrated spin systems.
