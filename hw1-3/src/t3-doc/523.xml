Yang-Mills and Supersymmetry Covariance Must Coexist
</title>

<abstract>
  Supersymmetry and Yang-Mills type gauge invariance are two of the essential
properties of most, and possibly the most important models in fundamental
physics. Supersymmetry is nearly trivial to prove in the (traditionally
gauge-noncovariant) superfield formalism, whereas the gauge-covariant formalism
makes gauge invariance manifest. In 3+1-dimensions, the transformation from one
into the other is elementary and essentially unique. By contrast, this
transformation turns out to be impossible in the most general 1+1-dimensional
case. In fact, only the (manifestly) gauge- and supersymmetry-covariant
formalism guarantees both universal gauge-invariance and supersymmetry.
