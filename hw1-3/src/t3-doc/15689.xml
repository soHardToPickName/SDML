<title>
Massive IIA String Theory and Matrix Theory Compactification
</title>

<abstract>
  We propose a Matrix Theory approach to Romans' massive Type IIA supergravity.
It is obtained by applying the procedure of Matrix Theory compactifications to
Hull's proposal of the Massive Type IIA String Theory as M-Theory on a twisted
torus. The resulting Matrix Theory is a super-Yang Mills theory on large N
three-branes with a space dependent non-commutativity parameter, which is also
independently derived by a T-duality approach. We give evidence showing that
the energies of a class of physical excitations of the super-Yang Mills theory
show the correct symmetry expected from Massive Type IIA string theory in a
lightcone quantization.
