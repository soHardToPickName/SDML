Thermodynamics of D0-branes in matrix theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We examine the matrix theory representation of D0-brane dynamics at finite
temperature. In this case, violation of supersymmetry by temperature leads to a
non-trivial static potential between D0-branes at any finite temperature. We
compute the static potential in the 1-loop approximation and show that it is
short-ranged and attractive. We compare the result with the computations in
superstring theory. We show that thermal states of D0-branes can be reproduced
by matrix theory only when certain care is taken in integration over the moduli
space of classical solutions in compactified time.
