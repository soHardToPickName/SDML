Instanton Induced Large $N$ Phase Transitions in Two and Four
  Dimensional QCD
</title>

<abstract>
  The $1/N$ expansion of the weak coupling phase of two-dimensional QCD on a
sphere is constructed. It is demonstrated that the phase transition from the
weak to the strong coupling phase is induced by instantons. A double scaling
limit of the theory at the point of the phase transition is constructed, the
value of string susceptibility is determined to be $\gamma_{str}=-1$. The
possibility of instanton induced large $N$ phase transitions in four
dimensional QCD is explored.
