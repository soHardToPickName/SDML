Quantum corrections for (anti)-evaporating black hole
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we analyse the quantum correction for Schwarzschild black hole
in the Unruh state in the framework of spherically symmetric gravity (SSG)
model. SSG is a two-dimensional dilaton model which is obtained by spherically
symmetric reduction from the four-dimensional theory. We find the one-loop
geometry of the (anti)-evaporating black hole and corrections for mass, entropy
and apparent horizon.
