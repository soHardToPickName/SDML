On Orientifold Constructions of Type IIA Dual Pairs
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we analyze the earlier constructions of the type IIA dual pairs
through orientifolding. By an appropriate choice of $\Gamma$-matrix basis for
the spinor representations of the $U$-duality group, we give an explicit
relationship between the orientifold models and their dual pairs.
