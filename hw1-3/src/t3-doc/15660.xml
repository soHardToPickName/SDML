<title>
Black Hole Thermodynamics from String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In this note we consider a stringy description of black hole horizon. We
start with a nonlinear sigma model defined on a two dimensional Euclidean
surface with background Rindler metric. By solving the field equations, we show
that to the leading order the Bekenstein-Hawking formula of black hole entropy
can be produced. We also point out a relation between the present formalism and
the 'tHooft formalism.
