<title>
Monopoles and Black Hole Entropy
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the entropy of a black hole which has zero area horizon. The
microstates appear as monopole solutions of the effective theory on the
corresponding brane configurations.The resulting entropy formula coincides with
the one expected from stringy calculation and agrees with U-duality invariance
of entropy.
