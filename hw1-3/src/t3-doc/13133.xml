<title>
Non-Yang-Mills Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  Various gauge invariant but non-Yang-Mills dynamical models are discussed:
Pr\'ecis of Chern-Simons theory in (2+1)-dimensions and reduction to
(1+1)-dimensional B-F theories; gauge theories for (1+1)-dimensional
gravity-matter interactions; parity and gauge invariant mass term in
(2+1)-dimensions.
