Aspects of Heterotic/M-Theory Duality in D=3
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the duality between M-theory compactified on Calabi-Yau fourfolds
and the heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau threefolds times a circle.
Our analysis is based on a comparison of the low energy effective actions in
three dimensions.
