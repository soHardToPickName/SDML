<title>
On the quantization of SU(3)-skyrmions
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantization condition derived previously for SU(2) solitons quantized
with SU(3)-collective coordinates is generalized for SU(3) skyrmions with
strangeness content different from zero. Quantization of the dipole-type
configuration with large strangeness content found recently is considered as an
example.
