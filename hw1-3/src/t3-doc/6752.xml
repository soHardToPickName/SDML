<title>
Modal expansions and non-perturbative quantum field theory in Minkowski
  space
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a spectral approach to non-perturbative field theory within the
periodic field formalism. As an example we calculate the real and imaginary
parts of the propagator in 1+1 dimensional phi^4 theory, identifying both
one-particle and multi-particle contributions. We discuss the computational
limits of existing diagonalization algorithms and suggest new quasi-sparse
eigenvector methods to handle very large Fock spaces and higher dimensional
field theories.
