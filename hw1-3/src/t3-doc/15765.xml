<title>
A theorem on the real part of the high-energy scattering amplitude near
  the forward direction
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that if for fixed negative (physical) square of the momentum transfer
t, the differential cross-section ${d\sigma\over dt}$ tends to zero and if the
total cross-section tends to infinity, when the energy goes to infinity, the
real part of the even signature amplitude cannot have a constant sign near t =
0.
