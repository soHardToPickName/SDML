<title>
Five Dimensional U-Duality, Black-Hole Entropy and Topological
  Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the topological entropy formula for all $N>2$ extended supergravities
in five dimensions and the fixed scalar condition for the black-hole
``potential energy'' which extremizes the BPS mass. We comment upon the
interpretation of these results in a string and M-theory setting.
