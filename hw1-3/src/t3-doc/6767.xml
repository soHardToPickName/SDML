<title>
The Barnes zeta-function, sphere determinants and Glaisher-
  Kinkelin-Bendersky constants
</title>

<abstract>
  Summations and relations involving the Hurwitz and Riemann zeta-functions are
extended first to Barnes zeta-functions and then to zeta-functions of general
type. The analysis is motivated by the evaluation of determinants on spheres
which are treated both by a direct expansion method and by regularised sums.
Comments on existing calculations are made. A Kaluza--Klein technique is
introduced providing a determinant interpretation of the
Glaisher-Kinkelin-Bendersky constants which are then generalised to arbitrary
zeta-functions. This technique allows an improved treatment of sphere
determinants.
