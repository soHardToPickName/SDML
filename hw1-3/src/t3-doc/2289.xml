<title>
(Non-)Anomalous D-brane and O-plane couplings: the normal bundle
</title>

<abstract>
  The direct string computation of anomalous D-brane and orientifold plane
couplings is extended to include the curvature of the normal bundle. The
normalization of these terms is fixed unambiguously. New, non-anomalous
gravitational couplings are found.
