<title>
Calabi-Yau Compactification of Type-IIB string and a Mass Formula of the
  Extreme Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  Recently proposed mechanism of the black hole condensation at conifold
singularity in type II string is an interesting idea from which we can
interpret the phase of the universal moduli space of the string vacua. It might
also be expected that the true physics is on the conifold singularity after
supersymmetry breaking. We derive a mass formula for the extreme black holes
caused by the self-dual 5-form field strength, which is stable and
supersymmetric. It is shown that the formula can be written by the moduli
parameters of Calabi-Yau manifold and can be calculated explicitly.
