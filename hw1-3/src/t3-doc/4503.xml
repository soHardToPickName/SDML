Classically integrable boundary conditions for affine Toda field
  theories
</title>

<abstract>
Boundary conditions compatible with classical integrability are studied both
directly, using an approach based on the explicit construction of conserved
quantities, and indirectly by first developing a generalisation of the Lax pair
idea. The latter approach is closer to the spirit of earlier work by Sklyanin
and yields a complete set of conjectures for permissible boundary conditions
for any affine Toda field theory.
