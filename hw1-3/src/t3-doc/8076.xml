Higher Order Graviton Scattering in M(atrix) Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  In matrix theory the effective action for graviton-graviton scattering is a
double expansion in the relative velocity and inverse separation. We discuss
the systematics of this expansion and subject matrix theory to a new test. Low
energy supergravity predicts the coefficient of the $v^6/r^{14}$ term, a
two-loop effect, in agreement with explicit matrix model calculation.
