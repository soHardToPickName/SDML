<title>
Homology in Abelian Lattice Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We study abelian lattice gauge theory defined on a simplicial complex with
arbitrary topology. The use of dual objects allows one to reformulate the
theory in terms of new dynamical variables; however, we avoid the use of the
dual lattice entirely. Topological modes which are present in the
transformation now appear as homology classes, in contrast to the cohomology
modes found in the dual cell picture. Irregularities of dual cell complexes do
not arise in this approach. We treat the two and three dimensional cases in
detail.
