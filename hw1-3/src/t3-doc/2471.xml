Hard Thermal Loops in a Moving Plasma and a Magnetic Mass Term
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the hard thermal loops of QCD for a moving quark-gluon plasma.
Generalizing from this we suggest a candidate for the magnetic mass term. This
term may also be useful in understanding the mass gap of three-dimensional
non-Abelian gauge theories.
