<title>
The Intrinsic Coupling in Integrable Quantum Field Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The intrinsic 4-point coupling, defined in terms of a truncated 4-point
function at zero momentum, provides a well-established measure for the
interaction strength of a QFT. We show that this coupling can be computed
non-perturbatively and to high accuracy from the form factors of an
(integrable) QFT. The technique is illustrated and tested with the Ising model,
the XY-model and the O(3) nonlinear sigma-model. The results are compared to
those from high precision lattice simulations.
