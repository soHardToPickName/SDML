Supercurrents on Asymmetric Orbifolds
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $E_8 \times E_8$-heterotic string on asymmetric orbifolds associated
with semi-simple simply-laced Lie algebras. Using the fact that $E_6$-model
allows different twists, we present a new N=1 space-time supersymmetric model
whose supercurrent appears from twisted sectors but not untwisted sector.
