A Derivation of the Cyclic Form Factor Equation
</title>

<abstract>
  A derivation of the cyclic form factor equation from quantum field
theoretical principles is given; form factors being the matrix elements of a
field operator between scattering states. The scattering states are constructed
from Haag-Ruelle type interpolating fields with support in a `comoving' Rindler
spacetime. The cyclic form factor equation then arises from the KMS property of
the modular operators Delta associated with the field algebras of these Rindler
wedges. The derivation in particular shows that the equation holds in any
massive 1+1 dim. relativistic QFT, regardless of its integrability.
