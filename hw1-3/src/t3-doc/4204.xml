Controlled Soft Breaking of N=1 SQCD
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the introduction of soft breaking terms into the exact solutions
of N=1 SQCD using a spurion analysis. The spurion symmetries are not sufficient
to determine the behavior of models in which squark or gaugino masses alone are
introduced. However, a controlled approximation is obtained in some cases if a
supersymmetric mass is first introduced for the matter fields. We present
low-energy solutions for two models with perturbing soft breaking terms, one
with a gaugino mass and one with squark mixing. These models have non-trivial
theta angle dependence and exhibit phase transitions at non-zero theta angle
analogous to those found in the chiral Lagrangian description of QCD.
