Complete factorization of equations of motion in Wess-Zumino theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove that the equations of motion describing domain walls in a
Wess-Zumino theory involving only one chiral matter multiplet can be factorized
into first order Bogomol'nyi equations, so that all the topological defects are
of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield type.
