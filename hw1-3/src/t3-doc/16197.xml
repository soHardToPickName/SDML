Hopf instantons, Chern-Simons vortices, and Heisenberg ferromagnets
</title>

<abstract>
  The dimensional reduction of the three-dimensional fermion-Chern-Simons model
(related to Hopf maps) of Adam et el. is shown to be equivalent to (i) either
the static, fixed--chirality sector of our non-relativistic spinor-Chern-Simons
model in 2+1 dimensions, (ii) or a particular Heisenberg ferromagnet in the
plane.
