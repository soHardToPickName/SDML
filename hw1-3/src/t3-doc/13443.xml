Semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The semi-classical spectrum of the Homogeneous sine-Gordon theories
associated with an arbitrary compact simple Lie group G is obtained and shown
to be entirely given by solitons. These theories describe quantum integrable
massive perturbations of Gepner's G-parafermions whose classical
equations-of-motion are non-abelian affine Toda equations. One-soliton
solutions are constructed by embeddings of the SU(2) complex sine-Gordon
soliton in the regular SU(2) subgroups of G. The resulting spectrum exhibits
both stable and unstable particles, which is a peculiar feature shared with the
spectrum of monopoles and dyons in N=2 and N=4 supersymmetric gauge theories.
