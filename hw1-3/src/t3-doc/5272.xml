<title>
Induced Lorentz and PCT Symmetry Breaking in an External Electromagnetic
  Field
</title>

<abstract>
  In this work we derive the Lorentz-PCT-violating effective action for a
fermion in a constant and uniform electromagnetic field using the
Fock-Schwinger proper time method and extract the exact value of the
coefficient of the nonperturbatively induced Chern-Simons term.
