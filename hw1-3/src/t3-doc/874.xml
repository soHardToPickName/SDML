Chern-Simons Theories in the AdS/CFT Correspondence
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the AdS/CFT correspondence for theories with a Chern-Simons term
in three dimensions. We find the two-point functions of the boundary conformal
field theories for the Proca-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model. We
also discuss particular limits where we find the two-point function of the
boundary conformal field theory for the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory. In
particular our results are consistent with the equivalence between the
Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and the Self-Dual model.
