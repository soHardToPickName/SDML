Symplectic leaves of W-algebras from the reduced Kac-Moody point of view
</title>

<abstract>
  The symplectic leaves of W-algebras are the intersections of the symplectic
leaves of the Kac-Moody algebras and the hypersurface of the second class
constraints, which define the W-algebra. This viewpoint enables us to classify
the symplectic leaves and also to give a representative for each of them. The
case of the (W_{2}) (Virasoro) algebra is investigated in detail, where the
positivity of the energy functional is also analyzed.
