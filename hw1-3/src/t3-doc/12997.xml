<title>
Dynamical symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with external
  gravitational and constant electric fields
</title>

<abstract>
  An investigation of the Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with external constant
electric and weak gravitational fields is carried out in three- and four-
dimensional spacetimes. The effective potential of the composite bifermionic
fields is calculated keeping terms linear in the curvature, while the electric
field effect is treated exactly by means of the proper- time formalism.
  A rich dynamical symmetry breaking pattern, accompanied by phase transitions
which are ruled, independently, by both the curvature and the electric field
strength is found. Numerical simulations of the transitions are presented.
