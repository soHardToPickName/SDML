Exactly Solvable Quantum Mechanical Models with Infinite Renormalization
  of the Wave Function
</title>

<abstract>
  The main difficulty of quantum field theory is the problem of divergences and
renormalization. However, realistic models of quantum field theory are
renormalized within the perturbative framework only. It is important to
investigate renormalization beyond perturbation theory. However, known models
of constructive field theory do not contain such difficulties as infinite
renormalization of the wave function. In this paper an exactly solvable quantum
mechanical model with such a difficulty is constructed. This model is a
simplified analog of the large-N approximation to the $\Phi\phi^a\phi^a$-model
in 6-dimensional space-time. It is necessary to introduce an indefinite inner
product to renormalize the theory. The mathematical results of the theory of
Pontriagin spaces are essentially used. It is remarkable that not only the
field but also the canonically conjugated momentum become well-defined
operators after adding counterterms.
