SU(2) gauged Skyrme-monopoles in scalar-tensor gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  Considering a Skyrme model with a peculiar gauging of the symmetry,
monopole-like solutions exist through a topological lower bound. However, it
was recently shown that these objects cannot form bound states in the limit of
vanishing Skyrme coupling. Here we consider these monopoles in scalar-tensor
gravity. A numerical study of the equations reveals that neither the coupling
to gravity nor to the scalar dilaton nor to dilaton-gravity leads to bound
multimonopole states.
