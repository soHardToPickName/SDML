<title>
On the Energy Momentum Tensor of the M-Theory Fivebrane
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct the energy momentum tensor for the bosonic fields of the
covariant formulation of the M-theory fivebrane within that formalism. We then
obtain the energy for various solitonic solutions of the fivebrane equations of
motion.
