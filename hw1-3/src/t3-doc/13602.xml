<title>
A generalized Lichnerowicz formula, the Wodzicki Residue and Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We prove a generalized version of the well-known Lichnerowicz formula for the
square of the most general Dirac operator $\widetilde{D}$\ on an
even-dimensional spin manifold associated to a metric connection
$\widetilde{\nabla}$. We use this formula to compute the subleading term
$\Phi_1(x,x, \widetilde{D}^2)$\ of the heat-kernel expansion of
$\widetilde{D}^2$. The trace of this term plays a key-r$\hat {\petit\rm o}$le
in the definition of a (euclidian) gravity action in the context of
non-commutative geometry. We show that this gravity action can be interpreted
as defining a modified euclidian Einstein-Cartan theory.
