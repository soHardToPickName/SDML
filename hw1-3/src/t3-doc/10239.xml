D-Branes in the Green-Schwarz Formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a basic account of supersymmetric open strings and D-branes using the
Green-Schwarz formalism, obtaining a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric
description of their spectrum. In addition we discuss a mechanism whereby some
of the D-brane states are projected out and which can lead to chiral quantum
field theories on the brane.
