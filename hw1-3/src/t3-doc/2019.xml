Infra-Red Stable Supersymmetry in Chern-Simons Theories with Matter and
  Quenched Disorder
</title>

<abstract>
  We study Abelian Chern-Simons field theories with matter fields and global
SU(N) symmetry in the presence of random weak quenched disorder. In the absence
of disorder these theories possess N=2 supersymmetric fixed points and
N=1 supersymmetric fixed lines in the infra-red limit. We show that
although the presence of disorder forbids any supersymmetry of the bare action,
infra-red stable supersymmetric fixed points and fixed lines are realized in
the disorder-averaged effective theories.
