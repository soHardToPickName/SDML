<title>
On quasi-exactly solvable matrix models
</title>

<abstract>
  An efficient procedure for constructing quasi-exactly solvable matrix models
is suggested. It is based on the fact that the representation spaces of
representations of the algebra sl(2,R) within the class of first-order matrix
differential operators contain finite dimensional invariant subspaces.
