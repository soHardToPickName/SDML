<title>
The Semiclassical Limit of the Two Dimensional Quantum Yang-Mills Model
</title>

<abstract>
  We relate the semiclassical limit of the quantum Yang-Mills partition
function on a compact oriented surface to the symplectic volume of the moduli
space of flat connections, by using an explicit expression for the symplectic
form. This gives an independent proof of some recent results of Witten and
Forman.
