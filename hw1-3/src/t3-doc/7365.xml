<title>
Non-Abelian Stokes Theorem for Loop Variables Associated with Nontrivial
  Loops
</title>

<abstract>
  The non-Abelian Stokes theorem for loop variables associated with nontrivial
loops (knots and links) is derived. It is shown that a loop variable is in
general different from unity even if the field strength vanishes everywhere on
the surface surrounded by the loop.
