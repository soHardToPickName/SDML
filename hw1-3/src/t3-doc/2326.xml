$N=1$ from $N=2$ Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We give a simple proof that a particular class of $N=2$ superstrings are
equivalent to the $N=1$ superstrings. This is achieved by constructing a
similarity transformation which transforms the $N=2$ BRST operators into a
direct sum of the BRST operators for the $N=1$ string and topological sectors.
