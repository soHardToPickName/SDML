<title>
Conformal Phase Transition in Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  The conception of the conformal phase transiton (CPT), which is relevant for
the description of non-perturbative dynamics in gauge theories, is introduced
and elaborated. The main features of such a phase transition are established.
In particular, it is shown that in the CPT there is an abrupt change of the
spectrum of light excitations at the critical point, though the phase
transition is continuous. The structure of the effective action describing the
CPT is elaborated and its connection with the dynamics of the partially
conserved dilatation current is pointed out. The applications of these results
to QCD, models of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking, and to the
description of the phase diagram in (3+1)-dimensional $ SU(N_c)$ gauge theories
are considered.
