<title>
Nonsingular Lagrangians for Two Dimensional Black Holes
</title>

<abstract>
  We introduce a large class of modifications of the standard lagrangian for
two dimensional dilaton gravity, whose general solutions are nonsingular black
holes. A subclass of these lagrangians have extremal solutions which are
nonsingular analogues of the extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. It is
possible that quantum deformations of these extremal solutions are the endpoint
of Hawking evaporation when the models are coupled to matter, and that the
resulting evolution may be studied entirely within the framework of the
semiclassical approximation. Numerical work to verify this conjecture is in
progress. We point out however that the solutions with non-negative mass always
contain Cauchy horizons, and may be sensitive to small perturbations.
