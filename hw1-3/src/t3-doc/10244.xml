Schwinger's Method for the Massive Casimir Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We apply to the massive scalar field a method recently proposed by Schwinger
to calculate the Casimir effect. The method is applied with two different
regularization schemes: the Schwinger original one by means of Poisson formula
and another one by means of analytical continuation.
