The Relation between Mixed Boundary States in Two- and Three- Matrix
  Models
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the relation among some disk amplitudes with non-trivial boundary
conditions in two-dimensional quantum gravity. They are obtained by the
two-matrix model as well as the three-matirx model for the case of the
tricritical Ising model. We examine them for simple spin configurations, and
find that a finite number of insertions of the different spin states cannot be
observed in the continumm limit. We also find a closed set of eight
Schwinger-Dyson equations which determines the disk amplitudes in the
three-matrix model.
