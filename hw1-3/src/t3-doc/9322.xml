Simplicial Chiral Models
</title>

<abstract>
  Principal chiral models on a d-1 dimensional simplex are introduced and
studied analytically in the large $N$ limit. The $d = 0, 2, 4$ and $\infty$
models are explicitly solved. Relationship with standard lattice models and
with few-matrix systems in the double scaling limit are discussed.
