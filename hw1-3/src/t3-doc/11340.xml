<title>
Towards a Naturally Small Cosmological Constant from Branes in 6D
  Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We argue that an effective four-dimensional cosmological constant can
naturally be of order 1/r^4 in six-dimensional supergravity compactified on two
dimensions having radius r, with supersymmetry broken on non-supersymmetric
3-branes (on one of which we live). In the scenario where the extra dimensions
are sub-millimeter in size, this is the correct size to describe the
recently-discovered dark energy. This mechanism therefore predicts a connection
between the observed size of the cosmological constant, and potentially
observable effects in sub-millimeter tests of gravity and at the Large Hadron
Collider. Corrections to this small cosmological constant remain small for two
reasons. For branes having specific properties, the large brane tensions due to
the zero-point energies of brane-bound particles are cancelled by the curvature
and dilaton of the transverse two dimensions. Six-dimensional supersymmetry
then enforces the cancellation of bulk modes down to their
supersymmetry-breaking scale, which is naturally of order 1/r. We find a
potential realization of the mechanism by inserting branes into an anomaly-free
version of Salam-Sezgin gauged 6D supergravity compactified on a 2-sphere with
nonzero magnetic flux.
