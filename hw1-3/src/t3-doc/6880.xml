<title>
The effective two-loop Euler-Heisenberg action for scalar and spinor QED
  in a general constant background field
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the Worldline formalism of QED we compute the two-loop effective action
induced by a charged scalar, respectively spinor particle in a general constant
electromagnetic field.
