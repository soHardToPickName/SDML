<title>
Algebraic aspect and construction of Lax operators in quantum integrable
  systems
</title>

<abstract>
  An algebraic construction more general and intimately connected with that of
Faddeev$^1$, along with its application for generating different classes of
quantum integrable models are summarised to complement the recent results of
ref. 1 ( L.D. Faddeev, {\it Int. J. Mod. Phys. } {\bf A10}, 1845 (1995) ).
