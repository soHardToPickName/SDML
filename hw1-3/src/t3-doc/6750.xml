<title>
BRST cohomology for 2D gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The BRST cohomology group in the space of local functionals of the fields for
the two-dimensional conformally invariant gravity is calculated. All classical
local actions (ghost number equal to zero) and all candidate anomalies are
given and discussed for our model.
