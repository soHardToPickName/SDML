<title>
Cosmology with the CFT-radiation matter
</title>

<abstract>
  We review the relation between entropy bounds to rewrite Friedmann equation
on the brane in terms of three entropy bounds: Bekenstein-Verlinde ($S_{BV}$);
Bekenstein-Hawking bound ($S_{BH}$); Hubble bound ($S_H$). For a strongly
coupled conformal field theory (CFT) with a dual 5-dimensional anti de Sitter
Schwarzschild (AdSS$_5$) black hole, we can easily establish the connection
between the Cardy-Verlinde formula on the CFT side and the entropy
representation of Friedmann equation in cosmology. In this case its
cosmological evolution for entropy is given by the semi-circle. However, for
the matter-dominated case, we find that the cosmological evolution diagram
takes a different form of the cycloid. Here we propose two different entropy
relations for matter-dominated case. It turns out that the Verlinde's entropy
relation so restricted that it may not be valid for the matter-dominated
universe.
