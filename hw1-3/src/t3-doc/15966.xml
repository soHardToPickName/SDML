Chern-Simons theory, matrix integrals, and perturbative three-manifold
  invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  The universal perturbative invariants of rational homology spheres can be
extracted from the Chern-Simons partition function by combining perturbative
and nonperturbative results. We spell out the general procedure to compute
these invariants, and we work out in detail the case of Seifert spaces. By
extending some previous results of Lawrence and Rozansky, the Chern-Simons
partition function with arbitrary simply-laced group for these spaces is
written in terms of matrix integrals. The analysis of the perturbative
expansion amounts to the evaluation of averages in a Gaussian ensemble of
random matrices. As a result, explicit expressions for the universal
perturbative invariants of Seifert homology spheres up to order five are
presented.
