Chiral non-linear sigma-models as models for topological
  superconductivity
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the mechanism of topological superconductivity in a hierarchical
chain of chiral non-linear sigma-models (models of current algebra) in one,
two, and three spatial dimensions. The models have roots in the 1D
Peierls-Frohlich model and illustrate how the 1D Frohlich's ideal conductivity
extends to a genuine superconductivity in dimensions higher than one. The
mechanism is based on the fact that a point-like topological soliton carries an
electric charge. We discuss a flux quantization mechanism and show that it is
essentially a generalization of the persistent current phenomenon, known in
quantum wires. We also discuss why the superconducting state is stable in the
presence of a weak disorder.
