4D Gravity on a Brane in 5D Minkowski Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We suggest a mechanism by which four-dimensional Newtonian gravity emerges on
a 3-brane in 5D Minkowski space with an infinite size extra dimension. The
worldvolume theory gives rise to the correct 4D potential at short distances
whereas at large distances the potential is that of a 5D theory. We discuss
some phenomenological issues in this framework.
