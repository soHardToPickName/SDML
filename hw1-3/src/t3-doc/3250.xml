Nonuniform symmetry breaking in noncommutative $\lambda \Phi^4$ theory
</title>

<abstract>
  The spontaneous symmetry breaking in noncommutative $\lambda\Phi^4$ theory
has been analyzed by using the formalism of the effective action for composite
operators in the Hartree-Fock approximation. It turns out that there is no
phase transition to a constant vacuum expectation of the field and the broken
phase corresponds to a nonuniform background. By considering
$<\phi(x)>=A \cos(\vec Q \cdot \vec x)$ the generated mass gap depends on the
angles among the momenta $\vec k$ and $\vec Q$ and the noncommutativity
parameter $\vec\theta$. The order of the transition is not easily determinable
in our approximation.
