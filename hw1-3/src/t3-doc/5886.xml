<title>
The one-loop effective action for quantum electrodynamics on
  noncomutative space
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we calculate the divergent part of the one loop effective
action for QED on noncommutative space using the background field method. The
effective action is obtained up to the second order in the noncommutative
parameter theta and in the classical fields.
