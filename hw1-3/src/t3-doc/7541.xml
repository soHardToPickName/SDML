Wall Solution with Weak Gravity Limit in Five Dimensional Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  In five-dimensional supergravity, an exact solution of BPS wall is found for
a gravitational deformation of the massive Eguchi-Hanson nonlinear sigma model.
The warp factor decreases for both infinities of the extra dimension. Thin wall
limit gives the Randall-Sundrum model without fine-tuning of input parameters.
We also obtain wall solutions with warp factors which are flat or increasing in
one side, by varying a deformation parameter of the potential.
