Superisometries of the adS*S Superspace
</title>

<abstract>
  We find the superisometry of the near-horizon superspace, forming the
superconformal algebra. We present here the explicit form of the transformation
of the bosonic and fermionic coordinates (as well as the compensating
Lorentz-type transformation) which keeps the geometry invariant. We comment on
 i) the BPS condition of the branes in adS background and
 ii) significant simplification of superisometries of the gauge-fixed
Green-Schwarz action in adS(5)*S(5) background.
