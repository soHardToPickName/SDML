Casimir Energy of a Spherical Shell
</title>

<abstract>
  The Casimir energy for a conducting spherical shell of radius $a$ is computed
using a direct mode summation approach. An essential ingredient is the
implementation of a recently proposed method based on Cauchy's theorem for an
evaluation of the eigenfrequencies of the system. It is shown, however, that
this earlier calculation uses an improper set of modes to describe the waves
exterior to the sphere. Upon making the necessary corrections and taking care
to ensure that no mathematically ill-defined expressions occur, the technique
is shown to leave numerical results unaltered while avoiding a longstanding
criticism raised against earlier calculations of the Casimir energy.
