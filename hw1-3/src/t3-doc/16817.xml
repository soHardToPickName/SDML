String Theories on the Asymmetric Orbifolds with Twist-Untwist
  Intertwining Currents
</title>

<abstract>
  We give various examples of asymmetric orbifold models to possess
intertwining currents which convert untwisted string states to twisted ones,
and vice versa, and see that such asymmetric orbifold models are severely
restricted. The existence of the intertwining currents leads to the enhancement
of symmetries in asymmetric orbifold models.
