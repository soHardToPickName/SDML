A note on the 3D Ising model as a string theory
</title>

<abstract>
  It has long been argued that the continuum limit of the 3D Ising model is
equivalent to a string theory. Unfortunately, in the usual starting point for
this equivalence -- a certain lattice theory of surfaces -- it is not at all
obvious how to take the continuum limit. In this note, I reformulate the
lattice theory of surfaces in a fashion such that the continuum limit is
straightforward. I go on to discuss how this new formulation may overcome some
fundamental objections to the notion that the Ising model is equivalent to a
string theory. In an appendix, I also discuss some aspects of fermion doubling,
and the lattice fermion formulation of the 2D Ising model.
