<title>
Local Magnetization in Critical Ising Model with Boundary Magnetic Field
</title>

<abstract>
  We discribe a simple way to derive spin correlation functions in 2D Ising
model at critical temperature but with nonzero magnetic field at the boundary.
Local magnetization (i.e. one-point function) is computed explicitly for
half-plane and disk geometries.
