String Vertices and Inner Derivations
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that it is algebraically consistent to express some string field
theory operators as inner derivations of the B-V algebra of string vertices. In
this approach, the recursion relations for the string vertices are found to
take the form of a `geometrical' quantum master equation. We also show that the
B-V delta operator cannot be an inner derivation on the algebra.
