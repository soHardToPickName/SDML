On the Matrix Description of Calabi-Yau Compactifications
</title>

<abstract>
  We point out that the matrix description of M-theory compactified on
Calabi-Yau threefolds is in many respects simpler than the matrix description
of a $T^6$ compactification. This is largely because of the differences between
D6 branes wrapped on Calabi-Yau threefolds and D6 branes wrapped on six-tori.
In particular, if we define the matrix theory following the prescription of Sen
and Seiberg, we find that the remaining degrees of freedom are decoupled from
gravity.
