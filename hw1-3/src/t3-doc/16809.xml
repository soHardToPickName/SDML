<title>
N=1 Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics on a Curved Space
</title>

<abstract>
  The quantum mechanics of an N=1 supersymmetric dynamical system constrained
to a hypersurface embedded in the higher dimensional Euclidean space is
investigated by using the projection-operator method (POM) of constrained
systems. It is shown that the Hamiltonian obtained by the successive operations
of projection operators contains the additional terms, which are completely
missed when imposing constraints before the quantization. We derive the
conditions the additional terms should satisfy when the N=1 supersymmetry holds
in the resulting system, and present the geometrical interpretations of these
additional terms.
