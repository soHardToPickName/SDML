Holographic Vacuum Energy
</title>

<abstract>
  Gravitational holography is argued to render the cosmological constant stable
against divergent quantum corrections. This provides a technically natural
solution to the cosmological constant problem. Evidence for quantum stability
of the cosmological constant is illustrated in a number of examples including,
bulk descriptions in terms of delocalized degrees of freedom, boundary screen
descriptions on stretched horizons, and non-supersymmetric conformal field
theories as dual descriptions of anti-de Sitter space. In an expanding
universe, holographic quantum contributions to the stress-energy tensor are
argued to be at most of order the energy density of the dominant matter
component.
