Spacetime Topology Change: The Physics of Calabi-Yau Moduli Space
</title>

<abstract>
  We review recent work which has significantly sharpened our geometric
understanding and interpretation of the moduli space of certain $N$=2
superconformal field theories. This has resolved some important issues in
mirror symmetry and has also established that string theory admits physically
smooth processes which can result in a change in topology of the spatial
universe.
