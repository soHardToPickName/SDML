<title>
Algebraic Bethe ansatz for the elliptic quantum group
  $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$ and its applications
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the tensor product of the {\it higher spin representations} (see the
definition in Sect. 2.2) of the elliptic quantum group $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$.
The transfer matrices associated with the $E_{\tau,\eta}(sl_n)$-module are
exactly diagonalized by the nested Bethe ansatz method. Some special cases of
the construction give the exact solution for the $Z_n$ Belavin model and for
the elliptic $A_{n-1}$ Ruijsenaars-Schneider model.
