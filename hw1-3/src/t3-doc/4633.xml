<title>
Hidden conformal symmetry of a massive scalar field in 2-dimensional
  Anti-De Sitter space
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that a massive scalar field on a 2-dimensional Anti-De Sitter space
can be mapped by means of a time-dependent canonical transformation into a
massless free field theory when the mass square of the field is equal to minus
the curvature of the background metric. We also provide the (hidden) conformal
symmetry of the massive scalar field.
