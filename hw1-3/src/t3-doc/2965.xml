<title>
On the multilevel generalization of the field--antifield formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  The multilevel geometrically--covariant generalization of the
field--antifield BV--formalism is suggested. The structure of quantum
generating equations and hypergauge conditions is studied in details. The
multilevel formalism is established to be physically--equivalent to the
standard BV--version.
