<title>
Cosmological Structure Problem of the Pre-Big Bang Scenario
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the density and gravitational wave spectrums generated in a
version of string cosmology termed pre-big bang scenario. The large scale
structures are originated from quantum fluctuations of the metric and dilaton
field during a pole-like inflation stage driven by a potential-less dilaton
field realized in the low-energy effective action of string theory. The
generated classical density field and the gravitational wave in the second
horizon crossing epoch show tilted spectrums with n ~ 4 and n_T ~ 3,
respectively. These differ from the observed spectrum of the large angular
scale anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation which supports
scale invariant ones with n ~ 1 and n_T ~ 0. This suggests that the pre-big
bang stage is not suitable for generating the present day observable large
scale structures, and suggests the importance of investigating the quantum
generation processes during stringy era with higher order quantum correction
terms.
