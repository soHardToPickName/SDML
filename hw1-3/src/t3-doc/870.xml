<title>
Low-Energy Scattering of Black Holes and p-branes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We discuss the low-energy dynamics of generalized extremal higher membrane
black hole solutions of string theory and higher membrane theories following
Manton's prescription for multi-soliton solutions. A flat metric is found for
those solutions which possess $\kappa$-symmetry on the worldvolume.
