WBase: a C package to reduce tensor products of Lie algebra
  representations
</title>

<abstract>
  It is nearly twenty years that there exist computer programs to reduce
products of Lie algebra irreps. This is a contribution in the field that uses a
modern computer language (``C'') in a highly structured and object-oriented
way. This gives the benefits of high portability, efficiency, and makes it
easier to include the functions in user programs. Characteristic of this set of
routines is the {\it all-dynamic} approach for the use of memory, so that the
package only uses the memory resources as needed.
