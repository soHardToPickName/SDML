<title>
Heat-Kernel Asymptotics of Locally Symmetric Spaces of Rank One and
  Chern-Simons Invariants
</title>

<abstract>
  The asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel associated with Laplace operators
is considered for general irreducible rank one locally symmetric spaces.
Invariants of the Chern-Simons theory of irreducible U(n)- flat connections on
real compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds are derived
