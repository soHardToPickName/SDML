<title>
Super-Poincare Invariant Koba-Nielsen Formulas for the Superstring
</title>

<abstract>
  The new spacetime-supersymmetric description of the superstring is used to
compute tree-level scattering amplitudes for an arbitrary number of massless
four-dimensional states. The resulting Koba-Nielsen formula is manifestly
SO(3,1) super-Poincare invariant and is easily generalized to scattering in the
presence of a D-brane.
