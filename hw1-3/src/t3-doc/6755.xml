<title>
KdV type hierarchies, the string equation and $W_{1+\infty}$ constraints
</title>

<abstract>
  To every partition $n=n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_s$ one can associate a vertex operator
realization of the Lie algebras $a_{\infty}$ and $\hat{gl}_n$. Using this
construction we make reductions of the $s$--component KP hierarchy, reductions
which are related to these partitions. In this way we obtain matrix KdV type
equations. Now assuming that (1) $\tau$ is a $\tau$--function of the
$[n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_s]$--th reduced KP hierarchy and (2) $\tau$ satisfies a
`natural' string equation, we prove that $\tau$ also satisfies the vacuum
constraints of the $W_{1+\infty}$ algebra.
