Anyons and Quantum Groups
</title>

<abstract>
  Anyonic oscillators with fractional statistics are built on a two-dimensional
square lattice by means of a generalized Jordan-Wigner construction, and their
deformed commutation relations are thoroughly discussed. Such anyonic
oscillators, which are non-local objects that must not be confused with
$q$-oscillators, are then combined \`a la Schwinger to construct the generators
of the quantum group $SU(2)_q$ with $q=\exp({\rm i}\pi\nu)$, where $\nu$ is the
anyonic statistical parameter.
