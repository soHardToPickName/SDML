The Sound of M-Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider sound propagation on M5- and M2-branes in the hydrodynamic limit.
In particular, we look at the low energy description of a stack of N M-branes
at finite temperature. At low energy, the M-branes are well described, via the
AdS/CFT correspondence, in terms of classical solutions to the eleven
dimensional supergravity equations of motion. From this gravitational
description, we calculate Lorentzian signature two-point functions of the
stress-energy tensor on these M-branes in the long-distance, low-frequency
limit, i.e. the hydrodynamic limit. The poles in these Green's functions show
evidence for sound propagation in the field theory living on the M-branes.
