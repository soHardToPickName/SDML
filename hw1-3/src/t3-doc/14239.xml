<title>
Two-point Functions in Affine Current Algebra and Conjugate Weights
</title>

<abstract>
  The two-point functions in affine current algebras based on simple Lie
algebras are constructed for all representations, integrable or non-integrable.
The weight of the conjugate field to a primary field of arbitrary weight is
immediately read off.
