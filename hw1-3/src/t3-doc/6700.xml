BPS D-branes after Tachyon Condensation
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct an effective action describing brane-antibrane system containing
N D-branes and N \bar{D}-branes. BPS equations for remaining D-branes after
tachyon condensation are derived and their properties are investigated. The
value of the D-brane tension and the number of brane bound states are
discussed.
