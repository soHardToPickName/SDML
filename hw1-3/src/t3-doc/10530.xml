<title>
Duality and an Operator Realization for the Fermi-Bose Transmutation in
  3+1 Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider the Maxwell-Higgs system in the broken phase, described in terms
of a Kalb-Ramond field interacting with the electromagnetic field through a
topological coupling. We then study the creation operators of states which
respectively carry a point charge and a closed magnetic string in the
electromagnetic language or a point topological charge and a closed Kalb-Ramond
charged string in the Kalb-Ramond dual language. Their commutation relation is
evaluated, implying they satisfy a dual algebra and their composite possesses
generalized statistics. In the local limit where the radius of the string
vanishes, only Fermi or Bose statistics are allowed. This provides an explicit
operator realization for statistical transmutation in 3+1D.
