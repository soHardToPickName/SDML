Divergences in formal variational calculus and boundary terms in
  Hamiltonian formalism
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown how to extend the formal variational calculus in order to
incorporate integrals of divergences into it. Such a generalization permits to
study nontrivial boundary problems in field theory on the base of canonical
formalism.
