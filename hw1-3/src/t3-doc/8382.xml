Light-Front Partons and Dimensional Reduction in Relativistic Field
  Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a simple discussion of the appearance of light-front partons in
local field theory.The description in terms of partons provides a dimensional
reduction which relates a 2+1 with a 3+1 dimensional theory for example. The
possibility for existence of Lorentz symmetry and a connection to the
relativistic membrane is described. It is shown how the reconstruction of the
full relativistic field theory is possible with a proper treatment of the
parton configuration space. Compared with the case of identical particles this
involves keeping configurations where the partons are at the same points.
