<title>
Geometrising the closed string field theory action
</title>

<abstract>
  We complete the set of string vertices of non-negative dimension by
introducing in a consistent manner those moduli spaces which had previously
been excluded. As a consequence we obtain a `geometrised' string action taking
the simple form $S=f(\B)$ where `$\B$' is the sum of the string vertices. That
the action satisfies the B-V master equation follows from the recursion
relations for the string vertices which take the form of a `geometrical'
quantum master equation.
