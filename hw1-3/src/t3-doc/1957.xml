Derivative Expansion in Quantum Theory of Gravitation
</title>

<abstract>
  The cosmological term prevents perturbation based on derivative expansion in
Einstein gravity. We consider quantum theory of gravitation invariant under
volume-preserving diffeomorphism and Weyl transformation, which is suitable for
derivative expansion.
