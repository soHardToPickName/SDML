<title>
Gauge symmetry and cosmological constant on a brane
</title>

<abstract>
  We have examined the localization of gauge bosons on the three-brane embedded
in 5D bulk space-time,and we find two kinds of branes as the candidate for our
world where both graviton and gauge bosons can be trapped. In one brane, the
cosmological constant $\lambda$ should be zero in order to find gauge bosons on
this brane. On another brane, a positive cosmological constant is needed to
trap the gauge bosons in the bulk,even if how small $\lambda$ is.Which brane is
realized depends on the configurations of the bulk.
