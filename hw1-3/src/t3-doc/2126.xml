<title>
Classification of 5-Dimensional Space-Time with Parallel 3-Branes
</title>

<abstract>
  If the fifth dimension is one-dimensional connected manifold, up to
diffeomorphic, the only possible space-time will be $M^4 \times R^1$, $M^4
\times R^1/Z_2$, $M^4 \times S^1$ and $M^4 \times S^1/Z_2$. And there exist two
possibilities on cosmology constant along the fifth dimension: the cosmology
constant is constant, and the cosmology constant is sectional constant. We
construct the general models with parallel 3-branes and with constant/sectional
constant cosmology constant along the fifth dimension on those kinds of the
space-time, and point out that for compact fifth dimension, the sum of the
brane tensions is zero, for non-compact fifth dimension, the sum of the brane
tensions is positive. We assume the observable brane which includes our world
should have positive tension, and obtain that the gauge hierarchy problem can
be solved in those scenarios. We also discuss some simple models.
