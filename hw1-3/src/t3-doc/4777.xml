Entropy of the Randall-Sundrum black brane world in the brick-wall
  method
</title>

<abstract>
  We calculate the entropy of the brane-world black hole in the
Randall-Sundrum(RS) model by using the brick-wall method. The modes along the
extra dimension are semi-classically quantized on the extra dimension. The
number of modes in the extra dimension is given as a simple form with the help
of the RS mass relation, and then the entropy for the scalar modes in the
five-dimensional spacetime is described by the two-dimensional area of the
black brane world.
