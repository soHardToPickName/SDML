Comment on "Duality of x and psi in quantum mechanics" by Faraggi and
  Matone
</title>

<abstract>
  The dual Schrodinger equation for x in terms of psi derived by Faraggi and
Matone [hep-th/9606063] with techniques inspired by field theory duality
can be derived almost trivially from differential calculus.
