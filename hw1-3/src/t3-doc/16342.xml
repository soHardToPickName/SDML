About The Enhancon Mechanism
</title>

<abstract>
  I study the enhancon mechanism for fractional D-branes in conifold and
orbifold backgrounds and show how it can resolve the ``repulson'' singularity
of these geometries. In particular I show that the consistency of the excision
process requires that the interior space be not empty.
