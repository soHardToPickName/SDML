Dbrane boundstate wavefunctions
</title>

<abstract>
  A simple WKB approximation gives explicit information about D0brane
boundstate wavefunctions, suggesting that at large $N$ each individual D0brane
has a wavefunction $\exp(- c r^{9/2}N^{-1/2}).$ Thus the velocity dependent
interaction energy $v^{4}r^{-7}$ leads to an effective confining potential that
grows as $r^{7}.$
