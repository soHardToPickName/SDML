Vanishing of Cosmological Constant in Dual Supergravity
</title>

<abstract>
  The vacuun configuration of dual supergravity in ten dimensions with one-loop
fivebrane corrections is analyzed. It is shown that the compactification of
this theory with rather general conditions to six-dimensional space leads to
zero value of cosmological constant.
