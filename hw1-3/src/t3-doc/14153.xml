<title>
BFV Quantization of Relativistic Spinning Particles with a Single
  Bosonic Constraint
</title>

<abstract>
  Using the BFV approach we quantize a pseudoclassical model of the spin one
half relativistic particle that contains a single bosonic constraint, contrary
to the usual locally supersymmetric models that display first and second class
constraints.
