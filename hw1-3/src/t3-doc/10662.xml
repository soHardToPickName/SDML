Hopf reductions, fluxes and branes
</title>

<abstract>
  We use a series of reductions, T-dualities and liftings to construct
connections between fractional brane solutions in IIA, IIB and M-theory. We
find a number of phantom branes that are not supported by the geometry, however
materialize upon untwisting and/or Hopf-reduction.
