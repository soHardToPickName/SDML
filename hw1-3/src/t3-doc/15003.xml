<title>
Gravitational and Axionic Backgrounds for Four-dimensional Superstrings
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct new four-dimensional superstring vacua with extended
superconformal symmetries. A non-trivial dilaton background implies the
existence of Abelian killing symmetries. These are used to construct dual
equivalent backgrounds in a way preserving the N=2 superconformal invariance.
