<title>
The Holography Hypothesis and Pre-Big Bang Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  The consequences of holography hypothesis are investigated for the
Pre-big-bang string cosmological models. The evolution equations are obtained
from the tree level string effective action. It is shown that $S/A$ is bounded
by a constant in each case, $S$ being the entropy within the volume bounded by
the horizon of area $A$.
