<title>
Asymptotic algebra for charged particles and radiation
</title>

<abstract>
  A C*-algebra of asymptotic fields which properly describes the infrared
structure in quantum electrodynamics is proposed. The algebra is generated by
the null asymptotic of electromagnetic field and the time asymptotic of charged
matter fields which incorporate the corresponding Coulomb fields. As a
consequence Gauss' law is satisfied in the algebraic setting. Within this
algebra the observables can be identified by the principle of gauge invariance.
A class of representations of the asymptotic algebra is constructed which
resembles the Kulish-Faddeev treatment of electrically charged asymptotic
fields.
