<title>
Gauge theory and renormalization (Erice, August 1994)
</title>

<abstract>
  Early developments leading to renormalizable non-Abelian gauge theories for
the weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions, are discussed from a
personal viewpoint. They drastically improved our view of the role of field
theory, symmetry and topology, as well as other branches of mathematics, in the
world of elementary particles.
