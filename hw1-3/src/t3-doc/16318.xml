<title>
Dynamics of the Born-Infeld dyons
</title>

<abstract>
  The approach to the dynamics of a charged particle in the Born-Infeld
nonlinear electrodynamics developed in [Phys. Lett. A 240 (1998) 8] is
generalized to include a Born-Infeld dyon. Both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian
structures of many dyons interacting with nonlinear electromagnetism are
constructed. All results are manifestly duality invariant.
