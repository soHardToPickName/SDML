Separation of Variables in the Classical Integrable SL(3) Magnetic Chain
</title>

<abstract>
  There are two fundamental problems studied by the theory of hamiltonian
integrable systems: integration of equations of motion, and construction of
action-angle variables. The third problem, however, should be added to the
list: separation of variables. Though much simpler than two others, it has
important relations to the quantum integrability. Separation of variables is
constructed for the $SL(3)$ magnetic chain --- an example of integrable model
associated to a nonhyperelliptic algebraic curve.
