<title>
Field Theory Dynamics from Branes in String Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  I review certain aspects of Hanany-Witten setups and other approaches used to
embed (and solve) gauge theories in string theory. Applications covered include
dualities in 4 and 3 dimensions, fixed points in 6 dimensions, phase
transitions between different geometric backgrounds and dualities between
branes and geometry.
