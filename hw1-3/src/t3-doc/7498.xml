Magnetic Solutions to 2+1 Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on a new solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations in 2+1
dimensions with a negative cosmological constant. The solution is static,
rotationally symmetric and has a non-zero magnetic field. The solution can be
interpreted as a monopole with an everywhere finite energy density.
