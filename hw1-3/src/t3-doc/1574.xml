Chaos in Superstring Cosmology
</title>

<abstract>
  It is shown that the general solution near a spacelike singularity of the
Einstein-dilaton-p-form field equations relevant to superstring theories and
M-theory exhibits an oscillatory behaviour of the
Belinskii-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz type. String dualities play a significant role
in the analysis.
