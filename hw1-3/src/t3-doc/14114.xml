$W_{1+\infty}, Similarity Transformation and Interplay Between Integer
  and Fractional Quantum Hall Effect
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider non-unitary similarity transformation, interconnecting the
$W_{1+\infty}$ algebra representations for the fractional $\nu=\frac{1}{2p+1}$
and integer $\nu=1$ filling fractions. This transformation corresponds to the
introduction of the complex abelian Chern-Simons gauge potentials, in terms of
which the field-theoretic description of FQHE can be developed. The Jain's
composite fermion approach and Lopez-Fradkin equivalence assertion are
considered from the point of view of unitary and similarity transformations. As
an application the second-quantized form of Laughlin function is derived.
