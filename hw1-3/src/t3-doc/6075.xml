Is Induced QCD really QCD? The preservation of asymptotic freedom by
  matter interactions
</title>

<abstract>
  The program of induced QCD requires that there exist self-interactions among
the heavy matter fields (an adjoint scalar and a few fermions in the
fundamental representation) which tend to spoil the asymptotic freedom of SU(N)
gauge theory. We consider general interactions between such matter fields and
show that, on the contrary, to two loops, they all tend to enhance asymptotic
freedom in the perturbative regime. This result casts doubt on whether induced
QCD is equivalent to real QCD.
