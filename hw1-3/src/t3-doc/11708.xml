<title>
Example of a Poincare anomaly in relativistic quantum mechanics
</title>

<abstract>
  The Poincare algebra of classical electrodynamics in one spatial dimension is
studied using light-cone coordinates and ordinary Minkowski coordinates. We
show that it is possible to quantize the theory by a canonical quantization
procedure in a Poincare invariant manner on the light-cone. We also show that
this is not possible when using ordinary coordinates. The physical reason of
this anomaly is analysed.
