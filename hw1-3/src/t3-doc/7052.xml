The Story of M
</title>

<abstract>
  The origins of the 11-dimensional supermembrane are recalled, and a curious
property is discussed: the field theory limit of a supermembrane in a
hyper-K\"ahler background is a 3-dimensional sigma-model with N=4
supersymmetry, but the higher-order fermion interactions of the supermembrane
generically break this to N=3.
