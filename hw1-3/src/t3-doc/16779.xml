<title>
On the constrained KP hierarchy
</title>

<abstract>
  An explanation for the so-called constrained hierarhies is presented by
linking them with the symmetries of the KP hierarchy. While the existence of
ordinary symmetries (belonging to the hierarchy) allows one to reduce the KP
hierarchy to the KdV hierarchies, the existence of additional symmetries allows
to reduce KP to the constrained KP.
