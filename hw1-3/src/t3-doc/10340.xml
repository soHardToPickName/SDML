<title>
Construction of the Vacuum String Field Theory on a non-BPS Brane
</title>

<abstract>
  In the framework of the Sen conjectures a construction of vacuum superstring
field theory on a non-BPS brane is discussed. A distinguished feature of this
theory is a presence of a ghost kinetic operator mixing GSO+/- sectors. A
candidate for such kinetic operator with zero cohomology is discussed.
