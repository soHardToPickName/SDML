Point Interactions from Flux Conservation
</title>

<abstract>
  We show that the physical requirement of flux conservation can substitute for
the usual matching conditions in point interactions. The study covers an
arbitrary superposition of $\delta$ and $\delta'$ potentials on the real line
and can be easily applied to higher dimensions. Our procedure can be seen as a
physical interpretation of the deficiency index of some symmetric, but not
self-adjoint operators.
