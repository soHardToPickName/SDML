Testing the Maldacena conjecture with SDLCQ
</title>

<abstract>
  We report on a test of the Maldacena conjecture. This string/field theory
correspondence has interesting applications. When combined with Rehren's
theorem, it has implications for issues concerning space-time structure and
Lorentz symmetry. Our results indicate that the conjecture is correct. We are
within 10-15% of the expected results, although the numerical evidence is not
yet decisive.
