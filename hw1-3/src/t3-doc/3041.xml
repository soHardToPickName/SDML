M-Theory N=1 Effective Supergravity in Four Dimensions
</title>

<abstract>
  We present a general `off-shell' description of the effective N=1
supergravity describing the low-energy limit of M-theory compactified on
(Calabi-Yau) x S1/Z2. In our formulation, the M-theory Bianchi identities are
imposed by the equations of motion of four-dimensional supermultiplets.
Modifications of these identities (resulting for instance from contributions
localized at orbifold singularities or non-perturbative sources like
five-branes) can then easily be implemented.
