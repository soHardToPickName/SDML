Effective action in general chiral superfield model
</title>

<abstract>
  The effective action in general chiral superfield model with arbitrary
k\"{a}hlerian potential $K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)$ and chiral (holomorphic) potential
$W(\Phi)$ is considered. The one-loop and two-loop contributions to
k\"{a}hlerian effective potential and two-loop (first non-zero) contribution to
chiral effective potential are found for arbitrary form of functions
$K(\bar{\Phi},\Phi)$ and $W(\Phi)$. It is found that despite the theory is
non-renormalizable in general case two-loop contribution to holomorphic
effective potential is always finite.
