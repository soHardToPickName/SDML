Ground State Structure and Low Temperature Behaviour of an Integrable
  Chain with Alternating Spins
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we continue the investigation of an anisotropic integrable spin
chain, consisting of spins $s=1$ and $s=\frac{1}{2}$, started in our paper
\cite{meissner}. The thermodynamic Bethe ansatz is analysed especially for the
case, when the signs of the two couplings $\bar{c}$ and $\tilde{c}$ differ. For
the conformally invariant model ($\bar{c}=\tilde{c}$) we have calculated heat
capacity and magnetic susceptibility at low temperature. In the isotropic limit
our analysis is carried out further and susceptibilities are calculated near
phase transition lines (at $T=0$).
