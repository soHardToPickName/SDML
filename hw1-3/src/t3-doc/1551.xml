Flux Stabilization of D-branes in NSNS Melvin Background
</title>

<abstract>
  In this paper we reexamine the D-brane spectrum in the Melvin background with
nonconstant NSNS B-field from the viewpoint of its world-volume and string
world-sheet theory. We find that the stable D2-D0 bound state exists even
though it does not wrap any nontrivial cycles. We show that this system is
stabilized by the presence of the NSNS B-field and the magnetic flux F.
Moreover from the non-abelian world-volume theory of D0-branes the bound state
is regarded as a system of D0-branes expanding into a fuzzy torus.
