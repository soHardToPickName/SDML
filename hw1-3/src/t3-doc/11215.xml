<title>
D0-branes with non-zero angular momentum
</title>

<abstract>
  In my talk I shall consider the mechanism of self-expansion of a system of N
D0-branes into high-dimensional non-commutative world-volume investigated by
Harmark and Savvidy. Here D2-brane is formed due to the internal angular
momentum of D0-brane system. The idea is that attractive force of tension
should be cancelled by the centrifugal motion preventing a D-brane system from
collapse to a lower-dimensional one. I shall also present a new extended
solution where a total of 9 space dimensions is used to embed a D0-brane
system. In the last section, by performing linear analysis, the stability of
the system is demonstrated.
