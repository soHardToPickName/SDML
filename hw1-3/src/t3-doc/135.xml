There might be superluminal particles in nature
</title>

<abstract>
  Based on experimental discovery that the mass-square of neutrino is negative,
a quantum equation for superluminal neutrino is proposed in comparison with
Dirac equation and Dirac equation with imaginary mass. A virtual particle may
also be viewed as superluminal one. Both the basic symmetry of space-time
inversion and the maximum violation of space-inversion symmetry are emphasized.
