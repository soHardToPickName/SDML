Remarks on the Star-Triangle Relation in the Baxter-Bazhanov Model
</title>

<abstract>
  In this letter we show that the restricted star-triangle relation introduced
by Bazhanov and Baxter can be obtained either from the star-triangle relation
of chiral Potts model or from the star-square relation which is proposed by
Kashaev $et ~al$ and give a response of the guess which is suggested by
Bazhanov and Baxter in Ref. \cite{b2}.
