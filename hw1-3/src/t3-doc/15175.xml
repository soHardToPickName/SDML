N=(4,4) 2D Supersymmetric Gauge Theory and Brane Configuration
</title>

<abstract>
  We construct type II A brane configuration of N=(4,4) supersymmetric two
dimensional gauge theory with gauge group U(1) and N_f hypermultiplets in the
fundamental representation. By lifting to M-theory (strong coupling), we can
see the origin of the R-symmetry enhancement of the Coulomb branch. One can
also find two theories which become equivalent at strong coupling.
