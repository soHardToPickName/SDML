Chiral Duals of Non-Chiral SUSY Gauge Theories
</title>

<abstract>
  We study $N=1$ SUSY gauge theories in four dimensions with gauge group
$Spin(7)$ and $N_f$ flavors of quarks in the spinorial representation. We find
that in the range $6< N_f < 15$, this theory has a long distance description in
terms of an $SU(N_f-4)$ gauge theory with a symmetric tensor and $N_f$
antifundamentals. As a spin-off, we obtain by deforming along a flat direction
a dual description of the theories based on the exceptional gauge group $G_2$
with $N_f$ fundamental flavors of quarks.
