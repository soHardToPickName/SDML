<title>
Self-Dual Chern-Simons Solitons in (2+1)-Dimensional Einstein Gravity
</title>

<abstract>
  We consider here a generalization of the Abelian Higgs model in curved space,
by adding a Chern--Simons term. The static equations are self-dual provided we
choose a suitable potential. The solutions give a self-dual
Maxwell--Chern--Simons soliton that possesses a mass and a spin.
