Supergravity interacting with bosonic p-branes and local supersymmetry
</title>

<abstract>
  We study the coupling of supergravity with a purely bosonic brane source
(bosonic p-brane). The interaction, described by the sum of their respective
actions, is self-consistent if the bosonic p-brane is the pure bosonic limit of
a super-p-brane. In that case the dynamical system preserves 1/2 of the local
supersymmetry characteristic of the `free' supergravity.
