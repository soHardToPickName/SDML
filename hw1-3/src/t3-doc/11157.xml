<title>
Non-critical string, Liouville theory and geometric bootstrap hypothesis
</title>

<abstract>
  Basing on the standard construction of critical string amplitudes we analyze
properties of the longitudinal sector of the non-critical Nambu-Goto string. We
demonstrate that it cannot be described by standard (in the sense of BPZ)
conformal field theory. As an alternative we propose a new version of the
geometric approach to Liouville theory and formulate its basic consistency
condition - the geometric bootstrap equation.
