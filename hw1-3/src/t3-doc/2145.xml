Symmetry Origin of Infrared Divergence Cancellation in Topologically
  Massive Yang-Mills Theory
</title>

<abstract>
  We manifestly verify that the miraculous cancellation of the infrared
divergence of the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory in the Landau gauge
is completely determined by a new vector symmetry existing in its large
topological mass limit, the Chern-Simons theory. Furthermore, we show that the
cancellation theorem proposed by Pisarski and Rao is an inevitable consequence
of this new vector symmetry.
